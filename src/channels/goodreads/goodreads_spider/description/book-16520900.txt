A college student collecting water samples is missing... Another collapses on a sea foam covered beach... Young adults start dying at coastal resorts... And no one knows why... THE RACE TO SAVE A GENERATION BEGINS NOW! DRS. KATE AND JAKE CONNORS are research professors at the Atlantic University Institute which is dedicated to peacefully resolving international conflicts caused by climate change. They also serve as covert agents for a privately-funded, secretive subdivision of the Institute known simply as the Agency. The Agency assigns its operatives to investigate and eliminate natural and human threats to the environment. As cover for their missions, the agents pose as visiting professors and graduate students at universities near crisis areas...sometimes walking the thin line between activists and extremists. While vacationing at Venice's Lido Beach, Kate and Jake witness one of the first cases of a normally passive waterborne bacterium attacking a person. Along the shores of the Mid-Atlantic States and Coastal Europe, one in ten people begin dying from exposure to the bacteria, and all of them are young adults in their twenties and thirties. When the CDC and WHO extrapolate for the bacteria entering the world's aquifers, they predict the death of an entire generation. Racing against time and across continents, Kate and Jake must find the cure for Bacillus nocturne, track down the rogue scientist who genetically modified the bacterium, and solve the mystery surrounding its specifically targeted victims before it contaminates the world's water supply.
