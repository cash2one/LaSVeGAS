7832957:::::The Charlatan's Boy:::::I only know one man who might be able to tell me where I come from, and that man is a liar and a fraud. As far back as he can remember, the orphan Grady has tramped from village to village in the company of a huckster named Floyd. With his adolescent accomplice, Floyd perpetrates a variety of hoaxes and flimflams on the good citizens of the Corenwald frontier, such as the Ugliest Boy in the World act. It s a hard way to make a living, made harder by the memory of fatter times when audiences thronged to see young Grady perform as The Wild Man of the Feechiefen Swamp. But what can they do? Nobody believes in feechies anymore. When Floyd stages an elaborate plot to revive Corenwalders belief in the mythical swamp-dwellers known as the feechiefolk, he overshoots the mark. Floyd s Great Feechie Scare becomes widespread panic. Eager audiences become angry mobs, and in the ensuing chaos, the Charlatan s Boy discovers the truth that has evaded him all his life and will change his path forever.
