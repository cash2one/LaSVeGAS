6056530:::::Coming Attractions:::::Are you serious? As graduation approaches, Katie Weldon is pretty sure she s ready for the word engaged to describe her relationship with Rick. But Eli seems to always be right there when she needs support. Rick is everything Katie s ever dreamed of, offering her stability and love. Eli, on the other hand, brings adventure, spontaneity, and a wild love for God. Katie wonders if she s ready to be serious with any guy. Maybe God wants her to seriously commit to Him first, whether her future is all planned out or as spontaneous as her impromptu life has been so far. One thing she knows for sure: With God alongside her, the coming attractions are bound to be a surprise. Coming Attractions is the third book in the Katie Weldon Series.
