12576078:::::River Cottage Veg Every Day!:::::"Call me power-crazed, but I'm trying to change your life here. The object of the exercise is to persuade you to eat more vegetables. Many more vegetables. And I hope to do so not by shouting from a soapbox, but through sheer temptation..." Why don't we eat more veg? They're healthy, cost-effective and, above all, delicious. Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall believes that it is time to put this to rights. He's come up with an abundance of veg-tastic recipes, including a couscous salad with herbs and walnuts, lemony guacamole, linguine with mint and almond pesto and tomatoes, baby carrots and broad bean risotto, new potato gnocchi, a summer stir-fry with egg-fried rice, a winter stir-fry with Chinese five-spice, a tomato, thyme and goat's cheese tart, a spring onion galette, roasted new potatoes with harissa, curried bubble and squeak, pea and parsley soup, quinoa with leeks and squash, baba ganoush, beetroot and walnut hummus, and spinach and new potato curry... With more than two hundred recipes, River Cottage Veg Every Day! is a timely eulogy to the glorious green stuff.
