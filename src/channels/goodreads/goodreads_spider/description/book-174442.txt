174442:::::House of Glass:::::In 1965, Pramoedya Ananta Toer was arrested by the Indonesian government. Although he was denied writing materials during his 14-year detention, he continued to "write" fiction, composing stories orally, which his fellow prisoners memorized. House of Glass is the final installment of the four-part epic he composed. The tale, which began with This Earth of Mankind and continued through Child of All Nations and Footsteps, encompasses the beginnings of the collapse of colonialism nearly 100 years ago. In 1995, Pramoedya Ananta Toer was cited by the Philippine government for his contribution to "the historical awakening and modern experience of the Indonesian people."The fourth volume in the series, the Buru Quartet, written by a critically lauded Indonesian writer and dissident, concludes the story of Minke, a bold, talented Indonesian collaborator with the colonialists.
