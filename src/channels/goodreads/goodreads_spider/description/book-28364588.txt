28364588:::::Three Kings:::::He was a great and brave king who conquered and ruled three adjacent lands. One day, he divided and gave the three lands to his three commanders to go to a faraway land where he built a new kingdom, Esquil. Thirty years had passed, and the three new kings decided to assassinate his son, so he sent his agents to these kingdoms to take revenge on them and reshape the territories. Their mission was to destroy the kingdoms from inside, but their specific plans were hidden from one another.
