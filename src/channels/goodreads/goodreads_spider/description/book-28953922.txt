28953922:::::The Diabolic:::::A Diabolic is ruthless. A Diabolic is powerful. A Diabolic has a single task: Kill in order to protect the person you ve been created for. Nothing else. For Nemesis, that person is Sidonia, heir to the galactic Senate. The two grew up side by side, and there s no one Nemesis wouldn t kill to keep her safe. But when the power-mad Emperor summons Sidonia to the Imperial Court as a hostage, there is only one way for Nemesis to protect Sidonia. She must become her. Now one of the galaxy s most dangerous weapons is masquerading in a world of corrupt politicians and two-faced Senators children, and Nemesis must find within herself the one thing she s been told she doesn t have humanity. With the Empire beginning to fracture and rebellion looming, that could be the one thing that saves her and the Empire itself.
