12011477:::::Walking with Zombies:::::Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to the Stockholm Club. Have we got a special treat for you tonight! We re privileged to have with us, a highly talented county and western singer, all the way from exotic Birmingham. I know that you ll give the lad a fantastic Yorkshire welcome. Don t forget, the first drink is on the house. Now before all you geriatric parasites slouch over to the bar and start making your way through my alcohol, I d just also like to mention that there is a chance that some of my staff may turn into flesh eating zombies as the night wears on. In fact, I think I can confidently predict that most of you will resemble jackal stripped zebra carcasses before the dawn sun makes an appearance. So please enjoy tonight s live entertainment and drink like there s no tomorrow. Let s face it; you ain t going to be seeing it. -------------------------------------------------------------- Despite attempts to quarantine the Breakspear housing estate, the infection has somehow spread further into the city. Whole neighbourhoods are falling to the undead plague. On the outskirts, the staff and customers of the Stockholm Club have no idea that the moaning dead are slowly shambling towards them.
