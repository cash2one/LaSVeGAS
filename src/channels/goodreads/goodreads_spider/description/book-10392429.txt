10392429:::::Tales of Wonder from the Garden State:::::Forget the New Jersey you think you know - the one crying out from over-development, heavy with strip malls, suburbs and the Jersey Turnpike. Travel back to the Garden State of Debbie Jones' youth. It's a place where peaches and lemons are free for the picking, a place where barefoot kids run in packs with local dogs, a place for the evening edition, the tire swing, the railroad trestle and the front porch. It is against this compelling and rich landscape that Jones cracks the veneer between the natural and supernatural. In Jones' Jersey, the extraordinary is ordinary for the people who live there and the Garden State is a place for all time that is about to change forever.
