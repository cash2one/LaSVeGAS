24396856:::::The Tapper Twins Tear Up New York:::::In the follow up to the New York Times bestseller The Tapper Twins Go to War, the twins' school scavenger hunt turns into a "madcap, uproarious romp around the Big Apple" full of "action, hilarity, and mayhem" ( School Library Journal ). Geoff Rodkey delivers another pitch-perfect ultra-modern comedy told as oral history with texts, screenshots and smartphone photos. When Claudia initiates a citywide scavenger hunt to raise money for charity, it's not just the twins' opposing teams that run riot. With the whole school racing to trade in sights seen for points to score front row tickets at Madison Square Garden, they may not get to the finish line with their dignity--and social lives--intact!
