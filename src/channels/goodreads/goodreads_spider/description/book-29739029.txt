29739029:::::Little Red:::::She s gone over the river and through the woods, but who will protect her from the Big Bad Wolf? Rojita is in trouble; all she needs to do is get to her grandmother in Everland, but she s being chased by El Lobo, one of the West s most notorious gunslingers. It isn t until she s thrown herself head-long into danger that she realizes the old adage about frying pans and fires applies. She s in desperate need of a protector, and hires the first man who comes along to get her safely to Everland. Bounty hunter Hank Cutter is more than ready to retire to a lonely little cabin in Arizona, to hang up his gun and find peace. He ll begrudgingly help the reckless young woman get to the nearest train station, because he figures she d get into even more trouble on her own. But when El Lobo struts back into his life Hank still has the scars from their last encounter he knows that he can t leave Rojita at the gunslinger s mercy. Maybe he s nobler than he d thought, because he s soon setting a trap to save the lovely, impetuous Red. The only problem is that she s still keeping a secret that could destroy his trust. ************************************************ The Brides of Everland, Ever After Step into Everland, Wyoming, where the people on the street are more than what they appear, and there s just a hint of magic in the air.
