13418864:::::Elemental:::::Earth, Fire, Air, Water they are more than you dream. As an air Elemental, 17-year-old Emily Morgan doesn t have much power. That s okay she knows what happens to kids who do. Like Michael Merrick. He s an earth Elemental, one with enough power to level cities. Which makes him sexy. Dangerous. And completely off limits. At least according to Emily s family. But her summer job puts her in close contact with Michael, and neither of them can help the attraction they feel. When forces of nature like theirs collide, one misstep could get someone killed. Because Emily s family doesn t just want her to stay away from him. They want him dead.
