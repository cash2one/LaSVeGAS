70897:::::The Secret History:::::Truly deserving of the accolade Modern Classic, Donna Tartt's cult bestseller The Secret History is a remarkable achievement - both compelling and elegant, dramatic and playful.

But when they go beyond the boundaries of normal morality their lives are changed profoundly and for ever.
