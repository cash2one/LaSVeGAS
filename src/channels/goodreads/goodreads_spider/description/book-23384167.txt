23384167:::::J.R.R. Tolkien's Lost English Mythology:::::A path-breaking account of Tolkien s Middle-earth as the lost world of ancient English mythology. In this essay the award winning intellectual historian, Simon J. Cook, explores Tolkien s lifelong project of reconstructing the ancient traditions of the North myths and legends once at the heart of English culture but forgotten after the Anglo-Saxon settlement of the British Isles. Cook situates The Silmarillion, The Hobbit, and The Lord of the Rings in relation to Edwardian scholarship on the prehistory of Northern Europe and the origin of the English nation. Taking us through three key stages of his creative writing, Cook shows how Tolkien crafted stories that fit and illuminate our fragmentary knowledge of ancient English traditions. By the end of his essay, Aragorn, Arwen, and Frodo appear in a new light no longer just icons of modern fantasy, but also the original heroes of a lost English mythology.
