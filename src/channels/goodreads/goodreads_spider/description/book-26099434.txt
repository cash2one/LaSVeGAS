26099434:::::Tethered Bond:::::Detective Drake Nash: hot, alpha, bossy, and mine. Now, if someone could tell his ex that... I don t care if the summer fayre is coming to Holly Woods and she s on the planning committee. What I do care about is sugar-filled food, bright lights, late nights and danger. The type that won t come in the form of Nonna s new cantankerous British parrot, Gio. (Please see the damage done to Mom s new curtains.) Unfortunately, when the danger comes, it comes in the form of something Holly Woods has never seen. The town is rocked to its core, and once again, I m in danger. Only this time, it isn t because of my clients this time, I m in danger because of who I am Because of my heritage. And despite the HWPD s best efforts, the bodies keep on piling up. Drake s determined to protect me. I m determined that I can do it myself. Danger. Mystery. Darkness. Malice. It ll be a miracle if any of us make it out of this with guns unfired, cupcakes still frosted, and hearts intact
