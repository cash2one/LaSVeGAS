3539006:::::The Dunwich Horror and Other Stories:::::In the degenerate, unliked backwater of Dunwich, Wilbur Whately, a most unusual child, is born. Of unnatural parentage, he grows at an uncanny pace to an unsettling height, but the boy's arrival simply precedes that of a true horror: one of the Old Ones, that forces the people of the town to hole up by night. This edition is part of the Penguin Gothic Horror series designed by Coralie Bickford-Smith.
