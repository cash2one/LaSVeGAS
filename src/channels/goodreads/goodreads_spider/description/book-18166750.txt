18166750:::::Switched:::::Ever since high school, Kayla has been crazy for gorgeous football player Talon. But before she could muster the courage to tell him, he became a hot item with her beautiful BFF, Reagan. The only person who knows Kayla s secret is Wesley, Talon s best bud and he s got it bad for Reagan. Now they re all in college together, hanging out 24/7. For Kayla, seeing the two lovebirds together is absolutely unbearable. So Kayla and Wesley hatch a plot to drive them apart before Talon has a chance to give Reagan the Christmas gift she s been waiting for. Soon enough, the once happy couple is fighting. Reagan suddenly can t get enough of Wesley s goofy sense of humor, and Talon seems to be paying more attention to Kayla than a guy who s only a friend ever should. But just when everything seems to be falling into place, Kayla and Wesley accidentally spend a night together and discover a hitch in their plan they never considered: that switching partners may not lead to a perfect ending after all.
