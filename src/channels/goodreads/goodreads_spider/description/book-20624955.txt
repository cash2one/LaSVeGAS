20624955:::::Bigfoot:::::Jeremiah comes from an ancient line of shifters whose presence has been talked about for generations, but never confirmed. He hid his secret for years, until he makes a drastic mistake by being seen in his other form, an error that could easily cost him and others of his kind their lives. James can't believe what he saw in the trees behind his home, telling himself it was nothing more than his distraught mind playing tricks on him, still, the sighting plagues him. Taking to the mountain, he seeks out proof of what he saw, ignoring the danger it could bring. Two lives changed in a glance, two men drawn together by fate, and secrets some would kill to protect. These two are about to find that it takes more than a shared attraction to make a relationship work.
