6941324:::::Beyond the Darkness:::::He Would Do Anything to Claim Her Salvatore Giuliani is not a happy werewolf. It's his duty as leader to track down the pure-blood females who can keep his people from extinction. But the moment he catches scent of Harley, a pure-blood held by a pack of mangy curs, his savage need for her obliterates all other instincts. And the only thing worse than being captured is finding that beautiful, independent Harley defiantly refuses to become his mate. And Everything to Keep Her Harley has been taught to distrust all Weres, especially their arrogant king. She won't be used for breeding or bonded against her will, not even to a man who makes every nerve tingle with awareness. Yet Salvatore is her key to saving the family she never knew she had if she dares to succumb to his dark, predatory desire, and face a vicious enemy sworn to destroy them both. . .
