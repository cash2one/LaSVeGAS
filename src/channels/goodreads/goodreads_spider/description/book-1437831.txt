1437831:::::Death to Spies:::::Was Ian Fleming a master spy? After years of serving in the intelligence community, Ian Fleming retired and soon thereafter created James Bond, that debonair, dashing hero of countless novels and films. But what if Fleming never really retired from spying? What if his position as an international journalist was really a cover for Cold War cat-and-mouse games? In Death to Spies , Ian Fleming, master operative, steps out from the shadow of his creation to take his rightful place in the pantheon of fictional spies. Fleming s idyll on the island of Jamaica is disrupted when a ranking member of British Intelligence shows up with a wild story of purloined nuclear secrets and moles within British Intelligence, then mysteriously disappears, apparently the victim of foul play. Investigating, Fleming faces hostility in Los Alamos--where anyone not American is automatically suspect--meets a glamorous, sexy woman with few scruples, and narrowly survives several attempts on his life.
