23342284:::::The Fear and the Solace:::::A FANTASY THRILLER - BOOK 2 of the KYRENNEI SERIES What if the forces of hatred could steal your soul? Despair has always dogged the heels of those who defy Addin mind control. Now Aranka Miko, the girl who could shield the resistance against infiltration, has gone down in a rain of bullets. Twenty-two-year-old Cho is the temporary commander of the J. Company compound in Montana when disaster strikes. The scouting team with Aranka was ambushed and the first spark of hope in a thousand years is lost. If the rest are captured, their wills and minds will be usurped by the Addin cult. Then Cho will be on her own in a secret war that cannot be won. Two of her closest friends are already dead and the man she loves is at the epicenter of the peril. Hope is a fragile thing and fear is a constant companion. It's the twenty-first century, right now, in America and everything looks just fine on the surface. But a clandestine force controls the highest seats of power and will stop at nothing to stamp out resistance. The ancient Meikan people, like Cho, have lived in terror of the Addin for generations, and those who dared to stand up to its power were shunned as outlaws by their own people. Then a mere girl fulfilled an almost forgotten prophecy and hope briefly flowered in unlikely places. But does a giant even notice the crushing of a single flower? One girl is easy enough to kill.
