8144969:::::What a Girl Wants:::::She's got the moxie. He's got the sexy. "Life's a beach. Then you have sex on it." Travel journalist Maddie Saunders has new attitude, and wants two new accessories to go with it. One, turn her triple-X fantasies into reality with Mr. Sex-On-Legs-her friend, Alex Donovan. And two, find her biological father to see if her gene pool has a deep end. She never expected fulfilling both wishes would take her life down a drastically different path. "Sometimes you're the windshield, and sometimes you're the bug." Alex, an investigative reporter, grits his teeth when he accepts a joint assignment to Hawaii with Maddie. He's vowed to never get involved with any woman he can't walk away from. Maddie falls under the heading of "Look, but don't touch." Trouble is, she excels at giving him a hard time-in more ways than one. He manages to fend off her guerilla seduction tactics until a bone-melting kiss throws his resolve into the ocean. Complicated? Absolutely. Especially when he discovers the real reason they were sent to the island...

Contents include, one kick-ass heroine and a sex-on-legs hero whose kiss could singe the eyebrows off a mannequin. Can be read in bed with someone special or a BOB (battery operated boyfriend).
