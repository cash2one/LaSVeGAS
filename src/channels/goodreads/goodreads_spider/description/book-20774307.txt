20774307:::::Selfish Little Bob, Selfish No More!:::::A RHYMING BOOK ABOUT SELFISH ACTIONS THAT CAN HELP SHOW CHILDREN HOW TO BECOME A MORE SELFLESS PERSON AND A LESS SELFISH ONE. In a little burrow all covered with vines lived a cute little rabbit-but a selfish one! Little Bob the rabbit was as cute as can be, But he had not any manners, as you will see, At breakfast, when Mom would fill his cup, He'd whistle and stare or just look up. Mom thought it was somewhat strange that he was four years old, soon to be five, and still behaved so badly. Something happens as the little rabbit ventured into the woods! Will he change? Each rhyme is accompanied by charming illustrations by well-known illustrator, Emily Zieroth.
