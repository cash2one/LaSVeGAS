Since then, David has been living with his lover, Lord Murdo Balfour, while he recuperates. Despite the pain of his injuries, David s time with Murdo has been the happiest of his life. The only things that trouble him are Murdo s occasional bouts of preoccupation, and the fact that one day soon, David will have to return to his legal practice in Edinburgh. That day comes too soon when David s friend and mentor takes to his deathbed, and David finds himself agreeing to take on a private mission in London. Murdo is at his side in the journey, but a shocking revelation by Murdo s ruthless father leaves David questioning everything they ve shared. As tensions mount and the stakes grow higher, David and Murdo are forced to ask themselves how far they re prepared to go and how much they re prepared to give up to stay together. And whether there s any chance of lasting happiness for men like them. Warning: Men in love, men with secrets, and men armed with dueling pistols.
