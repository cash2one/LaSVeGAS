916652:::::Halfway to the Sky:::::Twelve-year-old Dani is running away from home, or what s left of home anyway. Her older brother, who had muscular dystrophy, died a few months ago. Then her father left and her parents got divorced. Now home is just Dani and her sad, silent mother, and Dani s got to get away. She plans to do something amazing, and go where her parents will never find her: she s going to hike the whole Appalachian Trail, from Georgia to Maine. The trail is a legend in her family, the place where her parents met, fell in love, and got married 14 years before. Unfortunately for her master plan, her mother doesn t have much trouble figuring out where Dani s gone. Now it s the two of them, hiking for as long as Dani can manage to persuade her mother to keep going. But Dani s got an even longer emotional journey to make and it s one she and her mom need to make together. From the Hardcover edition.
