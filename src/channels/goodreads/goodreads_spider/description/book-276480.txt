276480:::::Apocalypse Culture II:::::When it was published in 1987, Apocalypse Culture was the first of its kind. No other book examined such disturbing cultural extremes, and no other book looked at the dark sides of society within the framework of the apocalypse. In the intervening 12 years, it has become clear that Apocalypse Culture inspired a new genre of cultural commentary that has been embraced by both independent and large mainstream publishers and eagerly sought after by the culture at large. Among its fans is X-Files creator Chris Carter. Now Adam Parfrey offers a follow-up to that first book. Apocalypse Culture II is an entirely new collection of essays that reflect the most recent revelations of the New World Order. Through the extremes of postmodern culture it details the moral disintegration of the old world. Essays cover biological warfare, taboo art, sexual fetishism, mind control for corporate gain, government sex-slavery, creepy superstars, and more.
