35131974:::::My Roommate's Girl:::::The day a judge gave me the choice between going to prison or going to college was the day I vowed to stop stealing. Never again would I see something beautiful and beyond my means and take it, just because I wanted it. Just because I could. When I moved in with Jerry, it was with good intentions. I needed a place to live while I got my degree, and he needed a roommate. Then I saw Aster. Blond and beautiful, good, pure, sweet, smart and Jerry s girlfriend. She was everything I never thought I could have. Except maybe I can. So I put a plan into action. Yeah, I d probably go to hell, but it would be worth it. I wanted Aster. I wanted her yesterday and tomorrow and every possible way. But you know what they say. Be careful what you wish for because you just might get it.
