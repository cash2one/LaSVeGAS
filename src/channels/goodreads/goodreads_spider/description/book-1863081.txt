1863081:::::The Victory:::::1803: Napoleon is poised to invade England, with only Nelson's weather-beaten ships in his way, but the French fleet are not the only threat to the fortunes of the Morland family. In the North of England, Mary Ann's relationship with the missionary, Father Rathbone, introduces her to the stark realities of life in plague-torn Manchester. In the South, Lucy's lover, Weston, is assigned to the blockade of Brest, while her neglected husband, Chetwyn, finally finds love in an affair which threatens him with disgrace and ruin. From the fashionable salons of Beau Brummell's London to the shot-torn docks at Trafalgar, the Morlands face danger and personal tragedy, as well as love and fulfilment.
