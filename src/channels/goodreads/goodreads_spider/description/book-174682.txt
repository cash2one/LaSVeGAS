174682:::::Burying the Shadow:::::In idyllic Taparak, young Rayojinni trains and awaits her initiation into the ranks of the soulscapers--the practitioners who heal the mental and spiritual ills of the people. Far away in glittering Sacramente, the elite artisans of the Eloim live in isolation, hiding their true non-human nature from the public who adore their culture, art and philosophy. But all is not well for the Eloim, who are succumbing to a a disease called "The Fear", bringing death and despair among their ranks for the first time. And no soulscaper is able to help them. Eloim actress Gimel and her brother Beth decide they need a child, a soulscaper young enough they can be trained to cope with their alien psyches--and they have chosen Rayojinni.
