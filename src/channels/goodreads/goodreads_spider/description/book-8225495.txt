8225495:::::My Avenging Angel:::::To save her life, he must break a covenant-and lose his heart. An Angels and Demons story. It's Victoria Bloom's twenty-fifth birthday. But is she out celebrating? Oh, no. She's in a stuffy old attic with the Three Stooges-a.k.a. her so-called spirit guides. There's a demon who wants her dead, the same one that killed her mother two decades ago. No worries, say the Stooges. All she has to do is summon an angel. What could go wrong? Well, plenty when you summon the wrong angel. The next thing Tory knows, she's got one very bad-ass, pissed-off and sexy Archangel on her hands. Michael, mighty warrior, leader of an elite team of demon killers, is shaking in his heavenly combat boots. Not because he finds all humans distasteful. But because he'd rather face Lucifer himself than the woman his soul has just recognized as his mate. Binding himself to a mortal, one who will eventually die, is the one path he's sworn never to follow. It's too late now; his fate is sealed. With one touch, she becomes as necessary to him as the air he breathes. He will move heaven and earth to protect her-but against a demon as powerful as Asmodeus, heaven and earth may not be enough . . .
