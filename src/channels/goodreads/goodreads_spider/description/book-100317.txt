100317:::::Happy Birthday, Kit: A Springtime Story:::::Kit's tenth birthday is approaching, but the chances of having a celebration are pretty slim. There's no time to plan a party and no money either, since Dad still doesn't have a job. When Aunt Millie comes for a visit, Kit finds new reasons to hope. With her thriftiness and good ideas, Aunt Millie seems to be able to do anything but usually in the most unexpected way!
