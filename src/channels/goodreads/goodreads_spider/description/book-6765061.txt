6765061:::::Home Free:::::Growing up in the 1960s, Lee Mets knows that it's not easy for a girl to be anything she wants. But she won't let that stop her from her dream of being a writer. Lee's favorite story of all time is Anne of Green Gables, so Lee is thrilled when a real-life orphan, by the name of Cassandra, moves in across the street. A summer with Cassandra leads to the girls performing Lee's play for the whole neighborhood. It also leads Lee to realize that being an orphan is not as romantic as she had thought. Sharon Jennings is an editor and award-winning author, having written over sixty books for young people. As a girl Sharon enjoyed writing plays, just like Lee. Although, unlike Lee, she always cast herself in the starring role. Sharon lives in Toronto, Ontario.
