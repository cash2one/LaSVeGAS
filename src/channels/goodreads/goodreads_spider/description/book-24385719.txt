24385719:::::The Slave Auction:::::Sixty years after the Final War smashed the countries of the world, the remnants of humanity are still working to rebuild civilization. In Scotia village, deep in the forests of what was once northwestern California, that s taken the form of a return to feudalism, with the warrior descendants of pre-War survivalists forming the nobility. Below them are their tenant farmers, a few independent priests and artisans and at the bottom of the pyramid, the slaves. Eliza Cronin is the young head of the most powerful noble house in Scotia, with all the duties that accompany such a station. And as she s yet to find a suitable consort, one who will treat her as an equal, she s largely doing it alone. So she goes to the local slave sale, seeking someone who can help her manage her myriad responsibilities. But she quickly finds that Aaron, the slave she purchases, is more than she expected. Physically weak but with a strong mind, Aaron is soon turning her life upside down, and causing her to discover things about herself she never would have guessed, both good and bad. Nor is all her stress coming from inside her house. There s also a masked rapist targeting Scotia s noblewomen (who may have picked Eliza s cousin as his next victim). A fellow noble, her good friend and closest advisor, is nearing death. On top of that, there are whispers of a conspiracy against not only her, but the entire village. In the midst of all this, plans will have to be formulated, serious choices need to be made, lives will be at stake. And it seems only a lowly slave has what she needs to navigate the crises ahead ... and maybe even find love A world torn by war. A noblewoman seeking help in a climate of fear. A hero in an unlikely disguise. And a romance for the ages. The Slave Auction is all that and more. Prepare for the future. (Suitable for adult and young adult readers, and for fans of science fiction, thrillers and romances.)
