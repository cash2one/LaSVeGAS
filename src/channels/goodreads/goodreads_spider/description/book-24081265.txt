24081265:::::A Lion in Your Number:::::Twenty-two-year-old diarist Sally Fairfax is both beautiful and Autistic. After tinkering with her daily entries, fibbing to not only herself but her "Future Self," Sally feels she is misinterpreted for her pleasing outside looks and shunned for her eccentric ideals; unable to execute them to her womanly advantage. From losing mundane dead-end jobs, clubbing with her illustrious friend "Molly," and even vacationing inside Magic Kingdom, Sally's adventurous life is, as she puts it, "full of Lions inside Numbers." From the author of Biflocka comes a gritty, quirky-humored epistolary novel written from the troubled mind of a beautiful female with Aspergers Syndrome.
