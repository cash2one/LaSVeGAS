13421358:::::Mistakes Were Made : Why We Justify Foolish Beliefs, Bad Decisions, and Hurtful Acts:::::UNABRIDGED Publisher's Summary Why do people dodge responsibility when things fall apart? Why the parade of public figures unable to own up when they screw up? Why the endless marital quarrels over who is right? Why can we see hypocrisy in others but not in ourselves? Are we all liars? Or do we really believe the stories we tell? Backed by years of research and delivered in lively, energetic prose, Mistakes Were Made (But Not by Me) offers a fascinating explanation of self-deception - how it works, the harm it can cause, and how we can overcome it. 2008 Carol Tavris and Elliot Aronson (P)2010 Audible, Inc. What the Critics Say "Thanks, in part, to the scientific evidence it provides and the charm of its down-to-earth, commonsensical tone, Mistakes Were Made is convincing. Reading it, we recognize the behavior of our leaders, our loved ones, and if we're honest ourselves, and some of the more perplexing mysteries of human nature begin to seem a little clearer." (Francine Prose, O, The Oprah Magazine) "By turns entertaining, illuminating and when you recognize yourself in the stories it tells mortifying." (The Wall Street Journal)
