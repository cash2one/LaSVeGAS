2804962:::::New Encyclopedia Of The Dog:::::It's important to choose our friends wisely, and relationships with man's best friend require a special kind of wisdom. Renowned veterinarian Bruce Fogle ( Natural Dog Care ) has compiled over 400 pages of helpful advice concerning canine companions, and those looking to learn more about their favorite breeds need look no further. The New Encyclopedia of the Dog 's six chapters are filled with gorgeous photos illustrating dogs of all ages from every breed imaginable. While the majority of the book is devoted to explanations of specific breeds, five short chapters provide information on evolution, domestication, health and anatomy, communication, and the roles dogs have played in recent human history. With historical photographs of tapestries, ceramics, and movie posters, as well as intricate diagrams of canine anatomy and charts outlining proper health care, these chapters provide great material for middle-school research papers or science-fair projects. The 310 pages that fall within the "Domestic Dog Breed" chapter are further divided into nine categories of dogs that range from fascinating primitives to hard-working livestock and guarding dogs. Each breed has multiple photos, both as an adult and a puppy, and a standard set of information that includes size, weight, life expectancy, date and country of origin, and AKC registration. A few simple icons, explained in this chapter's introduction, provide you with information at a glance--when learning about new breeds, you'll know right away if the dog requires extensive grooming and plenty of exercise, or is suitable for small children and city dwelling. From the popular golden retriever to the exotic xoloitzcuintli, the perfect pooches in these photos would melt even the heart of Cruella DeVille. --Jill Lightner
