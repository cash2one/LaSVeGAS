989560:::::Resurrection:::::From the New York Times bestselling author of MEG: A Novel of Deep Terror. Mayan legend tells of the Hero Twins, destined to confront the Lords of the Underworld and rescue their long-lost father from the realm of darkness. A two-thousand-year-old myth-or a prophecy of an apocalyptic battle for the soul of mankind? On December 21, 2012, a date long foretold by the Mayan calendar, Michael Gabriel disappeared from the face of the Earth after saving the entire planet from thermonuclear destruction. Less than a year later, his bereaved wife gave birth to twin sons, both possessed of extraordinary mental and physical gifts. Are these at last the Hero Twins? As crucial as the twins are, they are not unique. A third child has been born, blessed-or cursed-with the same superhuman talent and potential. Born into poverty, raised in obscurity, the seductive Lilith may be the key to humanity's ultimate future. Once again, as in Domain, Steve Alten has ingeniously woven the mysteries of the past into a gripping and unforgettable vision of the future.
