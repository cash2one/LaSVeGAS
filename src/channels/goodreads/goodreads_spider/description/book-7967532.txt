7967532:::::Who Will Comfort Toffle?: A Tale of Moomin Valley:::::A SCANDINAVIAN MIDCENTURY CLASSIC BACK IN PRINT Who Will Comfort Toffle? is the timeless, magical tale of the wistful wallflower, Toffle-too shy to speak to anyone and too fearful of the world he is watching from afar. Lonely and sad, Toffle runs away from home and watches the magical cast of Moomin Valley-Mymble, My, Snufkin, the merry whompses and the Fillyjonk-celebrate and enjoy life. His insecurity continues to only serve his isolation until he has the courage to overcome his fears by reaching out to another frightened introvert, the mesmerizing Miffle. Who Will Comfort Toffle? is an endearing, introspective story that will speak to readers of all ages-anyone who has ever needed a friend to pull them out of their shell. Joining Drawn &amp; Quarterly's archival series of Moomin The Complete Tove Jansson Comic Strip , Moomin, Mymble &amp; Little My , and the Moomintroll chapter books is the glorious reprinting of the Tove Jansson classic children's book Who Will Comfort Toffle? with a loving translation by British poet Sophie Hannah.
