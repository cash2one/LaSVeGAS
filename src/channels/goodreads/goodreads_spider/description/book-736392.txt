736392:::::Shadow Over Kiriath:::::After months of conflict and opposition, Abramm Kalladorne has finally stepped into his destiny as king of Kiriath--only to find himself facing more problems than ever. The Mataio remains antagonistic, the failed rebellion's supporters have slipped through his grasp to plot anew, bad luck plagues his every attempt to build Kiriath's defenses...and that's just the beginning. As the forces of the Black Moon advance toward Kiriathan shores, Abramm agrees to a desperately needed alliance-by-marriage with neighboring Chesedh. But with the hour for his union approaching, he is horrified to discover that he has become dangerously attracted to his fianc e's younger sister, the headstrong Lady Madeleine. Even worse, he learns that his attraction is reciprocated--just the sort of situation his enemies can use to destroy everything he's trying to accomplish. And Eidon just might let them succeed. Treachery and faithfulness, guilt and forgiveness, the joy of desires fulfilled and the pain of tragic loss all weave the tapestry of one man's destiny realized--where mind-boggling blessings come wrapped in a mantle of suffering that will test Abramm's faith to the limit and challenge everything he thinks he knows about himself and the one who owns his soul.
