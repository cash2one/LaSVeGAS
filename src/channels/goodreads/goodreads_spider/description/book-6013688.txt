6013688:::::The Midnight Dancers:::::Why live in the light, when the night seems so irresistible? Rachel Durham, 18, is tired of her father and stepmother s staid morality and pristine prosperity. The summer of her senior year, she s more than ready for a walk on the wild side, and the door opens - literally - when she and her eleven sisters and stepsisters discover a secret passageway out of their historic home on the Chesapeake Bay. At night, boys in boats and a forbidden island beckon from the shore, and Rachel and her sisters jump aboard. The night becomes Rachel s true world, and her daytime life becomes a disposable mask. Her puzzled father tries to tow his daughters back into line by enlisting the help of Paul, a med student with a seasonal job juggling at the town festival. But Paul realizes that simply blocking the girls from their midnight parties isn t going to solve the family s problems. So he embarks on a risky balancing act to gain the girls trust and to make Rachel see that splitting her life between night and light is a dangerous dance.
