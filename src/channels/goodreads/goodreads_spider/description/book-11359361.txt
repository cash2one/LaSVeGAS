11359361:::::Power, Politics, and Change: What can I do to help make the world a better place?:::::Power, Politics, and Change takes on the conventional wisdom that "power corrupts" and proposes instead that those who seek power are already corrupt: Once they attain their goal, their corruption simply has the opportunity to express itself. That's why even those who seek power in order to bring about radical change so often fail, despite their best intentions. Osho looks at where this "will to power" comes from, how it expresses itself not only in political institutions, but in our everyday relationships. In the process, he offers a vision of relationships and society based not on power over others, but on a recognition of the uniqueness of every individual. Power, Politics, and Change includes an original talk by Osho on DVD. This visual component enables the reader to experience the direct wisdom and humor of Osho straight from the source. The Osho Life Essentials series focuses on the most important questions in the life of the individual. Each volume contains timeless and always-contemporary investigations and discussions into questions vital to our personal search for meaning and purpose, focusing on questions specific to our inner life and quality of existence.
