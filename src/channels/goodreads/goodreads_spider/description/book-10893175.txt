10893175:::::Redeeming Zorus:::::Charlie s brother has put her in the no-win situation of having to rescue a cyborg from Earth Government. It s dangerous, she ll become an outlaw on Earth, but it s the only way to save her brother s life. The imprisoned cyborg is rude, conceited and probably the biggest jerk she s ever had the misfortune to meet. His only redeeming qualities are his handsome face and sexy, muscular body. Just wow! Still, she can t wait to be rid of him. All cyborgs hate humans, but Zorus is consumed by it. Chained, enslaved and facing death on Earth once again, he vows revenge. To his utter astonishment, a human female comes to his rescue. She s rude, mouthy and bossy. And very brave. She baffles him almost as much as she arouses him. Zorus cannot deny that he s fascinated by her. They are about to lock wills and ignite a firestorm of desire that defies every rule he lives by.
