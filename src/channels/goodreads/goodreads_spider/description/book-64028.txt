64028:::::Dark Celebration:::::With her erotically charged Carpathian tales, Christine Feehan has enthralled a legion of fans, captivated by a seductive world and the unforgettable characters--both human and not--who inhabit it. Now, she reunites all of them in a Dark Celebration... After centuries as the prince of the Carpathians, Mikhail Dubrinsky fears he can't protect his people for long from their greatest threat: the extinction of their species at the hands of their immortal enemies--who are devising a scheme to slaughter Carpathian females. But even with his own lifemate, Raven, and their daughter, Savannah, vulnerable to the encroaching evil, Mikhail's hope is not lost. Carpathians from around the world are gathering to join their souls and their powers to bring light to the darkness. But so too are their adversaries uniting--hunters, vampires, demons and betrayers--bringing untold dangers into the fold of the Carpathian people.
