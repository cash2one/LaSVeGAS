9412079:::::The Dance:::::Nearly a decade ago, Detective Tom Wiley worked a case that continues to haunt him to this day. But while the nature of The Puppeteer s horrific crimes will always remain in Tom s memory, it s the guilt of not catching the serial killer before he vanished that still weighs heavily on his heart. Now the eight years of peace and quiet since the vicious killing spree has come to an abrupt and gruesome end. The Puppeteer is back. With the unwanted help of his newly assigned partner, Detective Anna Perez, Tom will stop at nothing to end The Puppeteer s latest reign of terror. But as the detectives follow the trail of bodies, they quickly realize that The Puppeteer may not be their deadliest enemy, and they re up against something far more sinister than the twisted workings of a serial predator. Can Tom and Anna survive this world of insanity and death, of love and loss, of myth and magic, where the lines between good and evil are hard to discern? Or will they be forever swept away in The Dance?
