26096390:::::A Wish Made Of Glass:::::Deep in a forest glade, the fey folk dance with a young human child. Their kinship is the fabric of Isidore s childhood. But when her mother dies and her world darkens with sorrow, Isidore finds her belief in the fey folk wavering. The love of her new step-sister, Blessing, proves an unexpected gift in her time of need. Yet even as their friendship blooms, Isidore begins to see that Blessing is everything she herself has always wanted to be, but is not. Jealousy grips Isidore as she watches this beautiful new sister steal away all she holds dear. Driven to desperation, Isidore turns to the fey folk once more. She has only one wish to claim from them, one chance to make things right. But she must tread carefully. For wishes, like hearts, are easily broken. And obtaining the one thing she desires could mean destroying the one thing she truly needs.
