15885903:::::There Is No Gray in Moral Failure: A Practical Guide in Preventing Sexual and Financial Misconduct:::::In There Is No Gray In Moral Failure: A Practical Guide In Preventing Sexual and Financial Misconduct, we discuss two troublesome but seldom confronted issues in Christianity today--financial and sexual misconduct. We look at how both the clergy and Christians failure in these areas damage Christianity's image. I balance empirical and anecdotal information to present an easy-to-read and easy-to-use strategy. This is the book for you if you have found yourself, or know of a fellow Christian or minister struggling in these areas. You have the opportunity to help thwart the schemes of the devil in the people you know. The Christian walk can be difficult at times. Your pastor needs you to hold up his hands as Aaron and Hur held up Moses' hands. Your fellow Christians needs the same thing as the struggle with sin. You might need someone to hold your hands up. The book will leave you empowered and ready to stand not just for yourself but for your fellow Christian.
