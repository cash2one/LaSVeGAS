20650678:::::Unmasked: Volume Two:::::I left my former life and my mask behind. Running from a past where I was born unloved. A past where I was betrayed by love. Running from an organization with limitless power and stealth. Running for my life. I never expected to find love on the run. Not in a tiny seaside town on an island in the middle of nowhere.
