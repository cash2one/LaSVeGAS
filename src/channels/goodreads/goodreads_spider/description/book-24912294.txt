24912294:::::The Road to Somewhere far from Buxton:::::Samantha is a socially awkward over thinker at her best. So at her worst, it's safe to say she is a train wreck. When her Saint of a husband, Pete tragically passes away she is left with a responsibility. To deliver the best god damn funeral speech the world has ever heard. Putting pen to paper she has it all down. Pete deserves people to have their sock's knocked off by hearing how great he was. This guy rocked and they need to hear it. Still something is eating at her. In her fragile and grief riddled state she ponders what her choices are. After much deliberation and for reasons only Samantha knows, it's decided that it's a better idea to skip the funeral and confide in her cat. This is not the first balmy decision she has made in her life, but it certainly the most consequential. If only she had chosen A, B or C things may have been okay. But when life is a multiple choice, often Samantha ends up looking like a D.
