459746:::::Georgia on Her Mind:::::Until 10: 30 a.m., Monday, February 6, Macy Moore was Miss Most Likely To Succeed, a corporate executive on the fast track, with a marriage-material boyfriend and a cool city condo. By noon she was as good as fired...and dumped. How in the world could she go home to Beauty, Georgia, now? Thank goodness for the Single Saved Sisters. With loyal friends Lucy, Adriane and Tamara by her side, Macy retreated to the House of Joe for coffee, consolation and consultation. Could they help her put her life back on the right path?
