10331318:::::Medieval Menace:::::Starleen Maddox no longer has her nose buried in a book. There s no time. She is living her own nightmare up-close and personal. After being dumped by the man she was in love with and able to bench press two hundred fifty pounds Starleen finds herself spiraling out of control believing she could be the monster who is kidnapping and killing the men who have been disappearing at an alarming rate. The cops are not lacking in suspects, but the evidence is a whole other deal. What s the thread that links all the men together? Is that thread what drives the culprit to commit unspeakable acts? If so, why? The questions mount and the answers are fleeting. Can the police find the medieval menace before more deaths are left at their doorstep?
