1672391:::::Falling for Joshua:::::The first thing Abi saw when she opened her eyes again was Josh s face looking down at her. She could not read the expression in his eyes but she felt as if she were lying there completely naked. On the way to visit her sister in hospital, Abi drops a bag of oranges. A boy of about her own age is walking past at that moment. He bends down, picks up one of the oranges and their eyes meet. She can tell there s something special about him the moment she looks into those deep blue eyes. And when they meet again by chance in a music store a few days later, she s delighted to find that he s just as impressed by her. It s not long before Abi has her first boyfriend. Unfortunately, it s not quite as simple as that because Abi has a secret. She s not like other girls. She has epilepsy and at any moment she could fall down on the ground in a seizure. Should she tell Joshua about it? Yes, of course - but only when the time is right. Not now. Her fledgling relationship is much too fragile and precious. She can t run the risk of putting him off. Then one night the worst thing in the world happens: Abi has a seizure while they are together. Now her secret is revealed. Will Josh be able to accept her the way she is? Or will he walk away?
