13140783:::::Paint Stop Boom:::::Heroes versus heroic acts, intentions versus instincts, paintings that stop bombs, a city changing to the tick of the clock that everyone is racing against, and the nature of change. Paint Stop Boom revolves around two very different characters. Anais is an eccentric artist who unwittingly paints pieces that stop bombs. Yet she is unwilling to help stop the attacks in Sydney . She does not want to be a hero. Michael cannot comprehend how anyone would not believe in saving the world if they could. He has lost his family to a terrorist attack that exploded in the heart of Sydney and steals her paintings to stop the bombs. Anais wants her life back. All her paintings have been stolen and she is running out of time to submit her entry to the Venice Biennale. Michael is running out of time. He has stolen all her paintings and he needs more. But the police are after him for theft and Anais is refusing to paint any more. It is a story of heroes versus anti-heroes, examining the clash between those who care and those who don t; the difference between those who want to lead their lives as best they can and those who want to save the world.
