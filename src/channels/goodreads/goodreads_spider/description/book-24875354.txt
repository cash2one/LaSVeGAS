24875354:::::Pocketful of Sand:::::She s beauty for my ashes. And I m hope for her heartache. Cole Danzer. I don t know what makes a great love story. Is it that instant attraction when boy meets girl? The passionate kisses and the fairy-tale ending? Or is it a lifetime of tragedy, paid in advance, for a few stolen moments of pure bliss? The pain and the suffering that, in the end, you can say are worth it for having found the missing piece of your soul? The answer is: I don t know. I don t know what makes a great love story. I only know what makes my love story. I only know that finding Cole when I did, when Emmy and I were running from a nightmare, was the only thing that saved me. That saved us. He was more broken than I was, but somehow we took each other s shattered pieces and made a whole. If that is what makes a great love story, if that is what makes an epic romance, then mine ours is the greatest of them all. **Contains material that some may find disturbing.
