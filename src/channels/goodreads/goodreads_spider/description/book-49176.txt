49176:::::Games People Play:::::We think we're relating to other people. Actually we're all playing games. Forty years ago, Games People Play revolutionized our understanding of what really goes on during basic social interactions. More than five million copies later, Dr. Eric Berne's classic is as astonishing &amp; revealing as it was on the day it was first published. We play games all the time: sexual games, marital games, power games with our bosses, &amp; competitive games with friends. Detailing status contests like "Martini"; (I know a better way), to lethal couples combat like "If It Weren't For You"; &amp; "Uproar,"; to flirtation favorites like "The Stocking Game"; &amp; "Let's You &amp; Him Fight,"; Berne exposes the secret ploys &amp; unconscious maneuvers that rule our intimate lives. Explosive when it first appeared, Games People Play is now widely recognized as the most original &amp; influential popular psychology book of our time. It's as powerful &amp; eye-opening as ever.
