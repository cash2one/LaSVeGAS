16156295:::::The Last Kiss Goodbye:::::Dr. Charlotte Charlie Stone has dedicated her career as a psychiatrist to exploring the darkest territory of all: the hearts and minds of serial killers. It s a job she s uniquely suited for, thanks to the secret talent that gives her an uncanny edge Charlie can see dead people, whose tormented spirits cry out to her for the justice only she can provide. This blessing or curse gives Charlie the power to hunt down and catch madmen and murderers. It s also turned her love life upside down by drawing her into a hopelessly passionate relationship with the lingering ghost of charismatic bad boy Michael Garland. But there s little time for romance with her supernatural suitor when murder comes pounding at Charlie s door in the form of a terrified young woman fleeing a homicidal maniac. Saving her life places Charlie squarely in the cross-hairs of a sadistic predator nicknamed the Gingerbread Man, notorious for manipulating his victims like pawns in a deadly chess game. And now the queen this psychopath s bent on capturing is Charlie. Refusal to play will only put more innocent lives in danger. Matching wits with this cunningly twisted opponent will require all of Charlie s training and expert skills. But even with her devilish guardian angel not to mention her favorite flesh-and-blood Fed, Tony Bartoli watching her beautiful back, the Gingerbread Man s horrifying grin might be the last thing Charlie ever sees.
