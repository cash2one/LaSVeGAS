637160:::::The Holy Road:::::An unforgettable American story, Dances With Wolves was an international bestseller that has become a modern classic. The 1990 film adaptation won seven Academy Awards. In The Holy Road, master storyteller Michael Blake at long last continues the saga. Eleven years have passed since Lieutenant John Dunbar became the Comanche warrior Dances With Wolves and married Stands With A Fist, a white-born woman raised as a Comanche from early childhood. With their three children, they live peacefully in the village of Ten Bears. But there is unease in the air, caused by increased reports of violent confrontations with white soldiers, who want to drive the Comanche onto reservations. Disquiet turns to horror, and then to rage, when a band of white rangers descend on Ten Bears' village, slaughtering half its inhabitants and abducting Stands With A Fist and her infant daughter. The three surviving great warriors--Wind In His Hair, Kicking Bird, and Dances With Wolves--decide they must go to war with the white invaders. At the same time, Dances With Wolves realizes that only he can rescue his wife and child. Told with the same sweep, insight, and majesty that have made Dances With Wolves a worldwide phenomenon, The Holy Road is an epic story of courage and honor.
