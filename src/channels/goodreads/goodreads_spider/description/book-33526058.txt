33526058:::::Twisted in You:::::It's not the sins her eyes have seen, but the sins her body has felt. Mikayla Depressed, crazy, violent, angry, suicidal. Those are the adjectives most people would use to describe me. Ironically, the one that upsets me is violent. I m not a violent person. Am I depressed? Yes. Life s a bitch, and she s taken me for a fucking ride. Crazy? I wouldn t say so, although I can see why people would describe me as such. Angry? Fuck yeah. I ve got some twisted stories to explain my anger. Suicidal? Well, maybe this one time. And that one time is the reason I m here, telling you my story, from room 113 of the Chasing Freedom Recovery Center. Isn t the name fucking peachy? Sit tight folks, you re in for a dark ride. Tyler I don t have a problem. Drinking is something I do to relax after a long day of work, or a long day on stage. I m not an alcoholic. I know what alcoholics are like, and that s not me. (Not yet.) Regardless, they send me to Chasing Freedom. (Again). They re determined to heal something that isn t broken. (Liar.) And I m stuck with Red, hearing her lose her shit and tell me off in the process. However, one look into her eyes shows me her demons. Some I am familiar with, others I can t fathom. I know darkness, but she s pitch black, and I want to hold the torch and lead her out. Author's Note: While it is not necessary to read Red Lights, Black Hearts before Twisted in You, this novel contains some minor spoilers.
