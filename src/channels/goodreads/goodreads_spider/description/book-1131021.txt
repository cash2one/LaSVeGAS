1131021:::::The Mill on the Floss:::::The Mill on the Floss , based on George Eliot's own experiences of provincial life, is a masterpiece of ambiguity in which moral choice is subjected to the hypocrisy of the Victorian age. As the headstrong Maggie Tulliver grows into womanhood, the deep love which she has for her brother Tom turns into conflict, because she can not reconcile his bourgeois standards with her own lively intelligence. She is unable to adapt to or break free from her community, and tragedy, on more than one level, is the result.
