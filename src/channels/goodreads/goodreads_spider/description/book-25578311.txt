25578311:::::Ensnared by Destiny:::::One of the most coveted criminals in the entire kingdom of Aragon has invaded Mardon, the very same town Cordelia has made her home since she abdicated her throne. He steals from the townsfolk, stalks Cordelia, and effortlessly incapacitates guards, all to deliver a message: Cordelia s best friend Liam will die. Cordelia must save Liam, but her only ally is the same man who proclaimed Liam s demise. A man whose power nullifies her own. Armed with only her wit and a streak of stubbornness that has been more detrimental than helpful in the past at her disposal, Cordelia will have to outsmart, bribe, and deceive all who bar her way if she is to have any chance of rescuing Liam. It s a battle against destiny, and someone must be sacrificed.
