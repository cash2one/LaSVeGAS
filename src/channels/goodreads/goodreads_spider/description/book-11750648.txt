11750648:::::Spy School:::::Can a normal, average kid become a superstar secret agent? Maybe not, but it ll be fun to watch him try! Ben Ripley may only be in middle school, but he s already pegged his dream job: C.I.A. or bust. Unfortunately for him, his personality doesn t exactly scream secret agent. In fact, Ben is so awkward, he can barely get to school and back without a mishap. Because of his innate math skills, Ben isn't surprised when he is recruited for a magnet school with a focus on science but he s entirely shocked to discover that the school is actually a front for a junior C.I.A. academy. Could the C.I.A. really want him ? Actually, no. There s been a case of mistaken identity but that doesn t stop Ben from trying to morph into a supercool undercover agent, the kind that always gets the girl. And through a series of hilarious misadventures, Ben realizes he might actually be a halfway decent spy if he can survive all the attempts being made on his life!
