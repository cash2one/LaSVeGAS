709835:::::A Texan's Luck:::::Captain Walker Larson received the shock of his life when a beautiful stranger boldly walked into his office claiming to be his wife. His father may have bought Lacy Larson for him in a wife lottery, but Walker had no desire for a bride even one as captivating as the one standing before him. So he promptly sent Lacy back to Cedar Point. Nearly three years later, Lacy is shocked when Walker shows up on her doorstep ordered by the military to protect his wife from a killer. Lacy wants nothing to do with the gruff soldier who once drove her away. But despite their different lifestyles and expectations, she finds herself wondering if their marriage was a far better gamble than either of them had imagined...and what it would feel like to be in his arms.
