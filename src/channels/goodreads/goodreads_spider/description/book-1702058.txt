1702058:::::Never Leave Me:::::An exquisite woman, Lisette de Valmy had grown up lonely but hauntingly beautiful. Daughter of a great chateau, she had dedicated herself to the desperate and dangerous French Resistance. When the Germans advanced on her beloved village, led by Major Dieter Meyer, she knew what she was sworn to do--but felt the same fierce struggle that raged over Europe burning in her own heart. Was the surrender she was powerless to deny one of hate, or forbidden love? Listette had been wounded by the war, a deep and silent hurt that would never leave her. But when the handsome American Officer asked her to marry him, the flame that still burned within her responded to his embrace, and to the new life that beckoned a world away from all she knew. Starting over meant abandoning her past, but memories that wouldn't die pursued her--and finally brought her face to face with her long hidden secrets and a love that could never die. Lisette's story takes her from the dark and terrible days of Occupation through the glory of liberation, and then on a triumphant and stirring journey of the heart.
