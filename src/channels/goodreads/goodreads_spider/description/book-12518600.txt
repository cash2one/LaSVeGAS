All Jack Torrence wanted in 1965 was to be as successful as Steven Duke, the leading horror fiction writer in the world. But how did Duke come up with those bestselling plots? Torrence learns the answer is that Duke conjured the demon Legion and allowed himself to be possessed when he was writing at his cabin in Burlington, Vermont. Legion is stronger now and Duke is weaker. Soon, the demon will take over the author's mind, body and soul. Torrence, who contacts the author, might be Duke's only chance at salvation. Is there enough time? And, how does Torrence end up as America's bestselling author locked away in a mental institution in 1985?
