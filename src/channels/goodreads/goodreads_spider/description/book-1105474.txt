1105474:::::That Printer of Udell's:::::"Decidedly interesting"--The New York Times "(A) thoroughly good novel"--The Boston Globe Dick Falkner's childhood consisted of poverty and abuse from an alcoholic father. Recognizing his life for what it was, he ran away from his home, but he could not run away from all of his problems. Sixteen years later he found himself hungry of body and empty of spirit in a small Midwestern town. He was determined to make something of himself and to not be controlled by alcohol. Initially, he finds no help in this so-called Christian town. Eventually, he is taken in by George Udell, a local publisher and a kind-hearted man. George Udell gives the young man a job, and something more important: spiritual support. Through hard work and Christian morals, the man who becomes known as "that printer of Udell's" rises above his past to a new life with God, inspiring those around him along the way. As in Wright's The Shepherd of the Hills and The Calling of Dan Matthews, both also published by Pelican, good deeds and a strong belief in God form the basis for a happy life, no matter what the past.
