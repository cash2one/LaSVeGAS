13553426:::::The Story of Mimi and Simi:::::From School Library Journal Kindergarten-Grade 2The Story of Mimmy and Simmy could easily be subtitled The Grass Is Always Greener . . . . Mimmy is a wealthy child with many material possessions. Simmy lives in a "rumpledown" house with many brothers and sisters, much work to do and few dresses or dolls. They are both unhappy and jealous of each other. In classic "Prince and the Pauper" fashion, they trade places for one day. Predictably Simmy soon tires of trying on new clothes and playing alone. Mimmy discovers that having lots of siblings can mean not having privacy, free time or new toys. The girls learn to be satisfied with what they have. Adequate pink and yellow illustrations appear on all but one page. The presence of unexplained Hebrew words such as abba, imma and Sukkos make this book most appropriate for Hebrew school libraries.
