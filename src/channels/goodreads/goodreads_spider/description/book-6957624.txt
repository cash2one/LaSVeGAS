To stop them, he partners with Olivia, a flame-haired Therian temptress as strong as she is beautiful. But Olivia is no ordinary immortal. The survivor of a vicious supernatural attack, she possesses a deadly and forbidden skill one that must remain hidden, especially from the powerful Feral Warriors.

And the only one who can save her soul is the arrogant jaguar shifter she lusts for but dares not love.
