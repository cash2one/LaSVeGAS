18104566:::::Midsummer's Magic:::::Bloody hell! Someone save me from piskies and meddling best friends." Beth is always running from love, life, and relationships. She doesn't want to be tied down and she always follows the motto Find em, fuck em, and forget em. So when Beth finds herself running away again from another man, she chooses the darkest part of Cornwall to start a new life. But then she meets her neighbor. Liam is young, handsome, and a bona fide bachelor. He used to take great pleasure in the sun, beautiful waves, and sex life he seemed to easily find living in Cornwall... until tragedy struck and he lost everyone he cared about. Now he devotes his days in keeping his family's farm, and shuts himself away from society and his old life. If not for some confusing property lines, a car blocking the way, and a tractor in need of a clear path, Beth and Liam would not have met. But will serendipity, a couple of pixies, and an age-old prophecy be enough to get these two lost souls together? Or will they need more than just a pinch of Cornish magic?
