1561323:::::Through the Windshield:::::Mike DeCapite's Through the Windshield is a journey to the end of the night in a '74 LeSabre. What began in 1985 as a single page of notes for a book about a year in the life of a down-and-out cab driver became, five years later, this tour de force novel, full of characters, weather, talk, illuminations, laughter full of life. Widely circulated in manuscript and excerpted in little magazines, the book already had a reputation by the time it was published in the original Sparkle Street edition of 1998. Now, Red Giant returns this intimate epic to print. "Read it for its humor. Read it for its pain. Or read it for its language, a hard-boiled version of Beat expansiveness. One thing's certain: with all the different and sometimes contradictory things that this book accomplishes, you'll never read anything else like it." Frank Green, The Cleveland Free Times "One of the better American novels published in the last several years . . ." Harvey Pekar, The Austin Chronicle "A novel of undeniable and unusual merit, DeCapite's achievement is so extraordinary that a belated appreciation must be penned in the hope it will cause at least one other person to pick up this book. . . . [A] down-at-the-heels masterpiece." Jocko Weyland, Rain Taxi
