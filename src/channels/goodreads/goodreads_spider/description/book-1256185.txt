1256185:::::The House Of Thirty Cats:::::Sarah liked to think of Miss Tabitha Henshaw's house as "almost an enchanted place." With her thirty cats, there was no better place to visit if you wanted just the right kitten. Soon Sarah and the old lady become friends, and Sarah also gets to know each of the cats' personalities. But when an angry neighbor complains to the town council, they tell Miss Tabitha the cats must go. Then Sarah has an idea: if she can match cats with people, perhaps she can find all her feline friends new homes.
