20567178:::::And the Music Plays On:::::Miss Margaret, a matriarchal figure in a southern, small town church, is set in her ways and staunchly opposes change. Miss Margaret has been the Methodist church organist for almost 40 years and she truly loves the pipe organ she plays. In addition to valuing the tangible instrument, there is a deeper, more ethereal component to this situation. Miss Margaret uses the organ as a means of expression, one in which she pours her heart and soul into. After so many years of joined experience, she feels the organ actually contains a piece of her. Playing the old pipe organ has been a consistent source of joy the entire time she s been the organist. Her beloved church has fallen into disrepair from years of haphazard neglect and a sect in the church advocates reconstruction using state of the art materials and technology. A rift forms between the church members who want to repair the church to its original state and the progressive sect who want to modernize as renovations take place. Decisions reach a crescendo when it is discovered that Miss Margaret s cherished pipe organ needs complete restoration. It appears that progressive attitudes will prevail over the traditional frame of reference that the people in the town have historically lived by. Miss Margaret becomes painfully aware that times have changed while she seems to have been standing still. Will Miss Margaret carve a place for herself in a new modern church setting or will she oppose change and the possibility that time will march forward without her?
