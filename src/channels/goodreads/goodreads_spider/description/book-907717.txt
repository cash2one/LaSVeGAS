Fairchild and Hayward counsel parents how to respond supportively to gay children and focus on bringing families together and maintaining the bonds of acceptance and affirmation. They inform parents on the pressing hearth and emotional issues that affect the gay and lesbian communities today -- an entire chapter, updated for this edition, is devoted to AIDS as weir as a chapter on gays and religion and the concept of gay/lesbian marriages. And it directs parents toward the support that they need to navigate these previously unknown waters.The winner of the Gay Book Award of the American Library Association Gay Task Force, the book and its authors were praised by the Advocate for succeeding in bringing parents and whole families "from the first moments of revelation through the guilt and recrimination, emerging on the other side of tolerance in love and joy."
