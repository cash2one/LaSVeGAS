6098211:::::Memoirs of a Midget:::::Miss M., a pretty and diminutive young woman with a passion for shells, fossils, flints, butterflies and stuffed animals, struggles to deal with her isolation from the rest of society due to her size. She tells of her early life and her tempestuous twentieth year in which she witnesses death, infatuation, suicide and madness. An elegiac, misanthropic, sometimes perverse study of isolation, de la Mare's prize-winning classic is a dark and teasing riddle that seduces by its gentle charm and elegant prose. Walter de la Mare (1873 1956) was born of a Scottish mother and a father descended from an old Huguenot family. He was educated at St Paul's Cathedral Choir School, which he left at sixteen to work in the City Office of the Anglo-American Oil Company, writing in his spare time under the pseudonym Walter Ramal. He left after nine years to devote his life to letters. His collected poems were published in 1942. His major works include the children's novel The Three Royal Monkeys and the long poem The Traveller . He was the recipient of much praise and many honours, including the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for Memoirs of a Midget .
