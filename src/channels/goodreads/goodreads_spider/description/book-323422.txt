323422:::::A Season to Be Sinful:::::Alexander Grantham, Viscount Sheridan, is stunned to find three young boys at his door, demanding he right the wrongs of an incident that occurred earlier that evening when he thwarted a determined thief. When he discovers his wily pickpocket is a woman, now gravely injured, he takes his flame-haired attacker under his wing. Clearly, Sheridan's new "guest" is a lady of quality. So how did she become a common street thief? He finds himself irresistibly drawn to the clever, cheeky Lily, and determined to unlock her mysteries. The five years since she left the care of the French convent have been a nightmare for Lily. Her secrets are dangerous as is the powerful man determined to find her. The handsome Viscount is clearly a gentleman with secrets of his own, but staying with him could mean the difference between life and death for Lily. With each passing day, her handsome host turns Lily's convalescence into an increasingly sensual escape. Now her greatest challenge may be imagining anything less than a future in his arms.
