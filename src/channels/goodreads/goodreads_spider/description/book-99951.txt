99951:::::Objectivism: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand:::::THE 25TH ANNIVERSARY EDITION The definitive statement of Ayn Rand s philosophy as interpreted by her best student and chosen heir. This brilliantly conceived and organized book is Dr. Leonard Peikoff s classic text on the abstract principles and practical applications of Objectivism, based on his lecture series The Philosophy of Objectivism. Ayn Rand said of these lectures: Until or unless I write a comprehensive treatise on my philosophy, Dr. Peikoff s course is the only authorized presentation of the entire theoretical structure of Objectivism that is, the only one that I know of my knowledge to be fully accurate. In Objectivism , Peikoff covers every philosophic topic that Rand regarded as important from certainty to money, from logic to art, from measurement to sex. Drawn from Rand s published works as well as in-depth conversations between her and Peikoff, these chapters illuminate Objectivism and its creator with startling clarity. With Objectivism, the millions of readers who have been transformed by Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead will discover the full philosophical system underlying Ayn Rand s work .
