18073066:::::Get Bent:::::Naomi Knox is missing. I don't even f*cking know whether she's dead or alive. What I do know is that she's the air I need to breathe. She's my redemption, an all consuming fire that burns in my blood. And I'll do anything to find her. Anything. Even if it means the end for me. &amp; &amp; &amp; Turner Campbell is searching. But he has no f*cking clue what it is he's searching for. There's darkness all around and enough secrets to choke. There are angels, and there are devils. It's impossible to tell them apart. Light needs to be shone on the truth, but there's no one left to hold the torch. The line between life and death is blurred, and the players are all thoroughly entrenched in the game. The question is: am I still one of them?
