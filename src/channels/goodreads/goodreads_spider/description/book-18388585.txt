When Lydia is ordered to leave the haven of the Louisiana plantation known as La Nouvelle Vie, she thinks she is free from the twisted desires of her dark trinity. Yet as she struggles with the question of whether or not she even wants to be free, Lydia finds herself again submitting to the depraved demands of the obsessive Preston Severine. AS IN THE EROTIC DARK, THIS BOOK CONTAINS GRAPHIC SCENES OF SPANKING, CANING, DUBIOUS CONSENT, ENFORCED SUBMISSION, AND EXPLICIT SEX. Read only if these themes do not offend you!
