Tag along as Stella and Pin Pin ditch Little Italy for midtown Manhattan, all the while battling archrival Angie Como for the title to SOHO s Annual Food Drive, their ticket to Regis Academy a posh high school for girls, hidden far, far away in the Catskills. Oh-la-la, for the chance to leave home for good! Problem is... the road isn t much safer than home, especially when the runaways attract the attention of police, museum officials and worst of all Stella s unforgiving father. Also pitted against their extravagant dreams is the threat of Pin and her family s deportation, including baby sister, Audrey, who lies at the heart of this quirky coming-of-age novel STELLA BELLAROSA, a serious MG with a funny-bone.
