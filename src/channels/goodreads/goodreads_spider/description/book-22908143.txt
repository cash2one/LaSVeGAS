22908143:::::Sleepless Nights:::::I ve been living two lives for the past seven years. One with Victor and the other with Damien. Victor I ve known all my life. When his parents died he even came to live with my family and I. I was so in love with him. It wasn t until years into our relationship I started to see the faults in him. Then he went off to Iraq. Damien was the bad boy biker at our high school. Even while I was with Victor, I couldn t keep my eyes off of him. Then I got on the back of his bike and I thought I finally found my home. Then Victor came back wounded. That was all five years ago and now those two lives and my two loves are starting to converge. I don t know who I am anymore and I don t know who I want to be with. Though these two guys won t let me be single for long. But one of them has gotten me into a lot of trouble with the mob. And now it s up to the other one to save me. And before you roll your eyes, that statement isn t what you think. You ll be surprised who the bad guy really is. I promise to find my happily ever after, even if it s at the Wrath MC clubhouse in the arms of an alpha biker or in the high society world where I was born and in the arms of my ex-army man. Ashley Southerland was here.
