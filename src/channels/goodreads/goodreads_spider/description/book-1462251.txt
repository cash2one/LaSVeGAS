1462251:::::A Roller Coaster for the Twins!:::::THE JESSICA AND ELIZABETH FANTASY FUN PARK! Jessica and Elizabeth have something awesome in their backyard - their very own roller coaster! It was a surprise gift from their new friend Billy. Jessica and Elizabeth love riding the new roller coaster, the Wakester, and they invite all their friends at school to come ride it too. But the twins didn't expect everyone at Sweet Valley Elementary School to show up! Soon the Wakefields' backyard is out of control. And Jessica and Elizabeth are beginning to wonder - do their friends like them ... or just their roller coaster?
