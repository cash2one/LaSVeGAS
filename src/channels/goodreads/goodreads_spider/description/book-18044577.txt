18044577:::::Heir of the Wings:::::My life has turned upside down. Chris has told me things I can t even imagine possible like my parents are not my real parents. I am a princess of fairies with a powerful evil fairy, Savannah Queensley, trying to kill me. Now I must travel to fairy world, kill Savannah, and take back the crown! But wait... I found out Savannah s sister, Chloe, is destroying the outer kingdoms. A whole new challenge will take place as I gather witches, elves, and whoever will join my army to take back the kingdom! I just hope I live to see the day!
