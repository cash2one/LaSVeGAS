82104:::::How I Found Freedom in an Unfree World: A Handbook for Personal Liberty:::::In 1973 Harry Browne sent a simple message -- that you can live the life you want to live. 40 years after the publication of How I Found Freedom in an Unfree World, it is now being reissued in digital format -- to reach the millions of people around the world that are still seeking a point of view that is as refreshing, and liberating as it was when it first appeared on the scene. From the book: Freedom is the opportunity to live your life as you want to live it. And that is possible, even if others remain as they are. If you re not free now, it might be because you ve been preoccupied with the people or institutions that you feel have restrained your freedom. I don t expect you to stop worrying about them merely because I suggest that you do. I do hope to show you, though, that those people and institutions are relatively powerless to stop you once you decide how you will achieve your freedom. There are things you can do to be free, and if you turn your attention to those things, no one will stand in your way. But when you become preoccupied with those who are blocking you, you overlook the many alternatives you could use to bypass them. The freedom you seek is already available to you, but it has gone unnoticed. There probably are two basic reasons you haven t taken advantage of that freedom. One reason is that you re unaware of the many alternatives available to you.
