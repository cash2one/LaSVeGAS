383357:::::The Exemplary Husband: A Biblical Perspective:::::God ordained marriage between a man and a woman for companionship, procreation, and so man would have a helper suitable. However, God says much more in the Bible about husbands loving their wives than He says about wives submitting to their husbands. He created marriage to be a picture of the relationship between Christ and the Church. Christ was willing to sacrifice His life for the Church, and God expects no less from husbands today. The overall purpose of The Exemplary Husband is to assist husbands toward purposeful and lasting Christlikeness for the glory of God. It was written to be a companion book for The Excellent Wife by Martha Peace. Couples who commit to the biblical principles presented in these books will find a oneness in marriage that will give God glory and bring His blessing.
