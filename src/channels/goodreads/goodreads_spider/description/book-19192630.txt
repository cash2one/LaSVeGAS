19192630:::::Divergent Parody: Detergent:::::From Amazon's best-selling parody author, Reid Mockery, comes Detergent. Beverly Cryer (Vurl) has to choose a dystopian faction to live with for the rest of her life. If she doesn't make it through initiation, she'll be factionless and declared a Detergent. But, Vurl is determined not to spend the rest of her life doing everyone else's laundry. She is an independent young woman with skills she doesn't even know about and with the help of handsome number Two she'll not only make it through initiation, she'll save the city from disaster. Okay, that's the serious book pitch. This is a book that makes fun of Divergent. It's a parody, so it follows the same basic story but is more outrageous, silly, stupid and all the other things that make a great parody great. Mockery has a proven track record delivering laughs and this one doesn't disappoint. If you loved Divergent, try Detergent!
