6757966:::::Haunting Jordan:::::RITA-nominated author P. J. Alderman weaves present-day supernatural sleuthery with nineteenth-century intrigue in the first book of an enchanting new mystery series set in picturesque Port Chatham, Washington. Jordan Marsh left L.A. for the quaint Pacific Northwest town of Port Chatham in pursuit of some much-needed R &amp; R. As the prime suspect in her cheating husband s murder, she had been hoping to immerse herself in the restoration of the charming Victorian she d just bought and put all talk of homicide investigations behind her. But as she soon discovers, the coldest of cases cry out to be solved, too. For this old house comes fully furnished with two garrulous ghosts who have a century-old murder of their own they d like her to look into. Now, if Jordan can keep the L.A. police at bay, and sort through a suspect list of shady characters circa 1890, she might just clear a wrongly accused man s name and her own.
