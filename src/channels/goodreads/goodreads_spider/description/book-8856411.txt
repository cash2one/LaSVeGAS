8856411:::::Shadow Mist:::::Some people prefer shadow to substance and reject truth for a lie. Welcome to Shadow Mist: a carnival ride of evil that runs a gantlet of violence from Long Island's posh suburbs to the mean streets of 1970's New York City. Burke lives in a world that offers advantages few people are fortunate to have. It is a world he detests. He charges through life without mercy or pity, and from one unforeseen catastrophe to another, with an appetite for trouble that is never satiated - - despite a two-timing fianc, a ragged pack of violent enemies, and two New York City detectives that suspect him in a rash of brutal rapes. Based on a true story.
