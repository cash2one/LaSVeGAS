95377:::::Permanent Midnight:::::His byline appeared everywhere, from L.A. Style to the Village Voice , from Esquire to Hustler . He penned scripts for twisted cult classics like Cafe Flesh and Dr. Caligari . He banged out shows for TV mega-hits like Moonlighting , Twin Peaks , and thirtysomething . But even when Jerry Stahl was making five grand a week, he was shooting six. Careening from his luxury home to L.A.'s more hellacious neighborhoods, he financed a heroin habit that brought on the soothing hiss of oblivion, while it stole his health and smashed his career. Until in a private apocalypse straight out of Day of the Locust , Jerry Stahl kicked smack and emerged clean. A searing, strung-out confessional in the lineage of Lenny Bruce, William S. Burroughs, and Hubert Selby Jr., PERMANENT MIDNIGHT chronicles one man's slide into the opiated abyss and his claw-marked ascent back into the light--heralding the return of the Urban Hipster to contemporary literature, infused with savage humor and relentless intensity.
