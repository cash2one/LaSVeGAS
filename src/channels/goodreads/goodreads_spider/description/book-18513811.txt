18513811:::::Rizq And Lawful Earnings:::::Narrated by Umar Ibn al-Khattaab (May Allah be pleased with him), the Prophet (Peace be upon him) said: If you put your faith completely in Allah, He will arrange for your sustenance in the same way as he provides for the bird. They go out in the morning with their stomachs empty and return filled in the evening. (Tirmidhee) This book discusses the place of pride Islam gives to making lawful earnings and rizq through hard work and striving. It also looks at the contempt Islam places on begging and indolence. Then it looks at which earnings are lawful, which are not and the many ways by which wealth can increase while seeking the pleasure of Allah (Glorified and Exalted is He).
