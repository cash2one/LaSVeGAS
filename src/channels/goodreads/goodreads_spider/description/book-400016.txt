400016:::::Unforgettable:::::Having a roommate at elite Waverly Academy means nightly sleepovers and double the designer wardrobe. But Callie Vernon never really liked late-night girl talk or swapping cashmere sweaters with her younger, rosy-cheeked roomie, Jenny Humphrey. So when Jenny stole her longtime boyfriend, Easy Walsh, Callie didn't feel that guilty about turning right around and kissing him behind Jenny's back. Okay, maybe a little guilty, but it certainly didn't stop her from enjoying it. Now, if only Easy would stop being so irritatingly indecisive and dump Jenny already! While the two roommates are sharing a boyfriend, the rest of Dumbarton's residents are sharing their feelings at the newly founded Women of Waverly club--aka, WOW! Everyone is totally bonding, revealing their most personal secrets, and hugging out their past rivalries. But despite the sharing-is-caring vibe, there are some things these girls aren't spilling--like who's making special late-night trips to the crater . . . and with whom. Now it's only a matter of time before all the newfound girl power explodes into a massive girl fight. But this battle goes well beyond the ivy colored brick walls of Dumberton--it's about who will be Waverly's next It Girl.
