253305:::::Animal Farm:::::George Orwell s 1945 satire on the perils of Stalinism has proved magnificently long-lived as a parable about totalitarianism anywhere and has given the world at least one immortal phrase: Everyone is equal, but some are more equal than others. This new dramatization sticks very closely to the book, and the production has toured all over England, Scotland, Wales and Romania in Orwell s centenary year. Dare I say it . . . as good as the book. Guardian
