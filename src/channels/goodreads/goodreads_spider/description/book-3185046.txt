3185046:::::A Conquering Faith: Doctrinal Foundations for Christian Reformation:::::This monograph takes on the doctrinal defections of today's church by providing Christians with an introductory treatment of six vital areas of Christian doctrine. The Biblical teaching concerning God's sovereignty, Christ's lordship in the gospel, the authority of God's law, the self-authenticating truths of God's existence and the inspiratin and authority of Scripture, the dominion mandate, and the triumph of Christ and His church in history are necessary antidotes to the man-centered theology plaguing the Church at the beginning of the 21st century.
