5700:::::The Adolescent:::::The narrator and protagonist of Dostoevsky s novel The Adolescent (first published in English as A Raw Youth ) is Arkady Dolgoruky, a naive 19-year-old boy bursting with ambition and opinions. The illegitimate son of a dissipated landowner, he is torn between his desire to expose his father s wrongdoing and the desire to win his love. He travels to St. Petersburg to confront the father he barely knows, inspired by an inchoate dream of communion and armed with a mysterious document that he believes gives him power over others. This new English version by the most acclaimed of Dostoevsky s translators is a masterpiece of pathos and high comedy.
