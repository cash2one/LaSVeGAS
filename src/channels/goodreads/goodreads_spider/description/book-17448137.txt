17448137:::::Fighting for You:::::Ella Webber has spent years uncomfortable around the opposite sex... But as soon as she meets handsome Declan Stone, she is smitten. Quickly they become friends, finding frequent reasons to see each other around the office, and Ella longs for even more. So-with a little help from her friends-Ella resorts to performing a little seduction. One that Declan will never be able to resist. Burdened by emotional baggage from his time in the army, Declan refuses to believe he's the right man for sweet Ella. Even if she makes him long for normal things, like marriage and family....But in his attempts to close off his heart from her love, could he have underestimated Ella's powers of persuasion? ----- "The fourth book in the Danvers series, Fighting For You, featuring Declan and Ella will release in the US in e-book form on 10/15/2013! I assume that the release date outside of the US will be as it was on previous books, 90 days after the US release so that would be 1/15/2014. I am also told that the paperback version will release in February 2014. I m so excited! This is probably my favorite book of the series so far and I just know that you will love it too. I hope to release the first chapter soon!" From Authors site: http://sydneylandon.com/
