Once, she actually tried to end it all, but failed miserably. Since then, she has been struggling to keep a promise she made to her parents... one that she has regretted making ever since. One day though, she sees news about a killer on the loose, who appears to be targeting girls around her age. Then an idea pops in her head: What if I could end it all? Why does an innocent girl have to lose her life when she doesn t want to? When I am stuck here living a life that I don t want to live. So she decides to go on the hunt, find the predator, and offer herself as a willing prey. But is she going to get what she wants, or is she going to get more than she bargained for?
