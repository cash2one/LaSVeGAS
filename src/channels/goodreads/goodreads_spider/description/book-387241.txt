387241:::::Winnie The Pooh: And The House At Pooh Corner:::::Here's where Pooh's adventures all began. Published in 1926, this is the original Winnie-the-Pooh with illustrations by Ernest H. Shepard. Beginning with "Winnie-the-Pooh and Some Bees," here are ten classic tales featuring the whole gang: Pooh, Piglet, Rabbit, Eeyore, Owl, Kanga, Little Roo, and Christopher Robin. Rmember when Pooh visits Rabbit and "gets into a tight place" as he attempts to enter Rabbit's house? Remember Eeyore's very eventful birthday party? Piglet's water-filled rescue? The beloved stories are all here, as A.A. Milne wrote them more than 70 years ago.
