19615646:::::Sophie: Dog Overboard:::::As Jan and Dave Griffith motored out of Mackay Marina on their boat, Honey May, it was just another day in paradise. A weekend's sailing around the islands with Sophie, their blue cattle dog, and then home. But out at sea, the unthinkable happened. Sophie disappeared overboard and despite Jan and Dave's frantic search efforts, their beloved family pet was presumed lost at sea. For Jan and Dave it was hard to imagine ever getting over her loss. What followed is a truly extraordinary story of survival, luck and loyalty. The bonds between animals and humans are mysteriously strong and, in this case, a canine Robinson Crusoe was determined to beat the odds to return to her family - she was never going to be anyone's dog but theirs!
