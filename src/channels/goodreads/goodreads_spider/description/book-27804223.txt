The Excellence Habit is a reminder that you are the owner of your success. There are no magic formulas, shortcuts, or secret sauce. The 7-rules, or 3 steps, or 12 laws that promise to change your life - they won t help, unless you do the work. You will learn from many, yet the most important steps, you need to take on your own. Over the course of your adult life it is always you, who has the most power. You will not always be in control and nobody is. But you can choose to maximize your effect on this planet, on your loved ones and on your personal fulfillment by building an Excellence Habit. The Excellence Habit also examines the distinction between success and excellence. Success is achieving high goals. Excellence is doing the right thing, even when not driving towards any goal. It is a small mindset shift, which will produce big results. Excellence can and will lead to success. Success, on the other hand, can be the biggest enemy of excellence. More often than not success is measured in social influence, recognition and wealth. For those practicing it faithfully - excellence is its own biggest reward.
