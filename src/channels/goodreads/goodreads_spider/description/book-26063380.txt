This courageous tale of perseverance in the face of adversity is a timeless rendering of the never ending quest for transformation and beauty. Bianca Lakoseljac, author of Summer of the Dancing Bear With Calls Across the Pacific, Zo Roy continues to plumb her firsthand knowledge of everyday life in Maoist China. Her experience of this endlessly fascinating era, combined with a talent for detailed, humorous and sometimes heartbreaking storytelling, makes for a fine novel which delights and informs in equal measure. Roy captures the culture shock that assaults her protagonist Nina Huang, and shows how her birth culture never quite lets go, despite ownership of the iconic American passport.
