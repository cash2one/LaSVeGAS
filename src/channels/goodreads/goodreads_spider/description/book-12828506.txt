12828506:::::Image:::::There is an ominous darkness; one that is so dense and mind-numbing that you can feel the chills race across your skin as the energy of its hatred hovers near you. They thought that it was over that he was dead they never imagined that he was more powerful dead than he ever was alive. The dark dimension Esterious is on the brink of war, the victory Willow had a few days ago is nothing more than a vague memory. With each thought she has, she fights the images of Drake s dark eyes and his words his promises. Doubt seeps into her soul as she faces what could be the hardest battle she has faced so far. Venus is meant to be the planet of love and peace but when it falls into retrograde its influence changes. Matters of past relationships will surface, choices will be made with the mind and not the heart and gateways to an evil that cannot be fathomed will open. Willow and Landen s only defense is to hide their family away, and lock themselves in the palace that was once ruled by Donalt. The energy is heavy and dark within its walls there is a presence that lingers and strikes at will. Cruel illusions are placed before Willow, but that is not even the hardest part what is hard is standing in a room with Drake and Landen and listening to others tell you of lives that you cannot recall for them to tell you when and how you are going to die. Every prediction and theory is about to be proven wrong and the choice before Willow s heart holds the lives of millions at stake. The question is: will she be able to see through the illusions before her and make a choice she can live with?
