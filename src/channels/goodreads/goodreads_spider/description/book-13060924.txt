13060924:::::Karma's a Bitch:::::Karma's a Bitch by J.Gail If you think you can do somebody dirty and get away with it, just because you didn't get caught, you're dead wrong. All of that dirt comes back to you one way or another. Tony Jackson learns this lesson the hard way. Labeled the "asshole of West Philly," Tony holds no shame in having other women in his girlfriend Quanisha's bed. There is little remorse after he knocks off a convenience store and beats the cashier with a gun. He'll rob from his girl, his friends, people he doesn't know and your mama. Whoever, he doesn't care. And we all know that when you get money wrong, you can't hold onto it for nothing! The question is when will Tony figure that out? Maybe when he starts getting his Karma instantly and mercilessly he'll get the hint. In fact, when will Tony get the big picture? That there's no future in his game. Will a dose of `Instant Karma' show him that not contributing to society in any positive way is guaranteed to get him a one way ticket to no where?
