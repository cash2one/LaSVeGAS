21803375:::::A Broken Beautiful Beginning:::::Can t live without you... I don t want to be alone in the dark Jace s last words play in my head over and over as I lay in this dark trunk. I can hear his faint mumbling through the insulation of the backseat. I cry louder, asking for him to pull over, to let me out. Praying for him to take me back to my baby girl. Hitting my fists against the top of the trunk I scream and yell, but nothing He continues to drive further and further away from my family. I have just found my way back to Caleb. We are supposed to be a family. I need him to find me, save me from the Beast Jace has become This was supposed to be our new beginning we were meant to start fresh, a clean break. They all said that Jace was a monster a dangerous man that I should steer clear of but they had it all wrong. It s only when Raven comes out to play does he become the person so many fear. I was so wrong to think I understood him. No one understands him I thought I knew who he was but I had no idea the secrets he was keeping from me and the Club. I should have listened to their warnings, should have taken their advice but I had been drawn to a broken soul and I thought I could mend it .fix him somehow. After all is said and done, only one question remains who will fix me when I break?
