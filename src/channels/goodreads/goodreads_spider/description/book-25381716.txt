25381716:::::Quest for the Virgins:::::Beginning with the crossing of the feared Mona Passage between the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, 'Quest for the Virgins' takes the reader on a leisurely cruise along the south coast of Puerto Rico, Vieques and the Virgin Islands. 'Quest for the Virgins' is a title, a destination and a state of mind, where extraordinary true adventures become commonplace. With time on our side and a beautiful sailboat under our feet, we take the less traveled path. 'Quest for the Virgins' explores the lifestyle of the relatively rare solitary cruiser. With a preference for nature over the colorful community of expat sailors, boat parties and bars, 'Quest for the Virgins' presents a unique perspective. Perhaps a view that you may not expect. All events in the story are true and faithful recollections of our adventures. Come along as our preconceptions of paradise unravel into the rich tapestry of life. David Beaupre April 2015
