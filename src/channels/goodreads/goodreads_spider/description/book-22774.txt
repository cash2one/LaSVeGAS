22774:::::Slightly Settled:::::Remember Tracey Spadolini from Wendy Markham's hit "SLIGHTLY SINGLE? Well, she's back and looking and feeling fabulous. Only, this time she isn't slightly single, she is slightly settled--don't worry, we soon discover that it suits her. But first, Tracey will ignore her top two "Don'ts" for the office party--and land herself a hot new boyfriend, who happens to live with her new boss. (Did we mention that Tracey is hoping to get a promotion? Hmm, this could get interesting.) And second, Tracey will find herself the object of desire of not one (her current boyfriend), not two (her ex-boyfriend), but three men (someone she "used to think was Mr. Right). When did life for Tracey get so complicated?
