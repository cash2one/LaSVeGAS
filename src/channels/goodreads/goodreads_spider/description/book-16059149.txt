16059149:::::Magnolia:::::In Magnolia Branch, Mississippi, the Cafferty and Marsden families are southern royalty. Neighbors since the Civil War, the families have shared vacations, holidays, backyard barbecues, and the overwhelming desire to unite their two clans by marriage. So when a baby boy and girl were born to the families at the same time, the perfect opportunity seemed to have finally arrived. Jemma Cafferty and Ryder Marsden have no intention of giving in to their parents wishes. They re only seventeen, for goodness sake, not to mention that one little problem: They hate each other! Jemma can t stand Ryder s nauseating golden-boy persona, and Ryder would like nothing better than to pretend stubborn Jemma doesn t exist. But when a violent storm ravages Magnolia Branch, it unearths Jemma s and Ryder s true feelings for each other as the two discover that the line between love and hate may be thin enough to risk crossing over.
