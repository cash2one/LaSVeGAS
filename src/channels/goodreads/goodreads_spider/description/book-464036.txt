464036:::::Over the Waters:::::All Valerie Austin has ever wanted is to be married and have a dozen children. At age 30, she finally falls in love, only to be left--practically at the altar--by her groom-to-be. Dejected, Valerie decides to go on a short-term mission trip to a Haitian orphanage. In Haiti she meets another American, Max Jordan, a 47-year-old doctor with a tragic past. As Valerie falls in love with the Haitian people--and especially the children in the orphanage--she keeps running into Max. They develop a warm friendship, which ultimately turns romantic. But Valerie feels more and more called to remain in Haiti while Max plans to return to the States...but what is God's plan for them?
