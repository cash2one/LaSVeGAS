35014553:::::Archer:::::Archer Dean taught me how it feels to be loved. Really loved. The happily ever after, fairy tale type love. But he also taught me what real heartbreak was. He ripped away my happiness, took it from me without a backward glance. He left me alone and broken with no idea how to rebuild. No fight left in me to want to. Annabelle Edwards was a light in my world of darkness. She changed the way my heart beat, she let me believe in love. But the thing about darkness is that it s suffocating and without warning, the light that you rely so heavily on, can be extinguished by the power of your own shadows. Our story is about pain. About fighting through feelings that can sometimes be greater than love. Fear. Anger. Hurt. Sadness. Our story is aching. It s passionate. It s consuming. We ve felt loss. Felt abandoned by one another. We ve felt betrayed. Lost. But we fought. Against our love. For our love. Together. Apart. We ve done it all. We ve fought for our love to exist. For it to survive. It s been a broken road. Hopeless at times. Full and seamless at others. We ve been through hell and we have to trust that our love is strong enough to overcome anything.
