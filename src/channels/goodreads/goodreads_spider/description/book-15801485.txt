15801485:::::Christmas Rescue at Mustang Ridge:::::A TEXAS SHERIFF IN NEED OF A CHRISTMAS MIRACLE Sheriff Jake McCall is about to break the law. To find a bone marrow donor for his ailing baby girl, he'll hack into WITSEC to track down Maggie Gallagher-the only person who could be a genetic match. Yet by doing so, he is jeopardizing not only his badge, but Maggie's life, as well. Expecting to have to force Maggie against her will, Jake is unprepared for her willingness to help-and for the desire and hunger she arouses in him. Still, those forbidden feelings could make Jake reckless, and losing focus now isn't an option. With time running out and a killer on their heels, Jake has to keep Maggie alive-and give his daughter a Christmas miracle.
