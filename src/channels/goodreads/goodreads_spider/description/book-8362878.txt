8362878:::::Sun Stand Still: What Happens When You Dare to Ask God for the Impossible:::::If you're not daring to believe god for the impossible, you may be sleeping through some of the best parts of your Christian Life. "This book is not a Snuggie. The words on these pages will not go down like Ambien. I m not writing to calm or coddle you. With God s help, I intend to incite a riot in your mind. Trip your breakers and turn out the lights in your favorite hiding places of insecurity and fear. Then flip the switch back on so that God s truth can illuminate the divine destiny that may have been lying dormant inside you for years. "In short, I m out to activate your audacious faith. To inspire you to ask God for the impossible. And in the process, to reconnect you with your God-sized purpose and potential." Steven Furtick, from Sun Stand Still Steven Furtick challenges all of us from the missionary in the third world to the family in the suburbs to believe God for the impossible and begin living a life of faith beyond the ordinary. ANDY STANLEY, senior pastor, North Point Community Church I don t know anyone better positioned to challenge you to rise above mundane living and embrace faith-filled audacity than Steven Furtick. Craig Groeschel, senior pastor, LifeChurch.tv For too long Christians have embraced a miniscule vision of faith. Steven Furtick reminds us that the God who accomplished the impossible through the great heroes of faith still desires to do the same through us today. Jentezen Franklin, senior pastor, Free Chapel This book will show you that your hopes and expectations are truly just the beginning of what God can do. Ed Young, senior pastor, Fellowship Church
