347245:::::The Pathfinder:::::The third novel in James Fennimore Cooper s Leatherstocking Tales, starring the heroic Natty Bumppo. Vigorous, self-reliant, amazingly resourceful, and moral, Natty Bumppo is the prototype of the Western hero. A faultless arbiter of wilderness justice, he hates middle-class hypocrisy. But he finds his love divided between the woman he has pledged to protect on a treacherous journey and the untouched forest that sustains him in his beliefs. A fast-paced narrative full of adventure and majestic descriptions of early frontier life, Indian raiders, and defenseless outposts, The Pathfinder set the standard for epic action literature. With an Introduction by John Stauffer And an Afterword by Thomas Berger
