11187861:::::The Years Distilled: Verses:::::The Years Distilled are the verses from twenty years of spoken word and performance poetry on stages and in coffee houses around the United States. While the collection only represents a small fraction of the writing done over two decades (1990-2010) it is an almost complete collection of the pieces performed. The ranting and rambling contained within this book is often juvenile, sometimes petty, and commonly complaining; however all the works are all born of passion. The people and places that inspired the words between these covers are too numerous to mention individually, but they are all held very dear. It is because these souls, times, and locations have touched so deeply that a permanent mark was left. These memories are now yours to share, for what they're worth. These are all very different works of varied style and subject matter, plucked at random from a collection of writing. They are in no order whatsoever. What is the common thread? Everyone one of them was written to be performed, and with only two exceptions, they all have been.
