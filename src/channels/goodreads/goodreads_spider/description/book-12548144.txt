12548144:::::Roses in Winter:::::AN EXTRAORDINARY JOURNEY OF LOVE! Riley Rosemont loved Savannah Graystone from the moment she was born. He vowed that "Forever isn't Long Enough for how much I love You!" Life in the icy northern Montana mountains is hard. But promises for a lifetime of love made him strong. Riley always swore that someday he'd marry that beautiful talented woman. But God had other plans for Savannah. God blessed her with a gift for music, pure inspiration flowing from her heart to the piano keys. Driven to share that music with the world, Savannah changed her name and ran away to New York City. She became a star. But Savannah stole something very precious from Riley and kept it a secret. She took what she could from Montana and followed her destiny. She was pregnant with their son. Seven years later, on a quiet road in upstate New York, Savannah and Ryan are in a devastating car accident. In two precious minutes she loses everything. Broken in body and spirit, one icy winter day Savannah returns home to Montana. Snow is falling fast, bitter and cold from the oncoming October storm. Her hand is on the door to Graystone Heights, her childhood home. The giant ski lodge has been deserted for years. But behind her a dog growls. She isn't alone... Graystone is Riley's home now. He hates her for leaving. But he hates Savannah even more for stealing away his son. Ryan wasn't a secret, after all. Riley knew the truth. And he loved Ryan with all his broken heart. They need a miracle.
