18513824:::::O Young Man:::::When do we teach our children? What do we teach them? How do we teach them? The Messenger of Allah (Peace and Blessings of Allah be upon him) showed the way of tarbiyah for Muslims in his life-forming advice to Abdullah ibn Abbas. This book is an insight into the basic Islamic teaching that children should be taught significant things early in life, so that they may live a meaningful life. It is must for every home. Is it not time to call our children and advise them with the words of the Prophet (Peace and Blessings of Allah be upon him)? O young man, I shall teach you some words (of advice): Be mindful of Allah, and Allah will protect you. Be mindful of Allah, and you will find Him in front of you. If you ask, ask of Allah; if you seek help, seek help of Allah... (Tirmidhee) .
