In debt to Las Vegas casinos, he commits an almost unspeakable act that will send Angela's life into a downward spiral. She flees the West Coast for her family compound on Nantucket, where she plans to end the miserable charade that her life has become.

Slowly, the motley group of islanders bands together to coax Angela back from the edge. "Riveting until the end..." Kirkus Discoveries Review.
