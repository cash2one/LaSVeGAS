13386020:::::Howl:::::Nineteen year old Sophie Matthews is a line-walker between two worlds - human and werewolf. Her sanctuary is the Allegheny National Forest, the one place she can be free. That is, until she is spotted by Jaime, a conservation officer with an easy smile. What should have been a passing glance becomes much more as Sophie falls for the one thing she is forbidden from ever having: a human mate. Sophie learns that keeping secrets is never easy - especially around newcomer Daniel, the arrogant wolf on her tail. And yet Daniel may be the least of her worries. Old legends resurface. Humans in the town are whispering of wolf-men roaming the forest. Threat of discovery looms heavy around the pack and the key to it all might be Sophie's chosen, Jaime. Peaceful days are ending. Everything is falling apart around her. Will she risk it all - her heart, her family, and her safety - for a chance to control her own fate?
