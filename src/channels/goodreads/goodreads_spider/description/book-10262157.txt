10262157:::::Finding Forgiveness:::::To forgive is divine if he can pin his lover down long enough to beg for it. "Poconos Pack, Book 1" Ben Malone's role as Marshall attunes him to every nuance of the pack's wellbeing which means he's forced to feel every one of his mate's hangovers. It's the one reason Ben will never claim Dave Maldonado. Being alone is better than being with someone who lives in a bottle. Dave was destined to be a pack Alpha until his first migraine hit at age fifteen, the day he caught his future mate holding hands with another boy. In the nine agonizing years since, he's contented himself as Beta, but never learned to live with the pain and confusion of Ben's rejection. Dave's worst attack yet sends him to the hospital and brings them both face to face with the misunderstanding that's kept them apart all these years. It's too late, though. Dave is headed for Gay Pride Week at Disney World with one goal in mind. "Forget Ben Malone." Ben's got a problem with that. Only one man is destined to hold "his" David. And he'll give anything, even his last shred of pride, to win forgiveness and the right to finally claim his mate.
