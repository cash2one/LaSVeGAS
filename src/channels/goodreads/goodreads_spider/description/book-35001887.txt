35001887:::::Outsourced World - Seducing Goddess Durga During the Clinton Era:::::This forthright narrative chronicles the author s 1996 experiences as he adjusts to a massively transformed world. Emerging from 3 years in Saudi Arabia, and the 2 years prior cocooned in academia, he lands in Abu Dhabi to be hit with the triple-whammy of the NWO (1991), the WTO (1995), and the spigot of India Inc. opened wide. Considered too old (at 40) by his feminized native land, and too white-skinned by the Zio-Globalists, he must now face hostile (multicultural) politics and the economic subterfuge orbiting a liberal American empire dedicated to outsourcing and open borders. Follow this Engineer s eclectic adventures from the U.A.E., Malaysia, and England [Book-1] then on to India [Book-2] as he somehow negotiates a series of traps, obstacles, and near calamities while occasionally pausing to seduce a few of the world s most exotic women. This true, instructional, and entertaining testimony delivers a slew of lessons about how the 1990s cemented the fiscal and chronically unemployed quagmire plaguing the Western World since Y2K. Mesmerized by the Clinton White House , most people refused to listen back then. Twenty or more years on, could this book open your eyes now?
