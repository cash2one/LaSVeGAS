18078251:::::Annihilate Me Vol. 3:::::Jennifer's life is reeling out of control. Now, there is no denying her feelings for Alex--or his for her. After spending one night together, he took her to heights she never thought was possible. The passion they shared in that one moment is something she can't shake, and it consumes her, throwing her off her game. But this is no game. What they have is real. Still, even as events start to pull them close together, other events threaten to tear them apart. A threat is revealed. People aren't who they appear to be. And then there is their arrangement. Once, she was Alex's employee, the one woman who was hired to make certain he wasn't distracted from his work. Even though they are now in a committed relationship, what will that mean for Jennifer when she agrees to become his employee again--and when one major failure that costs his company millions is directly aimed at his involvement with her? Will their relationship survive--or will it fail? This story unfolds over multiple volumes approximately 50,000 words each. The Annihilate Me Vols. 1-3 are on sale now.
