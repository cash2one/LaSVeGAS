4390036:::::Citizen-in-Chief: The Second Lives of the American Presidents:::::[A] remarkably revealing history. This well-researched, opinionated account does a fine job of filling a surprisingly empty historical niche. Publishers Weekly Citizen-in-Chief, The Second Lives of the American Presidents, is a smartly researched, surprising, often witty, and always revealing look at former presidents from George Washington to George W. Bush. Authors Leonard Benardo and Jennifer Weiss offer readers entertaining true stories of the radical turns, provocative rehabilitations, and tragic trajectories of presidential lives after the White House. Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen calls Citizen-in-Chief, an engrossing book, Benardo and Weiss tell a fascinating tale, and he properly states that where our nation s leaders went after leading is often more interesting than the presidency itself.
