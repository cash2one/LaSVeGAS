22437126:::::Thrown Away: the Walking Papers:::::In 1992, Jeffrey McPoe plummets below the 40-50 feet deep cliff with his car, one heart-pounding event ahead of his disaster. As the investigator himself, it turned the other way around; he has just become the interrogated guy and the embassy's object of investigation. As the probe tracks his frantic race toward proving his innocence, he is tormented by mad visions and by the knowledge that his time in the embassy is running out, determined to fight back for his vindication. Responding to little more than the primitive quest for justice at any cost, he retreats ever deeper into the cradle of his own government, one which never has eyes glowed bright green in the headlight, and bares no fangs to bite for his case. "Thrown Away" takes you on a journey of investigation and an avowed loyalty of one of the Consular Investigators of the U.S. Embassy of two and a half decades.
