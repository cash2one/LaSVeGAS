29564135:::::Trailer Trash:::::It s 1986, and what should have been the greatest summer of Nate Bradford s life goes sour when his parents suddenly divorce. Now, instead of spending his senior year in his hometown of Austin, Texas, he s living with his father in Warren, Wyoming, population 2,833 (and Nate thinks that might be a generous estimate). There s no swimming pool, no tennis team, no mall not even any MTV. The entire school s smaller than his graduating class back home, and in a town where the top teen pastimes are sex and drugs, Nate just doesn t fit in. Then Nate meets Cody Lawrence. Cody s dirt-poor, from a broken family, and definitely lives on the wrong side of the tracks. Nate s dad says Cody s bad news. The other kids say he s trash. But Nate knows Cody s a good kid who s been dealt a lousy hand. In fact, he s beginning to think his feelings for Cody go beyond friendship. Admitting he might be gay is hard enough, but between small-town prejudices and the growing AIDS epidemic dominating the headlines, a town like Warren, Wyoming, is no place for two young men to fall in love.
