140475:::::In Evil Hour:::::Written just before One Hundred Years of Solitude , this fascinating novel of a Colombian river town possessed by evil points to the author's later flowering and greatness. Translated by Gregory Rabassa. "More than a prelude...the dazzling sense of place, the colorful idiosyncrasy of character are present for us to marvel over once again."-- The New Republic "An openly political novel posing the people of the land against the forces of oppression...it has the virtues of wit and compassion and reveals the foundation upon which the later novels were constructed."--Jonathan Yardley, Washington Star " One Hundred Years of Solitude is just around the rain-drenched corner."-- Boston Globe
