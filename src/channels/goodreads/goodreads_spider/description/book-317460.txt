317460:::::What Ho! The best of P.G. Wodehouse:::::Published to mark the 25th anniversary of PG Wodehouse's death, this is the first major new selection of his work to be published for a generation. This anthology of stories, novel-extracts, working drafts, articles, letters and poems gives a fresh angle on the twentieth century's greatest humourist. In his introduction, Stephen Fry writes: "What a very, very lucky person you are. Spread out before you are the finest and funniest words from the finest and funniest writer the past century ever knew... Without Wodehouse I am not sure that I would be a tenth of what I am today... He taught me something about good nature. It IS enough to be benign, to be gentle, to be funny, to be kind."
