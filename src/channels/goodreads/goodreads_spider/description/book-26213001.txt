26213001:::::"Humanism - The Whore of Babylon and the Sleeping Church":::::.., Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light. Ephesians 5:14 (KJV) The Church of Jesus Christ is asleep. Bible Prophecy has not been taught in most churches in thirty years. Christians are not prepared for the dark days ahead. The Spirit of Anti-Christ is enthroned in Washington DC and the One World Religion mentioned in Revelation Chapter 17, Whom the Apostle John called The Whore of Babylon Mother of Harlots is positioned and ready to prepare the way for The Anti-Christ. (The Man of Sin) I expose the Harlot who rides the Beast. I show how she first appeared in the Garden of Eden, and continued to appear throughout every world government from Nimrod and His Tower of Babel to our present forming New World Order. The Harlot is Alive in the United States of America working very hard to complete her role as the destroyer of Christianity, by eliminating the Judeo-Christian Worldview and minimizing the role of Christian influence in the world. This book is a warning to Christians who are asleep. Wake up, turn to Jesus and His Word, and stop compromising your faith in order to get along with the world. Wake Up Church!!! Jesus is coming soon. Be ready for His Return.
