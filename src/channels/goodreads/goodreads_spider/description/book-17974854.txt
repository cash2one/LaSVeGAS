17974854:::::Our Virtuous Republic: The Forgotten Clause in the American Social Contract:::::Is it no longer a "self-evident" truth that government's nature is to become tyrannical? "Our Virtuous Republic" is the book the establishment does not want Americans on the right, left, or center to read. The argument is a vociferous and comprehensive defense of American traditionalism, a lesson in American citizenship, and a call for a return to civil society. Conservatives academics and politicians have failed to make a decisive argument for our founding principles. As a result, the progressive narrative has attached an unsubstantiated backward stigma to the ideals born of the American mainstream Protestant ethic, such as civic duty, obligation and other elements of American traditionalism that are necessary for a healthy society. Baris uses psychology, logic, economics, history, and science to deconstruct the progressive argument to its regressive core. Breaking through the superficial, he explains how our human nature interacts with the different elements of each political philosophy in American politics. The evidence, in total, points to one conclusion. There is a Natural Law that illuminates the path to human happiness and well-being. Our Founding Fathers designed the American social contract in accordance with Natural Law to ensure that we would all have the opportunity to achieve the highest state of being. Honoring the terms of that social contract is the true path to progress.
