510247:::::April Fool's Day:::::In the end, love is more important than everything and it will conquer and overcome anything. Or that s how Damon saw it, anyway. Damon wanted a book that talked a lot about love. Damon Courtenay died on the morning of April Fool s Day. In this tribute to his son, Bryce Courtenay lays bare the suffering behind this young man s life. Damon s story is one of life-long struggle, his love for Celeste, the compassion of family, and a fight to the end for integrity. A testimony to the power of love, April Fool s Day is also about understanding: how when we confront our worst, we can become our best.
