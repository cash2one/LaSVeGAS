920219:::::Escape:::::Samuel has just landed in modern day LA. The last time he has been free of Nefandus was when he was abducted from his home two hundred years ago. He is totally lost until Ashley shows up. She used to be a servi, like him, but now she helps others who have escaped their bondage. He and Ashley travel back in time to see his great grandfather, a wise shaman. After Samuel returns to the present, he realizes his grandfather has given him a very special gift-one that is difficult to control. He also begins to wonder if Ashley is really who she says she is . . . Soon his loyalty to the other Sons of the Dark is sorely tested.
