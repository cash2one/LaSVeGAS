19166216:::::The Mosquito Coast:::::Allie Fox is going to re-create the world. Abominating the cops, crooks, junkies and scavengers of modern America, he abandons civilization and takes the family to live in the Honduran jungle. There his tortured, messianic genius keeps them alive, his hoarse tirades harrying them through a diseased and dirty Eden towards unimaginable darkness. An epic of paranoid obsession that swirls the reader headlong to deposit him on a mudbank of horror Christopher Wordsworth, Guardian.
