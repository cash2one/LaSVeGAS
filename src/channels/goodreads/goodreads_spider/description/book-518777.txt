518777:::::The Warrior Within: The Philosophies of Bruce Lee:::::During his lifetime, legendary martial artist Bruce Lee formulated a complex personal philosophy--a synthesis of Eastern and Western ideals--that extolled the virtues of knowledge and total mastery of one's self. However, most of his philosophical writings could be found only within the personal library of the Bruce Lee estate--until now. "The Warrior Within" is the most comprehensive volume of these teachings, meant to help you apply Lee's philosophies to your own life. This unique guide reveals such life-affirming secrets as: Seeing the totality of life and putting things into perspective Understanding the concept of Yin and Yang Defeating adversity by adapting to circumstances Tapping into inner spiritual forces to help shape the future With a foreword by Linda Lee Cadwell and photographs and other memorabilia from Bruce Lee's short but celebrated life, "The Warrior Within" is an engrossing and easy-to-understand guide to the little-explored world of Bruce Lee. John Little has been identified as "one of the foremost authorities on Bruce Lee in the world" by "Black Belt" magazine. He edited a three-volume series for the Bruce Lee estate and has written articles for several publications, including "Men's Fitness, Official Karate," and "Inside Kung Fu."
