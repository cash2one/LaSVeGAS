34832903:::::The Golden Thread: Esoteric Hitlerism:::::The link between Hitlerism and a millenarian, necessarily esoteric, and in any case suggestive tradition is a thesis that Miguel Serrano enunciated in Chile well before The Morning of the Magicians. After years of research, mystical experiences in India, and interviews with the most interesting personages of the 20th century Hesse, Jung, Pound, Skorzeny, Degrelle the author develops that primitive insight into a delirious exposition. Gnostics, Cathars, Rosicrucians, Templar Knights, Knights of the Thule Order, hidden leaders of National Socialism parade through the pages of this book, to be found in unexpected castles and monasteries, fighting astral battles whose echoes are recorded in history and which are won or lost in accordance to the direction of the swastika, a symbol that appears inexplicably in epics and cultures apparently alien to one another. Revelatory authors from the 1960s and 70s Moln r, Bloch, Evola, V gelin have shown the nexus that links utopias, heresies, and secret societies to politics. Miguel Serrano, on the basis of documentation, abundant iconographic material, and unpublished testimonies applies the same methodology to National Socialism, with surprising and polemical results. This authoritative English-language edition authorised by Miguel Serrano's estate and produced with their full collaboration and support comes with a full complement of endnotes, a comprehensive index, and the author s corrections, none of which were present in the two Spanish-language editions.
