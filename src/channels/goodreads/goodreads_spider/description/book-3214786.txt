3214786:::::Chance of a Lifetime:::::It's a night for adventure, for pushing the limits. Well, breaking them actually. Stacie can't believe she's stolen her escort's Porsche to go back road joyriding. But damn, it feels good to cut loose from her life for one precious night. It's just her lousy luck she catches the eye of an off duty cop.Just her luck, indeed. Being reprimanded by Lieutenant Jake Chance, the sexiest man she's ever seen, makes her want to break a few more laws. She's going to throw caution to the wind and see if she can seduce her cop to go over the limits with her. Way over.If Jake Chance is willing to hold her in his arms, Stacie knows she'll have a memory to last her a lifetime. She just wishes dawn would never come, because when it does, she'll have to let him go.
