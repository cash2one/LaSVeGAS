2319645:::::Surprised by Hope: Rethinking Heaven, the Resurrection, and the Mission of the Church:::::In Surprised by Hope: Rethinking Heaven, the Resurrection, and the Mission of the Church , top-selling author and Anglican bishop, N.T. Wright tackles the biblical question of what happens after we die and shows how most Christians get it wrong. We do not go to heaven; we are resurrected and heaven comes down to earth--a difference that makes all of the difference to how we live on earth. Following N.T. Wright s resonant exploration of a life of faith in Simply Christian , the award-winning author whom Newsweek calls the world s leading New Testament scholar takes on one of life s most controversial topics, a matter of life, death, spirituality, and survival for everyone living in the world today.
