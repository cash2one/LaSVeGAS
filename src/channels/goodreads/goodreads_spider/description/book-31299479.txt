31299479:::::Melting Steel:::::KEELEY I know his type. Stuck up. Arrogant. The kind of guy who hasn't had to work for a damn thing his entire life. Even his name, Henry Caldwell III, reeks of privilege. And me? Well, let's just say I come with more baggage than a 747 and enough bullsh*t to fuel it. The problem is I want him. Crave him. It's the kind of pure, all-consuming, panty-soaking lust that can make a girl forget why she swore off men to begin with. He thinks I need saving. But this isn't a Cinderella story, and he's no Prince Charming. At least not mine. I learned long ago that trusting any man with my heart isn't just dangerous - it can be deadly. HENRY Emotionally crippled, smart-mouthed, and sexy as sin, the woman is nothing I need and everything I want. Despite her hard edges, tattoos, and reckless spirit, I know she craves more. More from life, more from love, more from me. She thinks I'm just a trust fund brat and maybe she's right. But I've got secrets of my own. I know what darkness is. I've lived it - faced the pit of hell and barely survived. The question is, am I strong enough to face it again? Because if I'm ever going to break through the steel wall she's placed around her heart, it'll mean facing demons we both thought were long dead and buried.
