23174601:::::Pocketful of Poesies:::::Pocketful of Poesies is unlike any publication you have ever previously perused and that is quite a phenomenal pursuance. Pocketful of Poesies is a pick of perfectly plangent dark tales. An astonishing array of very short stories that take alliteration to a completely new level with absolutely EVERY word beginning with the same letter. This mind blowing volume of amazing alliteration, such as Annie and Adam s Adventure at Arthur s Animal Aid Association, Betty Bets Billy Bout Blowing Bigger Bubbles Better, and Colin Couldn t Comprehend Chafing Cream WILL blow your mind. The alphabet may have 26 letters but there is no rule that each word you use has to start with a different one each time and Toula Mavridou-Messer proves just that in Volume One of Pocketful of Poesies.
