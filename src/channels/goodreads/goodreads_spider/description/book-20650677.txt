20650677:::::Unmasked: Volume One:::::I was born into this world unwanted. I spent the first hours of my life unloved. I spent the first eighteen years of my life with the parents who tried to shelter me from the harsh reality of my existence. But you can t un-write a sad story if the ending is literally written all over your face. So I moved out and now I hide. I have a night job that pays the bills. Every night, I put on my mask and walk to work. Then one night, I hear and see something that will change my purpose in life... forever: a murder that will bring him to me. He says he wants to protect me. And, through a series of events I can t fully make sense of, I find myself believing him. But our nightly visits are always cloaked in darkness. I don t know his face and he will never know mine. I was born into this world unwanted. I will leave this world unmasked.
