15678219:::::Hey James!: A James Collectio:::::The little kid with the giant personality is back Hey, James is the second collection of acclaimed comic strips from the award-winning pen of cartoonist Mark Tonra. James may or may not be the center of the universe-as he thinks-but there's no arguing that he is indeed at the heart of one of the most inventive "kid" strips to hit the funny pages in almost a decade.With his equally lovable and quirky conspirators along for the ride, James explores the world and himself-laying bare the fragile and eccentric humanity in all of us. In a neighborhood where shirt gerbils prance and hungry shadows raid refrigerators, James chugs life like a summertime slurpy-without the brain freeze.Using his clean spontaneous pen line, Mark Tonra again marries insight and whimsy to deliver a book that's both hilarious and enlightening. Hey, James is a satisfying celebration of every reader's inner and outer child. Enjoy
