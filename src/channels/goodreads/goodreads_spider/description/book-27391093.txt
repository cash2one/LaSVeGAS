27391093:::::The Quirky Tale of April Hale:::::Tall, dark, and mysterious Ryder Black is everything a girl wants. The catch? He s trouble. Naturally, he s irresistibly charming. Surprisingly, he s impressively academic, too. But it s his knack for getting into fights that makes him notorious. Dorky, clumsy, and just plain odd April Hale talks like Yoda, eats her food based on the day of the week, and prefers binge watching TV shows to partying. She has also spent the past few years eavesdropping on the Blacks morning fights. It was her daily routine. Until that one morning that Ryder catches her looking into his bedroom window and she becomes all but anonymous in his eyes. Hell-bent on making contact, Ryder gets a sneak peek into the quirky world of April when she stuffs all of her fingers in her mouth and faints the first time he talks to her. She s unusual. He s captivated. In this delightfully wacky and fun story, we discover that sometimes what makes us outcasts from the world are the very things that make us special. Join April and Ryder in their journey to discovering more about life and about each other. It will give you butterflies in the stomach, tickle your funny bones, and pull at your heartstrings until the very last page.
