7195554:::::Latte Daze:::::Maya Davis already has many titles-Christian, barista, maid of honor (new), possible girlfriend (newer), aunt (newest)-and her life is about to become even more complicated. Just when she thought things couldn't get any worse, her ex-boyfriend proposes to her roommate and best friend, Jen. It's not long until their apartment becomes Wedding Central. As if that weren't enough, Jen's obnoxious mom moves in to help plan the wedding, and Maya's genius brother and sister-in-law announce that they're expecting. Then to top it off, there's the whole matter of Jack-is it love? Who wouldn't need a coffee break!
