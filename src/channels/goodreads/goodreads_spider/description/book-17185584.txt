17185584:::::Double Trouble:::::Sally Brooks is feeling somber about her life as those around her find love. She wants to have a boyfriend or two, wants someone to hold her, make her feel loved and protected. The two men she finds irresistibly attractive are ex-military brothers Mason and Steven Marcus. But they avoid her even when she makes an effort to flirt. Fed up and overwhelmed, Sally accepts a date with Garret Walters. He's a good-looking cowboy with money and attitude. Accepting his date turns into a horrible experience. Garret and his friend Keiffer had plans to abduct Sally. It takes this incident, and the fact that Garret still wants to pursue Sally, to get Mason and Steven to open up about their feelings for her. Steven and Mason are double trouble in Sally's eyes, and they ignored her this entire time, so why should she give them a chance now when she feels like nothing more than a damsel in distress? Note: There is no sexual relationship or touching for titillation between or among siblings.
