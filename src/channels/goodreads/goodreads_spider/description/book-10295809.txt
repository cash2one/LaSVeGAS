10295809:::::Thyla:::::"My name is Tessa. I am strong. I am brave. I do not cry. These are the only things I know for certain. I was found in the outback, ragged as a wild thing. I have no memory; not even of how I got the long slashes across my back. They make me frightened of what I might remember. The policewoman, Connolly, found me; and placed me; in a boarding school and told me about her daughter, Cat, who went missing in the outback. I think there is a connection between Cat, me, and the strange things going on at this school. If I can learn Cat's story, I might discover my own and stop it happening again." A thrilling paranormal tale of shapeshifting, a centuries-old war, and finding out who you really are when your memories betray you.
