26007617:::::Dysmorphic Kingdom:::::Vesper is a scientific-minded young woman living in the kingdom of Malland. When she finds a detached talking penis in the woods, her sheltered life with its wistful fantasies of change explodes into chaos as the penis chases her home, wrecks her sister s engagement party, and causes a scandal so costly that it results in Vesper s forced engagement to a wart-faced widower who agrees to pay her family s debt. Vesper flees her engagement, hoping for a reward when she returns the penis to his owner the royal prince, no less. But she discovers that the penis isn t the only talking body part flying around the kingdom. People everywhere are falling victim to a magical disease that causes body parts to fall off and animate, and Vesper finds herself fighting an evil plot to create an army of body parts and a society of denial and control, one that deals with all problems by severing them.
