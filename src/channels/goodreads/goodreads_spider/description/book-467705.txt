467705:::::Reality Chick:::::All-hour study fests . . . all-night parties . . . Going away to college means total independence and freedom. Unless of course your freshman year is taped and televised for all the world to watch. On uncensored cable. Sweet and normal Ally Cavanaugh is one of five freshpeople shacking up on In the House , a reality show filmed on her college campus. (As if school isn't panic-inducing enough!) The cameras stalk her like paparazzi, but they also capture the fun that is new friends, old crushes, and learning to live on your own. Sure, the camera adds ten pounds, but with the freshman fifteen a given anyway, who cares? Ally's got bigger issues -- like how her long-distance bf can watch her loopy late-night "episode" with a certain housemate. . . . Freshman year on film. It's outrageous. It's juicy. And like all good reality TV, it's impossible to turn off.
