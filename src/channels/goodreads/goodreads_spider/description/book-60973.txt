60973:::::The Culture of Make Believe:::::Derrick Jensen takes no prisoners in The Culture of Make Believe , his brilliant and eagerly awaited follow-up to his powerful and lyrical A Language Older Than Words . What begins as an exploration of the lines of thought and experience that run between the massive lynchings in early twentieth-century America to today's death squads in South America soon explodes into an examination of the very heart of our civilization. The Culture of Make Believe is a book that is as impeccably researched as it is moving, with conclusions as far-reaching as they are shocking.
