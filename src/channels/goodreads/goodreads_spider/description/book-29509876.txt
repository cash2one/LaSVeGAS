29509876:::::Livin' la Vida Boba: You Are Born, You Grow Up, You Try to Reproduce, You Get Cheated On, You Reproduce , and You Die:::::Gathered together for the first time, a gourmet selection of the most read, most shared, and most insulted columns by the Bengal tiger Lucano Divina! After escaping from the Acheron Zoo, Lucano has been involved in the struggle against the imperialism of human stupidity, touching a range of subjects such as: the worst advice for a broken heart, you don t know what you got until someone else enjoys it, love gets better with damage, profession is the oldest prostitution in the world, and twenty-one things you shouldn t do to forget your ex, among other irrational truths. Thanks to his writings that strip the self-denominated most intelligent species on the planet, he has shown himself worthy of five death threats that would turn him into a rug, at least ten emails after each publication that seek to drive him mad with offenses, more than two-hundred thousand followers on social media, nineteen marriage proposals, and a previous book ( Prince Charming Opens Doors, the Buffoon Opens Legs ) that continues to enjoy sales success. Livin la Vida Boba not only compiles the highest peaks of the aforementioned struggle from September 3, 2007 to December 31, 2015 but also frames them in a new human life cycle: you are born, you grow up, you try to reproduce, you get cheated on, you reproduce (with another partner), and you die.
