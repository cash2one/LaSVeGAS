16100308:::::Winter Eve:::::There comes a time when setting your differences aside isn t just necessary, it s a means of survival. After losing over half of their dens to a group rogue shifters, the wolves and leopards merged as one Pack, but living together is much more of a challenge then they expected. Danica Welsh was born to be the leopard pack healer. An accident involving a drug induced youth left her badly burned and scared emotionally and physically. Without the ability to heal by touch, she secludes herself to the edge of town, away from Ashwood Falls overly concerned citizens. All hope of mating and family become a distant dream. When she finally starts to accepts the long, lonely existence ahead of her, a stranger crashes into her life, and her heart. After Nevan Mathews fianc died three ago, he submerged himself into his work, cutting off all reminders of a life he dreamed of with the woman he loved. He lets his step-mother talk him into taking the first vacation in five years to visit for the holidays. But an accident delays his travel plans, sending him to Danica s doorstep and raises a need he thought he would never feel again. Can they tear down the walls around their hearts and submit to the passion before another claims Dani for his own? Warning: Contains a shifter who's scars run deeper than skin, a human who has the heart of a shifter, and a snow storm that's sure to have them both reaching for warmth.
