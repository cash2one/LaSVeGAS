13423229:::::Stirring Up Trouble:::::"A seriously entertaining read." --Livin' Life Through Books "I had a big smile on my face the entire time I was reading it." --Author Karen Hall "Don't start this book late at night because you will not be able to put it down until you have finished it." --Mermaid from Tennessee Zoe Miller is a 15-year-old witch with a talent for potions. She's working hard to find a substitute for toad slime. Since fat-free margarine has been found to be a substitute for dead man's toe, she's hopeful that she'll find one. Then there's all the so-called normal stuff. Like high school, her annoyingly selfish "friend" Anya, and her crush on Anya's ex-boyfriend Jake. Now, Zoe's dad is dating Jake's mom, and things are getting more and more complicated. If only Zoe could brew a potion or two and set everything straight. Zoe can't. If she brews a self-serving potion, bad things will happen to her appearance. Like a crooked nose, giant wart, green skin, rotting teeth--the whole ugly witch stereotype. Zoe's tired of fate interfering so cruelly in her life. Can you really blame her for putting her potions to not-so-good use and stirring up trouble? ****************************************Excerpt: "Should we leave?" I whispered to Jake to distract him. "No," he said, leaning closer to me. Suddenly, he didn't seem as stressed but more like his old self. "I think I should kiss you." "What? No!" Oh my God! "Why not?" he asked in a low voice that sent shivers through me. I made myself look at him as I whispered, "Because you don't want to kiss me, you just want to bother Anya. And she's my best friend." "Right," he said, backing away. "I guess we shouldn't then." Of course, I'd really hoped that he would say that he did want to kiss me and not only to bother Anya. "Would it help that it would also drive our parents nuts?" Hmmm. "Let me think for a minute," I said. It would really mess with Dad's head. And that excuse would be good enough for Anya. I already had a major crush. How much worse could it get? Glancing at Anya and quickly judging how dark the theater was, I said, "Okay." Stirring Up Trouble is a Young Adult Romance.
