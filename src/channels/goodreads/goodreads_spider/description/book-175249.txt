175249:::::Bad Men:::::BAD MEN On the Maine island once known as Sanctuary, policeman Joe Dupree is the guardian of its secrets, keeper of its memories. He knows that Sanctuary had been steeped in carnage once, centuries ago, when its settlers were betrayed to their enemies and slaughtered. Now, a strange, otherworldly evil is about to descend again....With rookie officer Sharon Macy, Joe stands guard against a bloodthirsty band of men set on murder, robbery, and retribution. But unleashing the fury of the ghosts of the past will have unimaginable consequences for any who spill innocent blood on Sanctuary's shores.
