921846:::::Just Another Sucker:::::A man will do almost anything when a rich and beautiful woman offers him fifty thousand dollars just to make a telephone call.

Harry Barber is a sucker. After three and a half years in jail for a crime he didn't commit, with no job and no money, he is the perfect target of a brilliant plan to frame him for the brutal murder of a young girl.
