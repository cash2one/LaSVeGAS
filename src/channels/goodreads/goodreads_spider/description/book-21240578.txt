21240578:::::Cries of a Teenage Boy:::::Set in the nineties in an upscale part of Los Angeles we are drawn into the dark, raw, emotionless world of privileged teenager Alec who sees the world as a place of emptiness, hopelessness and a place where misery lingers. One night after becoming intoxicated by cocaine and liquor, Alec commits murder with no sign of a soul in his eyes as his best friend watches on with horror. A year passes and Alec returns to the seedy underbelly of the city and reconnects with old friends and sexual partners. He s once again drawn into the world of drugs and random sexual encounters as he slowly discovers his friends having moved on but the shadow of that night still hangs over him, holding him back from even attempting something real. Caught between the world of drugs and helping his former best friend recover from a life of prostitution and poverty, is this a world where there really is no hope.
