23872348:::::Top Dog:::::Hooligan gang leader Billy Evans is above the law. He knows it, and they know it. And when you regard the law as an irrelevance, all kinds of opportunities can open up for you. Especially when you begin to exert your increasingly powerful influence over the back street pubs and clubs of East London. So when Billy gets the chance to make some serious money very quickly by helping a football club with an insurance scam, he grabs it with both hands. But he s about to discover that this time, he's finally pushed his luck too far. And this time it isn't the law he'll have to contend with. It's something far more dangerous. About the Author A multi-published best-selling author and increasingly sought after screenwriter, best known for penning the multi-award winning Green Street, former serviceman Dougie Brimson is one of the UK's most prolific writers. With over half a million books sold worldwide, his first title Everywhere We Go (first published in 1996) remains a cult classic whilst his first novel, The Crew, has held the #1 slot on the soccer charts of both Amazon and iTunes for over 17 months and is the most downloaded football title of 2012! However in recent years, thanks to his comedy novels including Billy's Log, The Geezers Guide to Football and The Art of Fart, Dougie has become increasingly identified with his often controversial defence of the male of the species and is a frequent guest on radio and TV talking all things men!
