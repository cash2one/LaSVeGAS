25191992:::::Life After:::::Before her. I was empty inside. I was lost . I was settling . I had no idea of the potential I had inside of me. After her. I was whole . I was happy . I was in love . She made me better. I never imagined I would find someone who completed me, just to lose her . I never imagined the love I felt could be overshadowed by the deepest depression I've ever lived through. It's been two years since she touched my life. Since she was taken from me . I don't know that I'll ever experience an ounce of the love she made me feel. I hope I'm wrong. My name is Topher, and this is my story.
