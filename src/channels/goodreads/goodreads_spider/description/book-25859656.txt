25859656:::::Screw Friendship:::::Career-obsessed Rosy Friendship has planned out her future, down to the biotech company she ll work for once she graduates. Frank is Rosy s biological dad, a man Rosy s been shielded from her entire life, a man so monstrous, his own mother has snipped his face from all the family photos. This summer, the summer Rosy thinks will be the start of her high-flying genetics career, she will set eyes on Frank, and genetics might well be her undoing. Because nothing has prepared her for the encounter, for the unfathomable urge to help Frank, or for the ungodly contents of her grandmother s biscuit tin. Rosy s determined digging is about to reveal that everybody in her circle of friends and family hides beastly secrets. Even Snuggy, the sausage dog. This self-contained, darkly fun novel tells a complete story with no cliffhanger ending, but it's also the start of an epic mystery, the story of a murder many years ago and of Frank Friendship, the murderer s son.
