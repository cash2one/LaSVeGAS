35648165:::::All of the Rogers:::::"How can you love someone so much, and need space from them at the same time?" My alarm goes off at four am. It takes an hour to get to the studio, and then my ballet training begins. I go to school for a few hours, and then it s back to the studio for more training. Go to bed. Repeat the whole process the next day. I hate it. My time at school is a blur, except for biology. I don t rush through that class, because I get to see Roger Byrnes. He probably doesn t even know I exist, but my heart beats a little faster when I see him walk through the classroom door with his messy hair and carefree attitude. He has so much energy. But then he stares off into the distance, and I wonder what he s thinking. It s the highlight of my day. I wish I could quit ballet so I could be a normal teenager. Someone who Roger would want to be with. I could use some excitement in my life I bet Roger could give that to me.
