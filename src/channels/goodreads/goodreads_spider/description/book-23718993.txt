23718993:::::THE YEAR OF THE FROG:::::Dig into the mind of a middle-aged woman trying desperately to fit into society chained with churches on every corner, consumerism for prosperity and the idea of coupledom to feel complete. Two years ago something snapped and Juls sold everything including her successful private practice to run away alone and focus on her own healing. THE YEAR OF THE FROG candidly portrays the struggle she went through trying to do everything perfectly to fit into a society entrenched with what she calls Controligion . In the book she defines Controligion as a way to command with the illusion of a moral code keeping the soul small. Juls tried to fit into that world for over 40 years seeking the Prince of Peace for salvation, consumerism for prosperity and kissing frogs to find Prince Charming. She abruptly sold her entire life to seek her soul. Juls traded in scientific fact for feeling, medical journals for Shamanic healing and the church for Mother Earth s teachings - turning her mid-life crisis into a mid-life awakening.
