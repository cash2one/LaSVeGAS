6116682:::::Running the Nullarbor:::::Times are tough in Western Australia. There's a war on, though nobody will call it that yet. Dan, injured in the line of duty, now takes in orphaned children until the Red Cross can find a place for them. He's become an old hand at looking after the kids, running his little hand crank radio, and just surviving. That is until Sid rolls up to his house on a motorcycle, claiming to be the uncle of the baby girl Dan is currently looking after. It isn't that Dan doesn't believe Sid, it's just that the man knows nothing about taking care of babies and Dan doesn't see how Sid is going to manage taking the child across the outback on his bike. Heavy bombing in the area prompts Dan to flee eastward with Sid and the baby, but neither Sid nor the baby are your ordinary humans and the so-called police action is becoming more and more of a war every day. Will Dan and his companions survive the army, magicians, the war, the outback, and, worst of all, Sid's relatives becoming something more than they are?
