15703505:::::Much Ado About Magic:::::Katie Chandler is back in New York and at Magic, Spells, and Illusions, Inc. and just in time. The city s in the grip of a magical crime wave from spells that wizarding whiz Owen Palmer thinks look awfully familiar, and the rogue firm Spellworks is raising its profile in the magical world by selling protective amulets. It s Katie s job as the new director of marketing for MSI to fight this battle of public perception while Owen and the other wizards try to uncover what s really going on. What Katie doesn t realize is that her idea to stage a showcase for MSI s magical achievements is playing right into a devious plot more than three decades in the making. Now Katie has to do damage control that has nothing to do with marketing. To save the magical world, she ll have to prove who the real enemy is, and doing that will require digging deeper into Owen s mysterious past than he wants anyone to go. If she fails, she not only stands to lose a magical war, but she could also lose the man she loves.
