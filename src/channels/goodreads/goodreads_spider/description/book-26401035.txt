26401035:::::Necessary Evil:::::My name is Madeleine Warwick and I'm a woman under siege. Several years ago, a treasure hunting reality show resurrected the long-forgotten tale of Civil War treasure buried on my family's property. Ever since, amateur treasure hunters have been trespassing, invading our land. When their negligence cost my uncle his life, I forged a letter to disprove the treasure's existence. This stopped the hunters but only for a time. Now they are coming back and, what s worse, my secret has been discovered. Arrogant Professor Gregory Randall knows about the forged letter, and he can ruin me with one phone call. But he won t as long I let him stay on the property to search for the treasure himself. It isn't easy living in the same house as your blackmailer, and there's more to Randall than meets the eye. He s convinced there s something to find, and I m starting to think he might be right. But even as we race to find the treasure first, the situation is becoming dangerous. Someone is determined to stop us: and they aren't afraid to use violence to do so. I m running out of ideas, options, and time, and what s worse, my blackmailer is the only one I can rely on. My first defense is the last man I can trust.
