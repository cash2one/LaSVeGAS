14744397:::::Generative Energy: Protecting and Restoring the Wholeness of Life:::::This book tries to show, in clear language, that many of the problems we face seem more difficult than they really are, largely because our culture hasn't assimilated the scientific achievements of the last hundred years. Practical issues of health, education, and creativity are often considered as though science had nothing to offer beyond certain concrete facts. Holistic and coherent views emerge from many areas of science, illuminating questions such as: Longevity: Brain improvement: Biological regeneration: Ecological restoration: The meaning of stress: A solution for obesity: Fertility.
