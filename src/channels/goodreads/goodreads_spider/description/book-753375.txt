753375:::::Linda Howard Collection: Heartbreaker / White Lies:::::Heartbreaker The ranch she'd inherited was nearly bankrupt, and now Michelle discovered that she was also deeply in debt to John Rafferty, the tough-talking, hard-loving rancher who'd fascinated her since their first meeting years ago. But that fascination also scared her, and never more so than now, when he suggested a bargain that was far more tempting than it should have been. She refused to become his mistress in exchange for canceling the loan, for self-preservation as much as for anything else... White Lies You don't argue with the FBI. So when they summoned Jay Granger to identify her gravely injured, heavily bandaged ex-husband, she agreed to keep a bedside vigil. Strangely, even unconscious, Steve Crossfield wasn't at all like the husband she remembered. As he struggled toward awareness, he demonstrated a strength of character, a manly power, the old Steve had lacked. Ironically, she was more drawn to him than ever. When Steve finally awoke, Jay had a unique chance to recapture and even embellish the past. But would the new Steve ever share her cherished memories? Heartbreaker originally published as a Silhouette intimate moments, 1987. White Lies originally published as a Silhouette special edition, 1988.
