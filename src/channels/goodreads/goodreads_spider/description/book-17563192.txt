17563192:::::The Mourning After:::::From Adriane Leigh comes a passionately evocative story about wanting what's forbidden and giving in to desire so sharp and sweet it threatens to consume... Georgia Montgomery lives in an ever-present state of denial. It's the only coping mechanism she's found to overcome the horror that colors her past. Until one pleasure-seeking playboy turns her world on its axis. Georgia tries to ignore the tornado of emotion that sweeps through her system whenever Tristan is near, but just like an addiction, one look, one taste, one touch is never enough. And then there's Kyle, the doting boyfriend she's left at home for the summer, the one she gave her heart to when she was twelve, the one that holds her fragile love in his strong and steady hands. What was once comfortable turns unbearable, and soon Georgia finds herself fantasizing about the forbidden. The chemistry between Tristan and Georgia is scorching and it isn't long before the slow burn ignites into a full-blown wildfire that threatens to consume anything in its path. Denial is comfortable. Love is anything but. For mature audiences.
