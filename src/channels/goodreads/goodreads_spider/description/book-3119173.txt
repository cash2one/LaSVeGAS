3119173:::::Skin of Culture: Investigating the New Electronic Reality:::::This is a bold vision of the electronic media and the nature of reality in a world increasingly wired to technology. It proposes and explores concepts such as: whether democracy is outmoded and must be redesigned to reflect how technology affects power structures; whether the electronic media have extended our psychology as well as our nervous systems and our bodies; whether art must redress the balance with science and reclaim technology; and whether electronic media are reversing the effects of language, literacy and the alphabet, and whether this is a good thing.
