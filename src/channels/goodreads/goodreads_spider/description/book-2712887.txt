2712887:::::The Wild Road:::::A woman wakes in a strange room, covered in blood, surrounded by the dead. She does not know who she is. Pinned on her jacket is a crumpled note. Run, it reads. Lannes Hannelore is one of a dying race born to protect mankind against demonic forces. And while those who look upon him see a beautiful man, this illusion is nothing but a prison. His existence is one of pure isolation, hiding in plain sight, with brief solace found in simple pleasures: stretching his wings on a stormy night, long late drives on empty highways, the deep soul of sad songs. But when Lannes finds a young woman covered in blood- desperate and alone, with no memory or past- he will be drawn into a mystery that makes him questions all he knows. And though it goes against his natures and everything he fears, Lannes will risk his heart, his secrets, and his very soul in order to save someone who could be the love of his life... or the end of it.
