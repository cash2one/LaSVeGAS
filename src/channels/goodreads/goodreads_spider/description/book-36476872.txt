Attempts by Dirk s parents to expose the old man to Chicago society invariably end in disaster. The last thing Dirk wants is to spend more time with Pops than he has to. But Dirk s sister is getting married in LA, and his parents insist that Dirk drive the cantankerous crank there in time for the wedding. Dirk is forced to rethink his view on Pops the second they leave Chicago s city limits. Pops is actually a stoner and a secret romantic, having a very active online love life with a woman from Killeen, Texas. In an effort to finally bond with Pops, Dirk has an idea. He and Pops veer off course, endeavoring to find Pops s mystery woman. All they have is her name, but they are tireless in their valiant quest and grandfather and grandson are in for a big surprise when they eventually find her. This hilarious road trip follows two outwardly very different men who find they have more in common than they realize. The crazy adventures of Dirk and Pops testify to the magic of the open road.
