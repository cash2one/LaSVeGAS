17469607:::::War - Horseman of the Apocalypse:::::The mighty Horseman WAR has been feeling restless of late, a strange beckoning that he cannot explain seemingly calling out to him. Feeling the need to find the answer to this sensation he decides to journey to Earth in mortal form, all the while being exposed to one strange and humorous adventure after another as he tries to adjust to life as a human being. While there he experiences an overwhelming attraction to one woman. He soon finds out that she was his soul mate in a previous life... before he was chosen by God to take on the mantle of WAR, one of the Horsemen of the Apocalypse and one of the most feared and respected entities in the cosmos. Now, he must make a decision - will he continue to serve out the rest of his existence as the immortal Horseman, or will he choose to sacrifice everything in order to be with his true love once again? From the author: I credit the hard rock group Judas Priest for giving me the idea for this book. I was listening to their concept CD set "Nostradamus" and four of the characters mentioned in the story/music were the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. The idea popped into my head, "What if one of the Horsemen fell in love with a mortal woman?" I started working on it and this book was born.
