35894727:::::Playboy:::::They call me a playboy. Sure, I like to have fun with the opposite sex, but hey, in my line of work, who wouldn't? My name's Jonah and I work for Bunny Hunnies, a swimsuit magazine. Calling the shots, and taking pictures of gorgeous women is every man's fantasy, including mine. That is, until Chelsea Sincock walks onto the set of one of my shoots. I've known Chelsea since before she was this hot as hell vixen wearing nothing but a bikini. What is she doing here? Does her brother, Declan, know? Did I mention he's my best friend? This is going to be hard, I mean difficult, to work with her. And the more I gaze at her from behind the lens, the more I realize I'm in way over my head.
