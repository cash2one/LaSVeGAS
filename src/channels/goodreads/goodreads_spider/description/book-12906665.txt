12906665:::::Uncle Piper of Piper's Hill:::::Uncle Piper of Piper s Hill is an Australian classic which challenges the conventional image of the country and its inhabitants. First published in 1889, the novel is a perceptive exploration of the clash of values between the old and the new as they are played out within one family. Uncle Piper is a self-made man who has made his fortune as a butcher; when he sends the fare to Australia to his poor but pretentious relations living in England, the drama begins. Set in Melbourne after the gold rushes of the 1850s, Tasma s fascinating first novel explores the relationship between birth and wealth, art and experience, women and men. A gripping yarn that expertly evokes a range of characters who must come to terms with the values of the new land, Uncle Piper of Piper s Hill helped to link the old country with the new and to make a claim for the establishment of Australian literature.
