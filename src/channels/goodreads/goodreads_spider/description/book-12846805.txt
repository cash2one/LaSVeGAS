12846805:::::Dog and Dragon:::::The sequel to Dragon's Ring. A wry and clever young heroine coming into her magical powers is flung into the midst of power struggles and momentous battles in a medieval-style world where her coming may be the answer to a long-awaited prophecy of liberation from tyrannical rulers. Lyonesse: a world formed with a magic so deep that it takes a true king to hold its parts in balance. Yet there is no king on the throne, and a dark power struggle is underway between an ancient sorceress with her shadow army of destruction and the human subjects of Lyonesse s power-mad wizard. The only spark of hope is a prophecy that tells of a Defender who will one day come and set things to right. Young Meb, flung from her dragon-ruled homeland in another plane of existence into Lyonesse, doesn t think she s been called to be any kind of Defender. And she certainly isn t happy when she s immediately embroiled in the deadly power plots of the local royals. But Meb also happens to be an adept at the universe-folding skill of Planomancy, trained by a world-walking troubleshooter of the multiverse, the great Dragon Fionn himself a dragon who is desperately searching for Meb, whom he s come to love. Accompanying Fionn is Dileas, Meb s pet and the most loyal magic sheep dog in a thousand universes. If anyone can track Meb across time and space, Dileas can. As the legions of Shadow Hall gather to bring down the leaderless kingdom, Meb must decide whether to use her ability to become the Defender everyone hopes for if only to avoid becoming the plaything of tyrants. With the Dragon Fionn on the way, magical battle is joined, and the destiny of universes hangs upon the courage in one young woman s heart.
