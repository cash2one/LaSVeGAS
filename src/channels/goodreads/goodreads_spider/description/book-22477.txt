22477:::::The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution:::::In this 25th anniversary edition, Bailyn has added a substantial essay, Fulfillment, as a Postscript to the original text. In it he discusses the intense, nation-wide debate on the ratification of the constitution, stressing the continuities between that struggle over the foundations of the national government and the original principles of the Revolution. This study of the persistence of the nation's ideological origins adds a new dimension to the book and projects its meaning forward into vital present concerns.
