4974052:::::You, My Love: A Diary in Verse:::::13 January You are into me like flame and fire as no other desire could know such gentle fury ...like an undefined thirst incalculably uncontrolled, or passion spent in seeking a wild and wondrous rose. * * With love, as in life, there are no guarantees. (Except always a beginning, always an end.) Nothing else is certain, set in stone. Instead, malleable, turning, ever in flux... ebb, flow. So too, the heart--yet once fixed, as relentless as a star: the blaze too brilliant to be near, consuming all. Whether right or wrong, a force of such power and import, almost impossible to stop. Impossible not to desire above all things (whether prudent or unwise), to destiny or despair. May your star remain fixed--your love, the life it was meant to be.
