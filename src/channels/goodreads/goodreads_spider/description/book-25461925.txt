25461925:::::Craving's Creek:::::For the man he loves, he will fight body, mind, and soul. Fourteen years ago, on a sun-drenched summer day on the banks of Craving s Creek, Ryde swore to his best friend, Alistair, he d never be alone in the world. Though Alistair was destined for the priesthood, there was something beyond holy about the first kiss they shared. But a fun camping trip went horribly wrong when Alistair was involved in a horrific incident. Now, at age thirty-one, Ryde s life is a mess of alcohol and the painful imprint of his last look into Alistair s desperate eyes. Since the evil they encountered on that shore, his first love has been lost to him until he learns a friend s wedding is to be officiated by a priest named Father Alistair Genet. Amid the rush of emotions, one thought crystallizes: Ryde s love for Alistair not only has never died, it s stronger than ever. Stronger than God. But it may be no match for the church and the repressed memories that are slowly tearing Alistair s mind apart. Warning: Contains a drunken confessional, a self-destructive clergyman, and a fight to the spiritual death for love.
