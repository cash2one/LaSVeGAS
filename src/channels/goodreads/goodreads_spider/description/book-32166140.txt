32166140:::::Saving Kennedy:::::Two short stories about time travel, the JFK assassination, and the consequences of the choices we make. ALIBI INTERRUPTED When Stewart Hudson travels back in time to stop Lee Harvey Oswald from killing President Kennedy, he not only becomes Oswald's alibi, but he also finds himself stuck in 1963. To ensure Stewart gets it right this time, the wife of his future grandson confronts him before he leaves for 1963, and she quickly learns that meddling in the affairs of the past always has its consequences. THE VISITOR Theodore Garfield never believed the old farmer's story about the day the stranger appeared in his cornfield. And Theodore was even more skeptical about the letter the visitor left behind detailing the gradual downfall of America beginning with the assassination of a future president named John F. Kennedy. Years later the farmer's story is all but forgotten until a young senator named John F. Kennedy is elected president. With the farmer and the letter now long gone, will Theodore be able to prevent one of the most tragic days in American history?
