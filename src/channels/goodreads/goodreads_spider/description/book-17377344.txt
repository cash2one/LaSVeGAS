17377344:::::The Bainbridge Killings:::::Bainbridge Island is west of Seattle across the Puget Sound. The Island is approximately the same size as Manhattan, but there are just over twenty thousand people who live there. Bainbridge Island is filled with soaring forests, plush landscapes, gorgeous views, and expensive waterfront homes. It s the kind of place you go to retire, to vacation, or to really relax and enjoy life. It s not the kind of place you go to die. But people are... In this prequel to The Rock Star, Jon Stevens is in his prime, and he is forced to go to Bainbridge Island undercover to investigate the deaths of three couples. The local Sheriff has classified the deaths as suicides, but Stevens thinks they re killings, and with just over twenty thousand inhabitants on the Island, Bainbridge has a small town feel, where everybody knows everybody else s business, so Stevens has to investigate without the killer knowing he s there. Which could be next to impossible.
