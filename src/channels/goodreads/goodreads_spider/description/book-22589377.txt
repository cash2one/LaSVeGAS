The minute Rhia s runaway team thunders into town, Wystan Heckmaster feels the change in the air.

With a gut full of regret and a forgotten town filled with reformed demons, Wystan is certain of one thing: he can t be the man Rhia needs. But when the truth behind Rhia s flight from Nebraska comes to light, Wystan must open his soul and pray there s enough love between them to overcome the darkness rising from the Pit.
