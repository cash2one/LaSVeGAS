7794043:::::Black Friday Vol 1:::::All it takes is one murder to change a million lives, and that's exactly what happens to Kasheef Williams on a cold, black Friday. After a reunion with an old friend goes wrong in a Long Island night club, Kasheef is forced to protect himself by any means necessary. The only problem is that prying eyes see everything. Those eyes belong to Alija Bell. After walking in on a situation she was never meant to see, she runs; but Kasheef sees her face, and he tells her that it's best for her to get temporary amnesia. Afraid for her life and the safety of her daughter, she keeps her mouth shut--but when a tape of the murder surfaces, the only face that's visible is Alija's. Now the police are looking for their eye witness, and Kasheef has to get to Alija before her day comes to testify against him in court. In this dramatic, hood-savvy tale, things aren't always as they seem. Somebody holds the ticket to the jury's verdict. Lies and truth collide. Everyone has a different angle, but the only question is, who has the most influence over Kasheef's fate?
