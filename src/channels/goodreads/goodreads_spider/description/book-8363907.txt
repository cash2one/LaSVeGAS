8363907:::::A Beggars Purse:::::How do you react when approached by a homeless person? Do you stop and listen or simply walk away as if the person doesn't exist? Toni Nelson grew up in a beautiful home, set in an idyllic beach community, making friends with the hobos passing through town on the freight trains. Her grandparents' home was a 'safe house' for the roaming drifters, and Toni learned at an early age the joy that could come from showing compassion to those less fortunate. Later in life, Toni moved to Nevada and was struck by the amount of homeless and penniless peopling the city of Las Vegas. With a heart opened and sustained by God, Toni embarked on a journey to help the people who have nothing, and now shares her experiences in this touching and beautiful memoir. Join Toni in her journey to share God's love with the people around her, and discover the treasures that can be found in A Beggar's Purse.
