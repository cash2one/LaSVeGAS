But now he is trapped inside Najida which has been surrounded by enemies with Ilisidi, the powerful grandmother of his ally, Tabini-aiji, atevi leader of the Western Association.

Bren's mission is to negotiate with Machigi a young atevi lord who has never actually seen a human and somehow persuade him to cease his hostile actions against the West.

Bren's genius for negotiation enable him to make a daring trade offer to Machigi one that seems to interest the young warlord. But Machigi is suspicious of Ilisidi's motives, and, to Bren's utter shock, evokes an ancient law that jeopardizes Bren's life. Can Bren stay alive and not alienate Ilisidi or Tabini, while also representing the interests of their enemy? The long-running Foreigner series can also be enjoyed by more casual genre readers in sub-trilogy installments. Betrayer is the 12th Foreigner novel, and the 3rd book in the fourth subtrilogy.
