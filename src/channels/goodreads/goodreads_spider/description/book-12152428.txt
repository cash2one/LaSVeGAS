12152428:::::Impulse:::::Her submission can heal him. His dominance can free her. Southern Arcana, Book 5 Sera Sinclaire is a New Orleans rarity: a submissive coyote trapped in a town overrun by dominant shapeshifters. Worse, she lacks the willpower to deny the alphas-in-shining-armor who need her soothing presence, even when their protectiveness threatens to crush her hard-won self-reliance. The only shifter she doesn t want to push away is Julio Mendoza, a wolf so dominant he s earned a place on the Southeast council. Julio doesn t have the luxury of indulging in the vacation his psychic shrink insists he needs. He can't turn his back on responsibilities he s beginning to wish he d never shouldered. When an obsessive ex endangers Sera, though, instinct drives him to get her out of town. Watching her come to life outside the city makes him feel like he's finally done something right, and her touch ignites desire he doesn t want to ignore. But soon, lighthearted flirting becomes a dangerous game of seduction, where every day spent falling into each other is another day avoiding the truth. Sera's ex isn't the only one who d disapprove of their relationship. There are wolves who would kill to get Sera out of Julio's life starting with his own blood kin. Product Warnings Contains endless summer road trips, family drama, redneck werewolves, sexual power games and a taboo love affair between a submissive coyote who s among the last of her kind and a dominant wolf who loves his heroine s ass. Literally.
