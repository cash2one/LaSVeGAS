10907835:::::The Meerkats of Summer Farm: The True Story of Two Orphaned Meerkats and the Family Who Saved Them:::::The Colliers are a pretty normal family: mum, dad, two kids, two dogs and two cats ... Oh, and a few wallabies, two lemurs, several owls, Ringo the bad-tempered crane and two cheeky, hand-reared meerkats named Wren and Rascal. THE MEERKATS OF SUMMER FARM is the remarkable story of a year at Axe Valley Bird and Animal Park, following the birth of the adorable young kits. In her charming and often hilarious memoir, Jayne Collier describes how these two playful and ever-curious creatures became the park's star attraction and - in spite of permanent damage to her kitchen floor and occasional (subterranean) breaks for freedom - found a permanent place in the family's heart.
