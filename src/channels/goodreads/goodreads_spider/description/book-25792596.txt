25792596:::::Nobody s Children:::::An exciting story from the popular author of novels set in an African environment. Five children, but only one destiny. They have nobody, and Kenyan street-life is hard. Danger. Darkness. Drugs. Hunger. But there is still hope. When David, John and Susanne are orphaned, they end up in the hands of their cruel uncle. The boys decide to run away, promising to return for their little sister. Unfortunately they have no idea what is about to happen to her. And their own wishes for a better life in Nairobi dissolve into thin air, as they find themselves pressured into becoming members of a gang of street children. But hope springs eternal... Hana Hindr kov creates characters that are not only memorable, but unforgettable. This author s ability to give birth in print to living, breathing souls is exceptional. Nobody s Children is a real page-turner. The novel is based on the author s thorough knowledge of various typical Kenyan environments. The reader gets to know, in a highly readable and exciting way, the reality of the various layers of current Kenyan society. It s one of the few books that truly (albeit with authorial licence) explores the complexity of Kenyan society.
