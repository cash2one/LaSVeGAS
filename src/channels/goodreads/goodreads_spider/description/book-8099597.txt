8099597:::::Seeking Truth:::::NO LONGER AVAILABLE FROM ELLORA'S CAVE. Baron Eaduin Kempe, a man of intense passions, seeks a healer at a nearby abbey. When the abbess introduces convent-raised Lady V rit de Sauigni, he knows he s hellbound for desiring her. He wants to tie her to his bed until she sobs with the pleasure of his touch. Eaduin offers V rit marriage in exchange for easing the pain of his dying foster mother. Years ago, V rit secretly watched Baron Eaduin arouse a lover and has dreamed of his touch ever since. She desires him enough to risk exchanging the imprisonment of convent life for that of marriage. On their wedding night, Eaduin craves dominance and V rit submits with enthusiasm. Each heated encounter thereafter binds them closer together. When V rit s father accuses her of witchcraft because she won t use her psychic gift of seeing truth to aid him, she begs Eaduin to kill her so she doesn t suffer. Instead, Eaduin challenges her father to trial by combat, determined to save the woman who owns both his passion and his heart.
