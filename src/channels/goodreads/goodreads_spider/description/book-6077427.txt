6077427:::::The Other Lands:::::Several years have passed since the demise of Hanish Mein. Corinn Akaran rules with an iron grip on the Known World's many races. She hones her skills in sorcery by studying The Song of Elenet and she dotes on her young son, Aaden Hanish's child raising him to be her successor. Mena Akaran, still the warrior princess she became fighting the eagle goddess Maeben, has been battling the monsters released by the Santoth's corrupted magic. In her hunt she discovers a creature wholly unexpected, one that awakens emotions in her she has long suppressed. And Dariel Akaran, once a brigand of the Outer Isles, has devoted his labors to rebuilding the ravaged empire brick by brick. Each of the Akaran royals is finding his or her way in the postwar world. But the queen's peace is difficult to maintain, and things are about to change. When the league brings news of upheavals in the Other Lands, Corinn sends Dariel across the Gray Slopes as her emissary. From the moment he sets foot on that distant continent, he finds a chaotic swirl of treachery, ancient grudges, intrigue, and exoticism. He comes face-to-face with the slaves his empire has long sold into bondage. His arrival ignites a firestorm that once more puts the Known World in threat of invasion. A massive invasion. One that dwarfs anything the Akarans have yet faced...
