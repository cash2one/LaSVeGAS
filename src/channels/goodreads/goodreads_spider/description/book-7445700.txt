7445700:::::Beneath the Sands of Egypt: Adventures of an Unconventional Archaeologist:::::Donald Ryan is a rare bird a field archaeologist who can write with verve and immediacy. I heartily recommend his book to all Egyptology buffs. Barbara Mertz ( a.k.a. Elizabeth Peters), author of Temples, Tombs, and Hieroglyphs A real-life Indiana Jones, Donald P. Ryan, Ph.D., offers a breathtaking personal account of his adventures in archaeology in Beneath the Sands of Egypt. Fans of The Lost City of Z will thrill to the exploits of this unconventional archaeologist as he retrieves the remains of Egypt s past including his breakthrough discovery in the Valley of the Kings of Egypt s famous female pharaoh, Hatshepsut.
