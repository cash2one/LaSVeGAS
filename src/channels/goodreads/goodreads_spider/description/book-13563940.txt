13563940:::::Under the Thelian Sky: Beyond the Great Unknown:::::As everyone knows, God created mankind to his image (Genesis 01:27). What mankind does not know is that God did not create man on Earth, but rather on MARS! When Mars could not sustain life anymore, mankind had to escape the planet and colonized Earth. Many years later, a study was written about the survival of mankind in Sol Four (Mars) and its struggle in Sol Three (Earth). We proved to be a species that has survived wars, slavery and other forms of abuse -- always holding on to our faith in God. Doctor Ajidan Edejem, after finding out that his world was going to die, embarks in the dangerous mission to rescue as many people as possible and search for a new world. All the while, the government wants to keep everything quiet and even kill him for telling others about the unavoidable doom. "We discovered that the seismic activity is increasing and becoming more frequent causing volcanic eruptions, which increase the volume of sulfates in the atmosphere and break down Ozone. In other words, the atmosphere of this planet is bleeding into space. At the rate these phenomena are taking place, life on Taerr will no longer be supported in less than a month's time. The only way for our species to survive is to travel to another habitable planet. In our research, we have found a planet close to ours with a similar atmosphere about three months away. We have prepared a fleet of ships to take as many citizens as possible to this new planet. We will gather in three days' time, on the fields of the Thelia State Government University, scientists and other experts along with some clergy will welcome you." -- Doctor Ajidan Edejem (copyright, 2012)
