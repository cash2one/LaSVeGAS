9567932:::::The Man with the Easel of Horn:::::The Man with the Easel of Horn is an historical novel infused with the fine arts, based on the life and works of neglected master Emile Friant. Well known as a realist painter formed by the Cabanel atelier in Paris at the end of the 19th Cemtury, Friant was a master draughtsman and painter whose works are an extraordinary example of realism in art with academic formation at its core. From his birth in Alsace-Lorraine, The Man with the Easel of Horn follows in the artist's footsteps through the Franco-Prusian War and then, later on, through WWI. We are introduced to the Grand Salon de Paris and meet famous artists such as John Singer Sargent. The novel also reveals the passion and obsession of Emile Friant dealing with love and the question of sensuousness. It's a faithful reflection of life under la Belle Epoque. Very little has been written about Emile Friant and his works, so this novel breaks new ground in the field of fine arts. Professor Emeritus at the University of New England in Maine, Norman Beaupre writes both in French and English. He has done extensive traveling to do research on the subjects for his creative works. His last novel in English deals with Van Gogh in Arles. The author was decorated by the French Government with the insignias of the Ordre des Arts et Lettres with the rank of Officier for his contributions to the French culture."
