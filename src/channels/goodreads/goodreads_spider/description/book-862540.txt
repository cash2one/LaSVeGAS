862540:::::The Kindness of Women:::::Ballard here writes a brilliant hybrid of autobiography and fiction. The sequel to The Empire of the Sun, this work puts his earlier account of a boy s experiences in occupied Shanghai in the context of a lifetime. Ballard s eye has never been more cinematic, and his writing, especially in the love scenes, is a masterful blend of the raw and the tender.
