21442771:::::Sleep Paralysis: What It Is and How To Stop It:::::Sleep paralysis is a phenomenon in which people, either upon falling asleep or awakening, temporarily experience the inability to move, and it is often associated with terrifying sensations. Sleep paralysis is known by many names across the world including "Old Hag Syndrome" in the west. Some claims it is caused by "Shadow People," "Hat Man," or various evil spiritual beings like demons. Some but not all cases of "alien abductions" or incubus and succubus attacks (spiritual rape) can be chalked up to a severe sleep paralysis episode. The author of this book claims to know how to do something that most sleep scientists say is impossible: to stop sleep paralysis for good. Chris White has helped thousands of people stop sleep paralysis through his nonprofit websites and videos, and has conducted one of the largest surveys ever done on the subject. This book is intended to be an overview of what sleep paralysis is, what causes it, and a detailed explanation of how to stop it. It also contains many personal accounts from people who have stopped sleep paralysis using the methods described by the author. "What you showed me worked." - Jonathan S. "The experiences have now ceased." - Douglas J. "You cured my sleep paralysis." Mike B. "It has not returned to this day! Thank You." Joseph S.
