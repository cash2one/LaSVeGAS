10068074:::::The Train:::::Against all expectations Marcel Fer n has made a normal life in a bucolic French suburb in the Ardennes. But on May 10, 1940, as Nazi tanks approach, this timid, happy man must abandon his home and confront the Fate that he has secretly awaited. Separated from his pregnant wife and young daughter in the chaos of flight, he joins a freight car of refugees hurtling southward ahead of the pursuing invaders. There, he meets Anna, a sad-looking, dark- haired girl, whose accent is neither Belgian nor German, and who seemed foreign to everything around her. As the mystery of Anna s identity is gradually revealed, Marcel leaps from the heights of an exhilarating freedom to the depths of a terrifying responsibility one that will lead him to a blood-chilling choice. When it first appeared in English in 1964, British novelist and critic Brigid Brophy declared The Train to be the novel his admirers had been expecting all along from Simenon. Until The Train , she wrote, the dazzlingly prolific novelist had been a master without a masterpiece.
