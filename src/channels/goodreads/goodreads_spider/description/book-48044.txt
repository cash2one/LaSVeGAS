48044:::::The Book of Merlyn:::::This magical account of King Arthur's last night on earth spent weeks on the New York Times best-seller list following its publication in 1977.

The tale brings Arthur full circle, an ending, White wrote, that "will turn my completed epic into a perfect fruit, 'rounded off and bright and done.'"
