94667:::::Queen of Dreams:::::From the bestselling author of Sister of My Heart comes a spellbinding tale of mothers and daughters, love and cultural identity. Rakhi, a young painter and single mother, is struggling to come to terms with her relationship with ex-husband Sonny, a hip Bay Area DJ, and with her dream-teller mother, who has rarely spoken about her past or her native India. Rakhi has her hands full, juggling a creative dry spell, raising her daughter, and trying to save the Berkeley teahouse she and her best friend Belle own. But greater challenges are to come. When a national tragedy turns her world upside down and Rakhi needs her mother s strength and wisdom more than ever, she loses her in a freak car accident. But uncovering her mother s dream journals allows Rakhi to discover her mother s long-kept secrets and sacrifices and ultimately to confront her fears, forge a new relationship with her father, and revisit Sonny s place in her heart.
