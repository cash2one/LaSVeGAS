16073050:::::The Sh!t No One Tells You: A Guide to Surviving Your Baby's First Year:::::There comes a time in every new mother s life when she finds herself staring at her screaming, smelly "bundle of joy" and wishing someone had told her that her house would reek of vomit, or that she shouldn t buy the cute onesies with a thousand impossible buttons, or that she might cry more than the baby. Best-selling humor author Dawn Dais, mother to a one-year-old and author of The Nonrunner's Marathon Guide for Women , is convinced that there is a reason for this lack of preparedness. She believes that a vast conspiracy exists to hide the horrific truth about parenting from doe-eyed expectant mothers who might otherwise abandon their babies in hospitals and run for it. In The Sh!t No One Tells You , Dais tells it like it is, revealing what it s really like to be a new parent and providing helpful insights, humor, and hope for those who feel overwhelmed by the exhausting trials they re suddenly facing. Eschewing the adorableness that oozes out of other parenting books, Dais offers real advice from real moms along with hilarious anecdotes, clever tips, and the genuine encouragement every mom needs in order to survive the first year of parenthood.
