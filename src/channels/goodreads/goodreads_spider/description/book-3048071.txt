3048071:::::Kon-Tiki: Across the Pacific by Raft:::::"Kon-Tiki" is the record of an astonishing adventure - a journey 4,300 nautical miles across the Pacific Ocean by raft. Intrigued by Polynesian folklore, biologist Thor Heyerdahl suspected that the South Sea Islands had been settled by an ancient race from thousands of miles to the east, led by the mythical hero Kon-Tiki. He decided to prove his theory by duplicating the legendary voyage. On April 28, 1947, Heyerdahl and five other adventurers sailed from Peru on a balsa log raft. After three suspenseful months on the open sea, alone among raging storms, whales and countless sharks, they sighted land - the polynesian island of Puka Puka. Translated into 65 languages, read by millions all over the world, "Kon-Tiki" is a classic, inspiring tale of daring and courage - a magnificent saga of men against the sea.
