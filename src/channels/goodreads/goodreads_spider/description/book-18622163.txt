18622163:::::5 Days FREE of Depression Anxiety and Panic Attacks:::::As someone whose life has been focused on working in recovery, first within the medical system, and the last 25 years within LAMB Ministers (a work born of faith in the healing balm of Gods Word and prayer),I have never read anything so real, so riveting, so compelling as this small book is. From the moment I began, I realized that author Rhonda Patton's goal in sharing her journey from fright to light, from house bound to breaking free, from agony to peace in Christ was written for only one purpose, which we read in James 5:16, "...The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective," which is her heart cry so simply said, and I paraphrase. "That you would not have to go through what she did." I echo her concern and truly hope no mater whether you think your troubles or you are of no account, reading this book can begin your person journey to freedom. Paula Rose Michelson is the author of Casa de Naomi: The House of Blessing, Books 1&amp;2, and The Naomi Chronicles, Book One, Beginning Anew due to release February 2014.
