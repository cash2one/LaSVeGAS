45830:::::Quo Vadis:::::Rome during the reign of Nero was a glorious place for the emperor &amp; his court; there were grand feasts, tournaments for poets, &amp; exciting games &amp; circuses filling the days &amp; nights. The pageantry &amp; pretentious displays of excess were sufficient to cloy the senses of participants as well as to offend the sensitive. Petronius, a generous &amp; noble Roman, a man of the world much in favor at the court of Nero, is intrigued by a strange tale related by his nephew Marcus Vinitius of his encounter with a mysterious young woman called Ligia with whom Vinitius falls madly in love. Ligia, a captured King's daughter &amp; a one-time hostage of Rome, is now a foster child of a noble Roman household. She's also a Christian. The setting of the narrative was prepared with utmost care. Henryk Sienkiewicz visited the Roman settings many times &amp; was thoroughly educated in the historical background. As an attempt to create the spirit of antiquity, the novel met with unanimous acclaim, which earned the Nobel Prize in literature for the author in 1905. As a vision of ancient Rome &amp; early Christianity it hasn't yet been surpassed, over a century later.
