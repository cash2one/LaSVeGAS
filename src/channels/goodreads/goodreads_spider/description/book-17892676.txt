17892676:::::Tread of Death: Tragic End to Divine Favor:::::Tread of Death: Tragic End to Divine Favor - Dorothy Kardas, Psy.D. Th.D. Without God's Truth, which has supreme and transcendent importance, what is left, are deceptive versions of freedom, relativistic uncertainty, dubiety and skepticism, and hence there is no social conscience and sacred duties; social and political agenda serve selfish, private interests, and the logic of perverted authority, which hold spiritually most devastating, and permanent consequences. Society that accepts as true, false ideas, perversely and "unlimitedly" wanting with no regard for the judgment of the Just and Omniscient Judge, regresses rapidly and eventually disintegrates. All societies invariably plunge into an anarchic deviancy becoming rootless, arrogant or cowardly mob of ruinous loggerheads without obeisance to Perennial Truth. For, when the notion of changeless or ultimate Truth, and thus the concomitant existing absolute moral values are denied or repudiated, there is not only an intellectual and spiritual chaos, but modern democracy turns into a totalitarian and arbitrary form of government exercising centralized or absolute control over all aspects of life - evidenced in such abominable symptomatic realities as cruel destruction of preborn life, euthanasia, assisted suicide, In Vitro Fertilization, surrogate "motherhood," contraceptive mentality etc., as well as, the economic reality or the market comes to be a subject of idolatry by being radically and erroneously unconstrained. Acts of will and choices are authentically free only when they are not conformable and servile to vice, errors and imperfections. The one who willfully refuses to follow divine and therefore unerring and limitlessly beneficial orders is in essence practicing disloyalty and disobedience to oneself, and by habituating in sin destroys charity, which inevitably results in a gradual destruction of spiritual life - death of the soul.
