25378986:::::Love Always, Kate:::::Librarian's Note: This is an alternate/new cover for ASIN B00JGWV3WW . Dear Diary, Leukemia s been my life since I was eleven. Now, six years later, I want my life back. Only I m not sure what that is. The test results came back today. 22,000. Which means I m officially out of remission again. I have three options: 1) Another round of chemo. 2) A super-new experimental drug. 3) Dump it all forget the meds and treatments and enjoy the time I have left. I think I know what I want. Then, in walks Damian, changing everything. I mean, everything He s got his own set of issues. It binds us together, you know? We understand what it s like to lose what matters most in seconds. Still, the last thing I need is to have someone else to crush if I can t fight hard enough. And the last thing he needs is someone else to grieve. Never mind. I m down to two options now. Somehow I know that whichever one I choose, the result will be the same. With the sand in my hourglass seeping to the bottom, I hope there s enough left to show Damian that life s worth living. Worth fighting for. Worth dying for. Love Always, Kate
