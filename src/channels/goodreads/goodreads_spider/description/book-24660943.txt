24660943:::::47 Things:::::***CONTENT WARNING*** New Adult Standalone Romance for ages 18+ due to sex scenes and adult situations. "What's your name, sweetheart?".... That was the first thing. I wasn't his sweetheart, and he should have already known my name. But, that was the moment I became caught in Tyler Lohan's sight. He was wonderful and complicated, and I'd spent my life trying to hate him for being the golden boy who had everything so easy. However, as with all things, Tyler wasn t the person he appeared to be from the outside, and once I saw him the real him I fell, and I don t think I ever got back up. There would be a total of forty-seven things that sucked me into Tyler's life then forced me away. Forty-seven things that ruined me forever. Forty-seven was never going to be enough. There was no number great enough... 47 Things. A standalone new adult romance that follows a couple as they come to terms with falling love in a world they can't control, and the certainty of the inevitable.
