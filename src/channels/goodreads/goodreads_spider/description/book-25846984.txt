25846984:::::Never Satisfied:::::Ladies, what would you do if you found out that your best friend secretly wanted to be like you and was plotting to steal your man? Find out how Kyrielle handles this situation in this tantalizing read. It's a classic tale of lust, drama, drugs and war, but with a southern twist! Set in New Orleans, Louisiana, Never Satisfied is a story about envy and how it possesses the power to demolish anything standing in its path once one becomes consumed by it. Twenty-two year old Jasmine Harris learns this lesson the hard way when her covetousness for the lavish life style of her best friend, Kyrielle, spirals out of control. Just when Jasmine thinks she has reached the pinnacle of the status that she has underhandedly worked so hard to obtain, she finds out that nothing is what it seems and ends up tangled in a huge web of deceit that results in bloodshed. Although Never Satisfied is filled with action, suspense and a bit of erotica, it also carries a sympathetic undertone that touches on youth abandonment and the role it plays in the development of those affected by it.
