In his first year there, Will is chasing his dream of eventually playing in the NFL. His hopes all ride on the team's star receiver who goes by the name of Machete. Machete has caught the NFL scouts' attention and is projected to go high in the draft after his senior season. As Machete is all but guaranteed a spot in the NFL, Will pins his hopes on one of the scouts taking notice of him during practice and remembering him come draft day. But Will's hopes and dreams are about to be shattered. One night during an off campus incident, Will and some of his teammates go to some nearby apartments to help a teammate who is in a confrontation with Machete and some of his gang members. As words are exchanged between the football team and the gang, a gun is brought out and Will is shot nine times on Machete's orders, and left to die. Will is fortunate enough to survive the attack but his football days at Delaware state are over. Will returns home and starts the recovery process. As for Machete, he accepts a plea deal and serves six months in prison. Will fights daily with his anger and thoughts of revenge, reliving that fateful night in his dreams over and over. Six years later, Machete is out of prison, with a book deal from a major publisher about his life and an upcoming movie in the works. Both the book and the movie based on it are titled War of the Bloods in My Veins. But what about Will? Can he move past his lost dreams to offer his former friend forgiveness...or will he seek revenge for the night that changed everything?
