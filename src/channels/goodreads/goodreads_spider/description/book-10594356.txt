10594356:::::Going Vintage:::::When Mallory s boyfriend, Jeremy, cheats on her with an online girlfriend, Mallory decides the best way to de-Jeremy her life is to de-modernize things too. Inspired by a list of goals her grandmother made in 1962, Mallory swears off technology and returns to a simpler time (when boyfriends couldn t cheat with computer avatars). The List: 1. Run for pep club secretary 2. Host a fancy dinner party/soiree 3. Sew a dress for Homecoming 4. Find a steady 5. Do something dangerous But simple proves to be crazy-complicated, and the details of the past begin to change Mallory s present. Add in a too-busy grandmother, a sassy sister, and the cute pep-club president who just happens to be her ex s cousin and soon Mallory begins to wonder if going vintage is going too far.
