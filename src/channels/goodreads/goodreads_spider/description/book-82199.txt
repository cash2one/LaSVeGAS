82199:::::The Five Fingers:::::They were seven men - crack special service operatives. They were to have no military support, no radio contact, nothing to rely on but their expertise in small arms and explosives. There was to be no capture, no surrender. Alone in the steamy jungles of Laos and Vietnam, they knew that once in China they were on their own. There would be no rescue operation... If it's fiction it's unbelievably harrowing. If it's fact it's incredibly terrifying. "There is more killing here than in a Chicago stockyard... For a look at the soldier in excelsis, The Five Fingers will be hard to beat." - The New York Times
