18513789:::::Early Days:::::Darussalam is proud to present the abridged English translation of the classic work. The book starts by describing the beginning of creation - from the Throne and the Kursi, the Universe and all that is in it, such as the angels, the Jinn and humans. The book also recounts stories from the lives of the Prophets and their nations, up to the times of the Children of Isra'eel and the Days of Ignorance, which ended with the advent of the final Prophet, Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him). Al-Bidayah wan Nihayah (The Beginning and The End) by the renowned scholar Abu Al-Fida, 'Imad ad-Deen Isma'eel bin 'Umar bin Katheer (Ibn Katheer), is considered one of the most authoritative sources on Islamic history. A unique feature of the book is that it not only deals with past events, but also talks about future events mentioned by Prophet Muhammad (peace and blessings be upon him) until the Day of Judgment.
