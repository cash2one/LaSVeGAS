21438744:::::Late Call:::::She s a high class call girl. He s taking over his father s business. Seven years ago, they fell in love in Paris. They walked away at the end of the summer, never imagining they d meet again. Now he s her client. We fell in love the way you jump from a cliff. Hard and fast with a reckless sense of abandon. The six weeks we spent together changed my life, but at seventeen, I was naive. I was a dreamer. A believer. Now I m twenty-four and cynical. I don t believe in love. There s no place for such emotions as a high class escort. The only things I m allowed to feel are physical and that s why it s so damn hard when the client of a last minute job turns out to be the man I left in France seven years ago. When he buys me for six weeks at triple my rate, my agent makes it clear I have no choice but to take the job despite our previous relationship. And my heart makes it very clear I have to stay firmly on top of the cliff this time. Because for six weeks, I once again belong to Aaron Stone.
