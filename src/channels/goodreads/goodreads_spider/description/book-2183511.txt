2183511:::::Epitaph of a Small Winner:::::In these memoirs, Braz Cubas, a wealthy nineteenth-century Brazilian, examines (from beyond the grave) his rather undistinguished life in 160 short chapters that are filled with philosophical digressions and exuberant insights. A clear forerunner of Gabriel Garc a M rquez and Jorge Luis Borges, Epitaph for a Small Winner , first published in 1880, is one of the wittiest self-portraits in literary history as well as one of the masterpieces of Brazilian literature (Salman Rushdie).
