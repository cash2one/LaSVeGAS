1022228:::::The Curse of the Witch-Queen:::::The place is the House of Obran. In the House of Szar, Zargal was supposed to uphold it's dignity because he's the son of the Duke. He insults King Laza and gets the curse of gluttony, meaning he can't stop eating. He then tries to seek pardon and help from King Laza, but he runs into another curse King Laza was under because of the ancient Queen Godescalc which twisted Laza and is now in the process of destroying Princess Bellora. To save the princess and himself, he must go to a swamp filled with horror where the queen fled. Impossible? Maybe, especially because Queen Godescalc was under a subtle and fearful curse herself. Who cast that curse? Will he have to go to that person for help? Is that person cursed as well? Find out in the book.
