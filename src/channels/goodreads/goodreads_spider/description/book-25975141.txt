25975141:::::Dragon of Legend: Destiny: Fantasy Dragon Adventure:::::For over a thousand years, the Lands have been under the mercy of ruthless evil rider Haiden and his ferocious black dragon. They rule with an iron fist, promising riches only to those who swear blind loyalty to them but certain death to those who would dare defy their authority. Every hundred years, however, a Rider and Dragon of Legend emerge and attempt to defeat Haiden and his dragon but so far, not one has succeeded. This time, Akira, an untrained and inexperienced girl of sixteen summers, is chosen by the new Dragon of Legend, as his rider. Together, the two find themselves thrust into a fate many see as a lost cause challenging the most powerful rider and dragon in the realm. With all odds seemingly stacked against them, will Akira and her dragon prevail or will they share the same fate as all the other Riders and Dragons of Legend before them? If you loved the fun and adventure of How to Train Your Dragon as well as smart-mouthed creatures, and good triumphing over evil, then Angelika Meyer's Dragon of Legend: Destiny is a book that will definitely tickle your fancy.
