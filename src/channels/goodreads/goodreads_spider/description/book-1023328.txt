1023328:::::The Key to the Golden Firebird:::::The funny thing about stop signs is that they're also start signs. Mayzie is the brainy middle sister, Brooks is the beautiful but conflicted oldest, and Palmer's the quirky baby of the family. In spite of their differences, the Gold sisters have always been close.

Together, they discover the key to moving on -- and it's the key to their father's Pontiac Firebird..
