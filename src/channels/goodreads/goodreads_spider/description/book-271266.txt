271266:::::Bleach, Volume 05:::::Right Arm of the Giant Ichigo Kurosaki thought that Soul Reapers were the only ones hunting Hollows, but he was wrong. Enter Ury Ishida, a Quincy, and possibly the last member of a powerful clan that died out over 200 years ago. Unlike Soul Reapers who strive to cleanse Hollows of their sins and send them to the Soul Society, Quincies adopt a more direct approach - they kill Hollows without hesitation. To demonstrate the supremacy of the Quincies' ways, Ury challenges Ichigo to a contest - bait is spread around the city, attracting a large number of unstable Hollows. Whoever defeats the most wins, regardless of the danger. Also, Orihime and Chad, confronted with a host of Hollows terrorizing their friends, awaken to their own psychic abilities. Who is the strongest? Find this out and more in the action-packed fifth volume of Tite Kubo's Bleach !
