17777989:::::Poached:::::Teddy Fitzroy s back for another zoo mystery this time it s a koala caper in this action-packed follow-up to Belly Up, which Kirkus Reviews called great fun. School troublemaker Vance Jessup thinks Teddy Fitzroy s home at FunJungle, a state-of-the-art zoo and theme park, is the perfect place for a cruel prank. Vance bullies Teddy into his scheme, but the plan goes terribly awry. Teddy sneaks into the koala exhibit to hide out until the chaos dies down. But when the koala goes missing, Teddy is the only person caught on camera entering and exiting the exhibit. Teddy didn t commit the crime but if he can t find the real culprit, he ll be sent to juvie as a convicted koala-napper.
