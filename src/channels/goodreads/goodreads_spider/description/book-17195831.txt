17195831:::::Villains Rising:::::Alex Knight struggles to find a place between superheroes and supervillains in this explosive sequel to The Cloak Society, which School Library Journal praised as having "the same wide appeal as Rick Riordan's Percy Jackson books." The Cloak Society has finally taken down their greatest enemies-the Rangers of Justice-in a spectacular feat of supervillainy, and their long-awaited rise to power is imminent. But twelve-year-old Alex Knight has other plans-he has joined forces with Kirbie and the Junior Rangers of Justice to fight Cloak once and for all. But fighting for the same side is easier said than done...especially when your new teammates aren't sure your days as a supervillain are over. Packed with intense battles, extraordinary superpowers, and life-changing decisions, The Cloak Society is a thrilling middle-grade trilogy that turns everything you know about superheroes on its head-and in Villains Rising, the stakes are even higher. Fans of The 39 Clues and the Alex Rider Adventures will be hooked!
