595405:::::Heart's Delight:::::Before Heart's Delight, I was a boy, he thinks. Before Heart's Delight, I was a child When he first saw Ann-Katrin on the bus, he was mesmerized, captivated, consumed. But that was before. Now he sits alone in his room, a sixteen-year-old boy, waiting for her to call. Wishing for her to tell him it was real. It was as perfect as he imagined. But the phone sits silently. The boy continues to wait, systematically destroying all of the objects from their short-lived relationship. He rips up the bus pass from their first meeting. The phone is quiet. He throws the pot of lemon balm she gave him over the edge of the balcony. No phone call. He tosses the black Frisbee and the Swiss Army knife over too. Still the phone stays silent. As he plays their relationship over in his mind like a movie, he wonders: What if his heart's delight doesn't call? Will life be worth living then?
