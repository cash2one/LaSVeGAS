11699323:::::Freshman Year & Other Unnatural Disasters:::::Kelsey Finkelstein is fourteen and FRUSTRATED. Every time she tries to live up to her awesome potential, her plans are foiled by her impossible parents, her annoying little sister, and life in general. But with her first day of high school coming up, Kelsey is positive that things are going to change. Enlisting the help of her three best friends sweet and quiet Em, theatrical Cass, and wild JoJo Kelsey gets ready to rebrand herself and make the kind of mark she knows is her destiny. Things start out great - her arch-nemesis has moved across the country, giving Kelsey the perfect opportunity to stand out on the soccer team and finally catch the eye of her long-time crush. But soon enough, an evil junior s thirst for revenge, a mysterious photographer, and a series of other catastrophes make it clear that just because KELSEY has a plan for greatness it doesn t mean the rest of the world is in on it. Kelsey s hilarious commentary throughout her disastrous freshman year will have you laughing out loud while being thankful that you re not in her shoes, of course
