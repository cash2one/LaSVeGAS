54215:::::Mara and Dann:::::The Barnes &amp; Noble Review An emotionally involving science-fantasy novel with a focus on history and sociological relevance, Mara and Dann is Doris Lessing's return to magic realism after a number of autobiographies and books of essays. As with most of her work, this tale is set in Africa (now known as Ifrik) but several thousand years in the future. Mara and Dann is a strange and powerful parable concerned with both mankind's usual foibles and great shifts in the environment, any of which might spell doom for the human race.
