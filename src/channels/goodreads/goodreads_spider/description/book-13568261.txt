13568261:::::Me and Her: a Memoir Of Madness:::::Me And Her: A Memoir of Madness reveals how Karen Tyrrell, a dedicated Australian teacher is repeatedly harassed by parents at her school to breaking point and beyond. In a fit of desperation, she escapes and runs. Police and medical professionals discover her hiding in a lonely motel, forcing her into the frightening world of the psychiatric system. The reader is taken back to the classroom, discovering how the harassment affected Karen as we journey through her gradual decline and disintegration leading to her incarceration. Later Karen performs an 'experiment', purposefully stressing over a disturbed student, keeping herself awake at night - all in order to kick-start the creative ideas she craves. Karen reveals her psychic relationship with her psychologist, her pitch-black manic dreams and her two personas: me-wife, mother, writer and teacher, her-manic, psychic, healer to the living, telepathic to the dead, and she's very psychotic. Why did she become so crazy? How did she claw her way back from Insanity?
