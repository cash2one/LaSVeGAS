9466892:::::Genie in Training:::::Poppy is just your normal, average, every day, ordinary girl. She isn t the best at school or at sports, and her most remarkable talents are squeezing into tight places and touching her nose with her tongue. This is why Poppy never expects that on her 12th birthday, she will learn something perfectly extraordinary. She is a genie! But genie privileges, such as living in a bottle and granting wishes, don t come automatically. Poppy must pass all of her classes at Tweenie Genie School and manage to keep her new identity a complete and total secret. Training to be a genie is hard work. Can Poppy do it?
