Santa still sitting on the roof in May? The home office swallows up whole rooms, as does the family computer station. Then there are the cell phone chargers, the remotes, and the play areas, not to mention our collections -- books, DVDs, toys, magazines. Time management experts agree that when the minor things that take up space in the mind are eliminated, there is room to think about the big things. The same goes for the home.
