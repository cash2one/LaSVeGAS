His mum has died and he misses her all the more now he and Dad have moved in with Ashley and her mum. Meet Ashley. She s popular, cool and sees things very differently to her new family. Her dad has come out and moved out but not far enough. And now she has to live with a freakazoid step-brother.

And things are about to get a whole lot more mixed up when these two very different people attract the attention of school hunk Jared. . .
