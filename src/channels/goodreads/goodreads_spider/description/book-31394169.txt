Shy Rose dreams of wild adventures-- gunfights and moonlit chase scenes--and the day when she can sell her novels to make enough to support her family. But her writing reflects her lack of experience, and she's determined to find a way to learn about the grittier side of life. So when a wounded outlaw shows up in her barn two weeks before Christmas, the opportunity is too good to pass up. While she nurses him, Rose can learn from his escapades... but how long will she remain unaffected by his dangerous good looks? US Marshall Barrett "Bear" Faulker might look like a dangerous bandit, but he can't give away his real identity until he knows that the gang who attacked him is behind bars. He needs to keep his distance from his beautiful young savior, but her winning smile and her probing questions about his life and missions makes him defenseless against her charms. And when the gang decides that Everland's Christmas celebrations are an easy target, Bear realizes that he'll do just about anything to save the woman he's come to love.
