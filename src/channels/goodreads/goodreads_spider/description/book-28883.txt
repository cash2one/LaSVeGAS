28883:::::The Lamb's Supper: The Mass as Heaven on Earth:::::The Lamb's Supper reveals a long-lost secret of the Church: the early Christian's key to understanding the mysteries of the Mass was the New Testament's Book of Revelation. With its bizarre imagery, its mystic visions of Heaven, and its end-of-time prophecies, Revelation mirrors the sacrifice and celebration of the Eucharist. Beautifully written in clear, direct language, this new book by bestselling Catholic author Scott Hahn will help readers see the Mass with new eyes, pray the liturgy with a renewed heart, and enter into the Mass more fully, enthusiastically, intelligently, and powerfully than ever before. Dr. Scott Hahn is currently Professor of Theology and Scripture at Franciscan University of Steubenville, Ohio. He is also the founder and Director of the Institute of Applied Biblical Studies, and serves as President for the Missionaries of Faith Foundation. He is married to Kimberly. They have six children.
