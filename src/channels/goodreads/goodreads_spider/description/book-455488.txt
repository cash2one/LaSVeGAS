455488:::::History and Utopia:::::In this book, Cioran writes of politics, of history, and of the utopian dream. "A small masterwork . . . a stringent examination of some persistent and murky notions in human history. . . . It is best to read Cioran while sitting. The impact upon the intellect can be temporarily stunning, and motor systems may give way under the assault." Joseph Patrick Kennedy, Houston Chronicle "Cioran has a claim to be regarded as among the handful of original minds . . . writing today." New York Times "A sort of final philosopher of the Western world. [Cioran's] statements have the compression of poetry and the audacity of cosmic clowning." Washington Post E. M. Cioran (1911-1995) was born and educated in Romania and lived in Paris from 1937 until his death. He is the author of numerous works, including On the Heights of Despair , also available from the University of Chicago Press.
