There was an enemy within. It was the secret services of the British state, operating inside the NUM itself. Milne revealed for the first time the astonishing lengths to which the government and its intelligence machine were prepared to go to destroy the power of Britain s miners union. Using phoney bank deposits, staged cash drops, forged documents, agents provocateurs and unrelenting surveillance, M15 and police Special Branch set out to discredit Scargill and other miners leaders. Planted tales of corruption were seized on by the media and both Tory and Labour politicians in what became an unprecedentedly savage smear campaign. In this new edition, published for the twentieth anniversary of Britain s most important postwar social confrontation, new material brings the story up to date and, in the wake of the Iraq war intelligence scandals, highlights the continuing threat posed by the security services to democracy today.
