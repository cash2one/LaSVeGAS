182332:::::The Blue Girl:::::Seventeen-year-old Imogene's tough, rebellious nature has caused her more harm than good so when her family moves to Newford, she decides to reinvent herself. She won't lose her punk/thrift-shop look, but she'll try to avoid the gangs, work a little harder at school, and maybe even stay out of trouble for a change. Maxine is Imogene's exact opposite. Everyone considers Maxine a straight-A loser, but as Imogene soon learns, it's Maxine's overprotective mother whose rules about clothes and curfews make it impossible for her to speak up for her true self. Oddly, the friendship works. Imogene helps Maxine loosen up, and in turn, Maxine keeps Imogene in line. But trouble shows up anyway. Imogene quickly catches the eye of Redding's A-list bullies, as well as the school's resident teen ghost. Then she gets on the wrong side of a gang of malicious fairies. When her imaginary childhood friend Pelly shows up, Imogene realises that the impossible is all too real - and all too dangerous. If she wants to survive high school not to mention stay alive she has to fall back on the skills she picked up in her hometown. Even with Maxine and some unexpected allies by her side, will she be able to make it?
