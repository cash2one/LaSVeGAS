8163553:::::The God Virus: How religion infects our lives and culture:::::Dawkins, Hitchens, Harris and Dennett opened the door to a hard nosed look at religion in our society but no one seemed to be using their concepts to explain the psychology of religion and its practical effects on people. Dr. Darrel Ray, psychologist and lifelong student of religion stepped into this gap to discuss religious infection from the inside out. How does guilt play into religious infection? Why is sexual control so important to so many religions? What causes the anxiety and neuroticism around death and dying? How does religion inject itself into so many areas of life, culture and politics? Dr. Ray explores this and much more in his book, The God Virus: How religion infects our lives and culture. This second generation book takes the reader several steps beyond Dawkins, et al. into the realm of the personal and emotional mechanisms that affect anyone who lives in a culture steeped in religion. He uses examples that anyone can relate to and gives real world guidance in how to deal with and respond to people who are religious among our families, friends and coworkers.
