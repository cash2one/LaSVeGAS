19181243:::::Child Witch Kinshasa:::::Congolese street kid seeks home. Foreign journalist wants to help. The devil is in the detail. A tale of travel, love and loss, Mike Ormsby's first novel is published in two volumes - 'Child Witch Kinshasa' and 'Child Witch London' - by Nicoaro Books. Child Witch Kinshasa: It s spring 2002 and Frank Kean is training journalists in troubled Congo. When he learns that religious zealots are torturing and murdering so-called child witches, his reporter's instincts kick in. Why so little news coverage of these 'exorcisms'? He is determined to break the silence. In a remote village, Pastor Precious arrives to battle Satan. Twelve-year-old Dudu faces a torrent of accusations and is forced to flee, far from home. He swears he is not a witch, but evidence suggests otherwise. When Frank meets Dudu in Kinshasa, he sees an opportunity to help the sceptical street kid, even if it means crossing the line and making promises he may be unable to keep. Can they trust each other, in a crisis? Superstition and fear play out against a bloody and relentless civil war. The story continues in 'Child Witch London'(March 2014).
