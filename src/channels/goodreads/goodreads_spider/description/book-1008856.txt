1008856:::::Our Story: 77 Hours That Tested Our Friendship and Our Faith:::::The entire nation stopped and held its collective breath as word spread of the plight of the nine Pennsylvania coal miners who were trapped underground for 77 hours. Now, for the first time, the miners tell their own story--in a dramatic, riveting first-person account of their actions and emotions and of how they managed to make it through the traumatic accident and rescue. The men were below ground when water trapped in an adjacent mine burst through the wall of the new mine they were working. Scrambling to avoid the sluicing tide that rapidly rose in the narrow passageway, the crew knew they were in serious trouble. Moe, who was trapped on the other side of the raging stream, alone and away from the others, thought he would die then and there. However, in a heroic effort, Randly Fogle, crew chief, drove the scoop machinery straight into the flood and Moe managed to leap into it, and thus was carried to relative safety. Now all together, the miners moved to the best location they could find in the freezing-cold, still-rising water. They recount their fears, their prayers, their confessions to one another, and how they kept up their hope that they'd get out alive, while trying to decide how to drown with dignity. Meanwhile, we see the agony their wives, girlfriends, and families were going through, not knowing if they were living or dead. Once a resuce was imminent, the men reveal how they decided who would be the last man up. And they tell of their emotions upon finally touching solid ground and meeting their loved ones, whom they'd thought they would never see again. The successful rescue of the miners lifted the spirits of an entire nation. Now everyone can read the complete story of this harrowing incident--how these men and their families had the strength, courage, and faith to endure their incredible ordeal.
