104447:::::The Journals of Rachel Scott: A Journey of Faith at Columbine High:::::Written teen to teen as a first-person narrative, this is not a book about the Columbine shootings - instead, it's a story of faith, told in Rachel's own words. The book includes first person narratives, journal entries, drawings from Rachel's diary, and notes from her parents and friends at Columbine High School. Additionally, "me pages" (what makes me angry, what I'm aftraid of) encourage teens to explore issues central to their lives and faith. Highlighting Rachel's faith journey from the time she became a Christian, through her joys and doubts, her hopes and dreams, this story is a triumphant testimony that teens will treasure.
