16106444:::::Santa's Executive:::::Justin Cooper wasn t always the straight-laced Holiday Elementary School principal. In his youth, he broke all the rules and enjoyed being the bad Cooper brother. One Christmas Eve night he got a little too rowdy and things changed forever. Now the consequences of that fateful night have come back in full force and the myths of Christmas might be more real than he thought. Rina Brewer is one of Santa s elves. Not the tiny cute little toy maker, but the sexy, petite, energy filled bombshell kind. She s come to Holiday to aid Justin in his new role as Santa s executive, but as soon as she sees the sexy ex-bad boy, she realizes the job may be more than she bargained for. As they work together to make this Christmas one to remember, an old foe has come to town to make sure that this holiday is the coldest yet. Warning: Contains a perky elf who dreams of something more, a Christmas myth who may be a baddie, and a sexy ex-bad boy who craves Christmas cookies and a certain perky blonde.
