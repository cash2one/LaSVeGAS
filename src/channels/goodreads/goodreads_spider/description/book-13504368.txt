13504368:::::Hell's Gate:::::The gates of hell are open. Angels and Demons fight for our mortality and dominance of earth. The rapture diminishes the human population and very few remain to defend what God gave us. It is up to the angels to fight the war, the humans to survive and the druids to protect the earth. Cole wants nothing more than to be left alone until the war is over and see who wins. He doesn't care for rules of any kind and least of all to choose a side. Fate however has different plans for him. His only friend is being held hostage by a demon with a plan to win the war and return the earth to what it once was. It is up to him to rescue her with the help of a fallen angel who comes to his aid to ensure his survival. The druids are the only ones who can save his friend but have an agenda of their own. The demon is demented but has the best intentions for what she believes. Cole finds his self lusting after the fallen angel and must choose between her and saving his friend. The problem is that he doesn't know who he can trust to make sure everyone comes out alive. Armageddon is here and where will our souls go; heaven, hell or return to the earth? The only thing known for sure is Cole will die to know the answer.
