I was totally hooked ..." - THIS KID REVIEWS BOOKS A simple day at the museum turns into to an edge-of-your-seat roller-coaster ride into the past. A museum Mummy in deep distress recruits JJ Sterling, and his best buddy, Linc, to head back in time to Ancient Egypt. Along with new pal, Rani, it's up to the three of them to locate the mysterious Golden Scarab and save history. A long-time feud between two ancient brothers, Seth and Horus, looks set to end the fragile peace in Egypt. It's time for our young heroes to rise up and conquer evil. Their perilous quest leads them on a race through scorching deserts, and temples full of amazing hidden chambers that are bursting with unexpected traps. All the while, an army of living statues called Uberdiles are determined to stop them. If the three kids fail, the impact on the future would be a disaster for everyone ... including you. Once you've caught your breath, you'll be busting to get your teeth into The Cursed Nile (Quest 2), The Fallen Pharaoh (Quest 3), and The Missing Link (Quest 4 - due in early 2015).
