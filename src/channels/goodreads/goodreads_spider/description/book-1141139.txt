1141139:::::Out of the Ashes:::::On New Year's Day Becky Morley begins to write her diary. By March, her world has changed forever. Foot and mouth disease breaks out on a pig farm hundreds of miles from the Morley's Devon home, but soon the nightmare is a few fields away. Local sheep are infected and every animal is destroyed. Will the Morley's flock be next? Will their pedigree diary herd, the sows with their piglets, and Little Josh, Becky's hand-reared lamb, survive? Or will they be slaughtered too? The waiting and hoping is the most agonizing experience of Becky's life.
