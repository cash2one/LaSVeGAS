91777:::::Scandalous Lovers:::::Frances Hart spent her life as a devoted wife and mother. Now, newly widowed, she is determined to discover all Victorian London has to offer and to experience real passion for the first time. Acclaimed barrister James Whitcox knows no equal among his peers, but he also knows there's more to life than professional expertise and duty. He is determined to be equally versed in the pleasures of the flesh. To that end, he joins the very secret Men and Women's Club, an exclusive society founded to examine and explore the many aspects of human sexuality. And when their paths cross, Frances's honesty and need inspire James to action: Together they will tutor each other in physical desire, in passion and in love.
