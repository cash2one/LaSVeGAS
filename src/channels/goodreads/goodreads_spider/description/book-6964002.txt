6964002:::::Witch of the Glens:::::The time was 1644 in Inverness, Scotland. As the "wicked wee lass" raced along the steep streets, just ahead of the stones and cries of briosag! hurled at her, she wished with all her heart that she were a witch. What a spell she would put on them all! For all her seventeen years, Kelpie could remember nothing but belonging to Mina and Bogle, gypsies who lived by their evil wits. The only law any of them knew was that of self-preservation. Bogle said she had been kidnaped because of her blue ringed eyes of the "Second Sight," and she often wondered from where. A castle, perhaps? Nobility? But a series of events would change her life forever when Kelpie would encounter two fine young men. A hands-down favorite of Sally Watson readers!
