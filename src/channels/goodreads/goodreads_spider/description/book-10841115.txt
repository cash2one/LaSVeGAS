10841115:::::Kiss of Night:::::As Susan Lambert prays at an ancient church while visiting Prague for her beloved grandmother's funeral, she is suddenly confronted by a man who vanishes as quickly as he appeared. She dismisses him as a figment of her imagination, only to meet him again shortly after her cousin disappears with a stranger. His name is Raphael and he claims her cousin is in mortal danger. By accepting his help, Susan finds herself thrust into a world of the supernatural. Raphael, once a brutal knight who fought during the Crusades, was cursed for his sins to roam the earth as a vampire. Now he claims to need Susan's help in a secret war against a sinister evil. Unsure of a world she could never have believed existed and entangled with forces beyond her control, Susan must trust the mesmerising Raphael to lead her through to the other side safely. Both Susan and Raphael will be called upon to exercise courage and faith, and in the process, the question What would happen if a vampire truly accepted God? is answered.
