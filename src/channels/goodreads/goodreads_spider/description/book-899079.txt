899079:::::Prince Ombra:::::The World has found its new hero. The problem? Bentley Ellicott is only a kid. Bentley has secret powers. And he's going to need them. Bentley is a hero - the thousand and first to be exact - in a long line of heroes that has stretched all the way back to antiquity. Heroes like Arthur and Hercules. And now: Bentley. That's because there is an evil in the world that never dies. Its name is Prnce Ombra. When Prince Ombra arises a hero is called upon to battle him. One day when Bentley is grown he will be that hero. What Bentley doesn't know is that his "one day" is today.
