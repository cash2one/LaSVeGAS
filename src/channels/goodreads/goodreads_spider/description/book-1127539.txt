1127539:::::Out of my Comfort Zone: The Autobiography:::::Rarely does a truly great player reveal as much of himself and his sport as does Steve Waugh in his long awaited autobiography. "Out of my Comfort Zone" is a frank look into a unique life in cricket, a journey into Waugh's life on and off the field. He opens up on his personal life in a way few would expect and reveals the controversies and scandals, the clashes with other players, the media and the cricket administrators. He also offers honest and perceptive portraits of many of the people who have shared his adventure. Many of the photographs included in the book were taken by Waugh, providing a rare peek behind the dressing room door as well as reflecting his passion for travelling.
