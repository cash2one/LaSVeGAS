26119570:::::Mack:::::"THEY THINK KING IS EVIL, BUT HE'S GOT NOTHING ON ME." -Mack MY NAME IS MACK. And if I play my cards right, I will soon be dead. Permanently. Not even my powerful twin brother will be able to resurrect me. A good thing. Because a man like me has no business living. Not when I have killed. Not when I have betrayed everyone I have ever cared for. Not when I know I'm destined to do it again. This is why I have come looking for her--the only one capable of ending me once and for all. But will she think I'm just another insane patient? Or will she believe the truth? I am thousands of years old, my heart too dark to be salvaged. And my name isn't really Mack. ~~~ MY NAME IS TEDDI, short for Theodora. My entire life has been a canvas of grays, whites, and black. I can't feel, I can't understand joy, I've never truly lived. Until now. His name is Mack, and though he believes he's cursed, my degree in psychology tells me otherwise. Besides, someone who's capable of bringing so much light into my life can't be anything but good. But I can save him. If he'll let me.
