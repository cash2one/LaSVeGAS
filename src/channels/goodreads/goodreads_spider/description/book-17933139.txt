17933139:::::Love Me If You Dare:::::Some things change... It s been three years since Kaylee Sawyer has been home home to the alcoholic mother she can t handle, home to the painful memories of her sister Ella... and home to the guilt she s carried for years. About to enter her final year of college, she is determined to come to terms with the mess of her past and to ignore the guy whose single kiss has been tattooed into her mind forever. Some things stay the same... Dylan McKay is still golden haired and dangerous, the flame Kaylee was always afraid to touch for fear of getting burnt. But despite the damage that s been done, she finds that she still can t stay away from the one person who accepted her the way she was. Some things are meant to be. Kaylee is no longer the innocent girl she once was. Though tragedy ripped them apart before, one look from Dylan brings all of the old feelings rushing back. Torn between her past and her future, she s not sure if a person can ever truly go home again. But Dylan doesn t plan to let her go without a fight.
