88009:::::Druids:::::Mine was the vast dark sky and the spaces between the stars that called out to me; mine was the promise of magic. So spoke the young Celt Ainvar, centuries before the enchanted age of Arthur and Merlin. An orphan taken in by the chief druid of the Carnutes in Gaul, Ainvar possessed talents that would lead him to master the druid mysteries of thought, healing, magic, and battle talents that would make him a soul friend to the Prince Vercingetorix . . . though the two youths were as different as fire and ice. Yet Ainvar s destiny lay with Vercingetorix, the sun-bright warrior-king. Together they traveled through bitter winters and starlit summers in Gaul, rallying the splintered Celtic tribes against the encroaching might of Julius Caesar and the soulless legions of Rome. . . .
