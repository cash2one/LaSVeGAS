294817:::::Lucas:::::Lucas, the dramatic story of a young woman's encounter with the ugly side of humanity and her struggle to defeat it. British novelist Kevin Brooks's masterpiece is set on the island community of Hale over one summer, as 15-year-old Caitlin McCann realizes her small world is changing. Her brother is acting strangely, hanging out with the neighborhood reprobates and getting drunk, and her best friend follows his lead. To make matters worse, the son of an influential local has begun making lewd advances. And Caitlin feels she has no one in whom to confide: Her mother died in a car accident years ago, and her father, though loving and supportive, is a writer who spends much of his time holed up in his study. It's in this confusing context that Caitlin encounters Lucas, a lean, blond, blue-eyed stranger who mysteriously appears on the island. Caitlin feels drawn to him, but the other local kids are not: they call him a gypsy, and even throw rocks at him. Before long, Lucas is accused of a crime he did not commit, and Caitlin finds herself in a moral quandary. Lucas is filled with the kind of pain, love, and anguish that teenage readers adore. And Caitlin's quest to find her place in the world and to determine what's right is a struggle to which every teenager will relate. Why not start your own parent/teen book club with Lucas? Neither of you will be disappointed. ( Summer 2003 Selection )
