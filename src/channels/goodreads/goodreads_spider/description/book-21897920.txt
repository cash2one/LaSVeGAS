21897920:::::Dead Girls Society:::::You are cordially invited to participate in a game of thrills and dares. Tell no one, and come alone. If you dare. Hope is sick of everyone treating her like she s breakable. Sure, she has cystic fibrosis (basically really bad lungs), but she s tired of being babied by her mom and her overprotective best friend, Ethan, not to mention worrying about paying for her expensive medication and how she s going to afford college. And she s bored with life in her run-down New Orleans suburb. When an invitation arrives from a mysterious group that calls itself the Society, Hope jumps at the chance for some excitement. This could be her ticket out. All she has to do is complete a few dares and she might win some real money. But the Society isn t all it seems . . . and soon Hope finds that playing the game isn t a choice it s a requirement.
