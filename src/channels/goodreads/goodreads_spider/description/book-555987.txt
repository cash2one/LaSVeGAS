555987:::::A Version of the Truth:::::In Literacy and Longing in L.A. , hailed as the most delightful read of the year by Liz Smith in the New York Post, authors Jennifer Kaufman and Karen Mack captivated readers with a brilliantly imagined first novel. Now Kaufman and Mack return, introducing a character with a unique voice you ll never forget: Cassie Shaw, an irrepressible young woman who reinvents herself with unexpected consequences in a funny, wise, and utterly original novel about friendship, love, wildlife, and other forces of nature. In the wilds of Topanga Canyon, Cassie is right at home with the call of birds, the sound of wind in the trees, the harmony of a world without people. But everywhere else, life is a little harder for Cassie. Her mother believes in Big Foot. Her wisecracking pet parrot is a drama queen. And at the age of thirty, newly single and without a college degree, Cassie desperately needs a decent paycheck. Which is why, against all her principles, she lies on her r sum for an office job at an elite university and then finds herself employed in academia by two professors who are as rare as the birds she covets. One of her new bosses is Professor William Conner, a sexy, handsome, cheerfully aristocratic expert in animal behavior. Soon, under Conner s charismatic tutelage, Cassie carefully begins her personal transformation while meeting the kind of people who don t flock to wildlife preserves from impossibly brilliant academics to adorably spoiled college boys. But her future and unlikely new career is teetering on one unbearable untruth. And Cassie s masquerade is about to come undone in a chain of events that will transform her life and the lives of those around her forever. A novel for late bloomers of every exotic shade and stripe , A Version of the Truth is pure entertainment at once hilarious and wry, lyrical and uplifting. From the Hardcover edition.
