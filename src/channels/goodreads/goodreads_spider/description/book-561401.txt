But when Dean Marymount announces that someone is going to be held responsible for burning down the antique red barn, and expelled from Waverly Academy, the heat is really on. Tensions are rising, rumours are flying, and pretty soon everyone is a suspect. But was it Julian, Jenny's shaggy-haired new crush, whose engraved Tiffany lighter was found at the scene of the crime? Or could it have been Callie and Easy who were in the barn together when the blaze began?
