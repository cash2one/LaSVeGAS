298019:::::G-Spot: An Urban Erotic Tale:::::Her man demanded loyalty, but her body wouldn t obey. Have you ever rolled over in the middle of the night and realized you were doing things you swore you d never do? Sexing brothers you vowed you d never touch? Bending backwards and stooping lower than you ever thought you d stoop? Well if you can feel me even a little bit, then let me hit you with a story that just might blow your mind. . . . Nineteen-year-old Juicy Stanfield is the sexy young girlfriend of Granite G McKay, owner of Harlem s notorious G-Spot Social Club. A drug dealer with a lethal streak, he runs Harlem with an iron fist. But even the cash and the bling can t keep Juicy from getting restless, and while G fulfills her every material desire, she s burning up with unrequited sexual energy. To cheat on him would mean a death sentence; so Juicy finds pleasure in secret ways: fantasizing on crowded subways or allowing her eyes to hungrily take in the male dancers on the club s ladies night. But as Juicy s sexual cravings grow stronger, one thing becomes frighteningly clear: She s a virtual prisoner in G s dangerous world. As G begins to suspect her of playin him, he pulls the reins he keeps on her even tighter. If she s ever to escape and get a life of her own she must find a way to start stashing away some of G s cash. But doing that under G s watchful eye is a challenge she might not live up to especially when her appetite tempts her with the deadliest desire of all: G s very own son. . . . From the Trade Paperback edition.
