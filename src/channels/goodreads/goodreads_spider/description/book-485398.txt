Told from Hermes' unique perspective are many beloved tales from ancient Greece, including those of Orpheus, Persephone, and Perseus, interwoven with Hermes' own attempts to forge a place for himself among mortal and immortal beings. Herald pulls the reader into ancient Greece and into the mind of a legendary mythological figure as he struggles with power, death, and the carnal treachery of a goddess.
