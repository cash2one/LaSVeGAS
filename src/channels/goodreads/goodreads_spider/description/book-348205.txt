348205:::::The Call:::::The Call continues the message introduced in The Final Quest which challenged Christians around the world to begin living the truth with which they have been entrusted. The Call is a call to life; a call to live in the unprecedented glory of the Son of God; a call to sacrifice to do all things for the sake of the gospel. The darkness will soon be over, and the day of our Lord will soon dawn. Now is the time for us to take a stand against the great darkness of our times for the sake of the Light Who is greater and is surely coming... The "last days" are here.

This book is a call to seize an unprecedented opportunity and to live in a manner worthy of... The Call .
