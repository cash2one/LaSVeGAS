16101507:::::The Advocate Prince:::::Prince Cinos is feared and reviled as the most treacherous mind in the land of Orillia. He bends the law to his will and twists people into webs of his control, but when the tide of magic swells, one girl will gain the power to end his reign forever. Gloria, raised in isolation, barely escapes a fire that destroys her home and is thrust into a world where villains and heroes share the same face, and monsters wear the skins of the pure-hearted. Suspected to be a witch on the wrong side of a civil war, Gloria is captured and brought before the prince. While attempting to extort information from the girl, he uncovers a dangerous enemy from his past and ignites an ancient conflict. As a battle for the source of magic engulfs the kingdom, Cinos must choose where his true loyalties lie.
