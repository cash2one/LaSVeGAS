6116673:::::The Rouseabout:::::Kate Webster is a loveable larrikin who likes to play hard now and worry about the consequences later. She can't help mucking up the opportunities life gives her. Rocked by the death of her mother, she takes on a dare at one of Australia's wildest rural social events - a Bachelors &amp; Spinsters ball - to 'scalp' gorgeous farm boy Nick McDonnell. It's a dare that changes everything. For just as Kate is ready to start her new life, away from her grieving father and the pressures of the family farm, she discovers she is pregnant. Now, several years later, with toddler Nell by her side, it's time for Kate to come home to face the music - and the father of her child . . . Set on the beautiful island of Tasmania, where Rachael Treasure once kicked up her own heels at B&amp;S balls, The Rouseabout is an unforgettable story about discovering the things that truly matter, and finding love that lasts.
