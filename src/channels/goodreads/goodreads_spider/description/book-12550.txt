12550:::::Stiff Upper Lip, Jeeves:::::Bertie Wooster vows that nothing will induce him to return to Totleigh Towers, lair of former magistrate Sir Watkyn Bassett.

But when his old friend 'Stinker' Pinker asks for Bertie's help, there is nothing for it but to buckle down and go there.

It takes Jeeves, posing as Chief Inspector Witherspoon of the Yard, to sort out the mess and retrieve his employer from the soup.
