6643714:::::Over My Dead Body:::::The International Movement for the Safety &amp; Protection Of Our Kids &amp; Youth (IMSPOOKY) dictates that Seymour cannot live in the mansion at 43 Old Cemetery Road "without the benefit of parents." Ignatius B. Grumply tries to explain to Dick Tater, the head of IMSPOOKY, that he and Seymour are in a lovely living (and publishing!) arrangement with the ghost of Olive C. Spence. Dick Tater is not convinced. But this clever trio can t be broken up as easily as he imagines . . . This companion to Dying to Meet You, the first book in the 43 Old Cemetery Road series, is another spooky tale told in letters, drawings, newspaper articles, and television scripts.
