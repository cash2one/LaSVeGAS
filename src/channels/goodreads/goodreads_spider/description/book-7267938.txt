He knows she's too young for him but he has never felt like this about anybody before. She's sexy and sweet and flirty and free and the most beautiful girl he has ever known. Joanna is swept away by her feelings for Zach as they grow increasingly passionate with each other. It's like God has whispered in her heart Zach is the one for her. Can it be true love when you're only fifteen?
