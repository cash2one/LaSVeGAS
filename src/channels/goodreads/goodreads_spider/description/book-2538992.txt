2538992:::::The Praise of Folly:::::First published in Paris in 1511, The Praise of Folly has enjoyed enormous and highly controversial success from the author s lifetime down to our own day. It has no rival, except perhaps Thomas More s Utopia, as the most intense and lively presentation of the literary, social, and theological aims and methods of Northern Humanism. Clarence H. Miller s highly praised translation of The Praise of Folly, based on the definitive Latin text, echoes Erasmus own lively style while retaining the nuances of the original text. In his introduction, Miller places the work in the context of Erasmus as humanist and theologian. In a new afterword, William H. Gass playfully considers the meaning, or meanings, of folly and offers fresh insights into one of the great books of Western literature. Praise for the earlier edition: An eminently reliable and fully annotated edition based on the Latin text. Library Journal Exciting and brilliant, this is likely to be the definitive translation of The Praise of Folly into English. Richard J. Schoeck
