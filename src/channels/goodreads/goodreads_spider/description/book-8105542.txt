8105542:::::Invincible Summer:::::Noah s happier than I ve seen him in months. So I d be an awful brother to get in the way of that. It s not like I have some relationship with Melinda. It was just a kiss. Am I going to ruin Noah s happiness because of a kiss? Across four sun-kissed, drama-drenched summers at his family s beach house, Chase is falling in love, falling in lust, and trying to keep his life from falling apart. But some girls are addictive.... Not your typical beach read.
