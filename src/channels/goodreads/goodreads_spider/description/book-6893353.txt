6893353:::::Tallow:::::On the edge of a mystical border called the Limen, close to a beautiful canal-laced city, a humble candlemaker rescues a child whom he raises as his apprentice. Years pass and the child s unusual talents are revealed, the gentle art of candlemaking slowly transforming into something far more sinister. Lingering in the shadows, enemies watch and wait - a vengeful aristocrat, an exotic queen and the lethal creatures known only as the Morte Whisperers. They hunger after the child s ancient magic and will do anything to control it - betray, lie, manipulate. Even murder. A story of intrigue, deadly magic and a love so deep it transcends life itself.
