23666591:::::Across the Distance:::::There s a drawer I never open. It holds a picture I never look at. It reminds me of a day I hate to remember, but I ll never forget. I d give anything to be like the other girls on campus. Going to parties, flirting with boys, planning for a future. But that s not me. And hasn t been since the day my parents died. The only thing that got me through was Griffin. Even though I didn t have my family, I always had him. Only, now I m not so sure I do. It s not just the eleven hundred miles separating us now that I m at college. And it s more than his band finally taking off, and all the gigs and girls suddenly demanding his time. It s like everything is different the way we talk, the way we text . . . the way he looks at me and the way his looks make me feel. Griffin has been the only good thing in my life since that horrific day. I can feel our friendship slipping away and I m terrified of what will be left in its place
