18782124:::::Bloodshot, Volume 4: H.A.R.D. Corps:::::Every mission...is someone's last! Out of the ashes of Harbinger Wars, Bloodshot is about to join the weaponized men and women of the Harbinger Active Resistance Division - the black budget, technologically-augmented strike force where the powers are dangerously unstable and every mission is a one-way ticket into the meat grinder. With a reluctant leader calling the shots and a new crop of untested rookies manning the frontline, Bloodshot is about to take H.A.R.D. Corps behind enemy lines, and into a gasoline-drenched, synapses-snapping suicide run where no one is safe...and heroes always die trying! Join acclaimed writers Christos Gage ( Avengers Academy ) and Joshua Dysart ( Harbinger Wars ) and superstar-in-the-making Emanuela Lupacchino (Archer &amp; Armstrong) right here to light the fuse on an explosive new chapter for Bloodshot and the Valiant Universe's most feared team of superhuman operatives!
