3430898:::::The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, Vol. 2:::::"Let's track down aliens, time travelers, and psychics and hang out with them!" Haruhi Suzumiya established the SOS Brigade for that sole purpose. But why has she been acting so strange of late? So... melancholy? Unable to locate any supernatural beings (even though they're right there in the club room the whole time), Haruhi's frustrations turn violent. What's Kyon gotten himself mixed up in this time?! Enjoy volume 2 of this somewhat abnormal high school story!
