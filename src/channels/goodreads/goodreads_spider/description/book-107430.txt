107430:::::The Road from Coorain: A Woman's Exquisitely Clear-Sighted Memoir of Growing Up Australian:::::There is a clarity, elegance, and beauty to Conway's Road to Coorain that places it firmly at the apogee of autobiography along with such masterpieces as West With the Night by Beryl Markham, or An American Childhood , by Annie Dillard. From the first sentence, you will be drawn inexorably into the story of her childhood in New South Wales, Australia, and her gradual discovery of and by the larger world: the clarity of Conway's language satisfies like cold clear water after a day in the desert: the rhythm of her sentences has a timelessness and expansiveness akin to the Australian landscape itself. This is very likely a book you will remember the rest of your life. Highly Recommended.
