17977479:::::From Johann To Tannenbaum:::::Johann Andreas IV is a rich loser who has a raw deal in life. He is handsome, yet with a poor self-image, clever, but still uneducated, and despite being the heir apparent in his grandfather's will, he's about to be thrown out with nothing. In the underground colony of his birth, two things matter the most to its denizens: a name, which will guarantee his wealth and status, and a designated branding tattoo, the only thing allowing Colony-Dwellers to live safely underground. Johann has one year to secure both. He's up to the challenge but one thing stands in his way; his mother has plans of her own...and they don't include him.
