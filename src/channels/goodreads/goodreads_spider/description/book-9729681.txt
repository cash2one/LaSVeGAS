9729681:::::Devoted:::::When love is lost but never forgotten... Clea Raymond found her soulmate in mysterious and handsome Sage, and discovered that they have loved each other through many past lives, all of which ended tragically. Clea wants nothing more than to prevent history from repeating itself and to be with her true love. But there are dark forces in the world: people who want to destroy Sage and the Elixir that makes him immortal. Sage has been taken, yet Clea is certain he is still alive and will stop at nothing to find him. She turns to her friend Ben, and they enter into an uneasy alliance with Cursed Vengeance, an ancient faction that has information that can lead them to Sage. Clea must get to Sage before Cursed Vengeance does, or risk his death at their hands. But Ben's role in Sage's kidnapping - and in their past lives - leaves Clea questioning whether Ben can be counted on. Just when they get closest to their goal, the events around her make Clea wonder if she's really saving Sage... or if she's leading them to repeat their disastrous pasts all over again. Devoted is the thrilling continuation of the heart-pounding series that began with the New York Times bestseller Elixir .
