1806174:::::Horse Show:::::TO THE SADDLE Club, there's nothing more exciting than riding horses at Pine Hollow - until they're invited to New York City to watch the American Horse Show! Max's former student, Dorothy DeSoto, will be competing, and the girls will get a backstage view of competitive riding. And in their free time, Lisa, Carole, and Stevie might just get to be the star of their own show - on the big screen!
