6557156:::::Unholy Magic:::::ENEMIES DON T NEED TO BE ALIVE TO BE DEADLY. For Chess Putnam, finding herself near-fatally poisoned by a con psychic and then stopping a murderous ghost is just another day on the job. As an agent of the Church of Real Truth, Chess must expose those looking to profit from the world s unpleasant little poltergeist problem humans filing false claims of hauntings all while staving off any undead who really are looking for a kill. But Chess has been extra busy these days, coping with a new celebrity assignment while trying on her own time to help some desperate prostitutes. Someone s taking out the hookers of Downside in the most gruesome way, and Chess is sure the rumors that it s the work of a ghost are way off base. But proving herself right means walking in the path of a maniac, not to mention standing between the two men in her life just as they along with their ruthless employers are moving closer to a catastrophic showdown. Someone is dealing in murder, sex, and the supernatural, and once again Chess finds herself right in the crossfire.
