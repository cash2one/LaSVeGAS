271457:::::A Mayan Astronomer in Hell's Kitchen: Poems:::::In his sixth collection, American Book Award winner Mart n Espada has created a poetic mural. There are conquerors, slaves, and rebels from Caribbean history; the "Mayan astronomer" calmly smoking a cigarette in the middle of a New York tenement fire; a nun staging a White House vigil to protest her torture; a man on death row mourning the loss of his books; and even Carmen Miranda.
