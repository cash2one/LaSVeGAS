11262178:::::Red Hot:::::The quiet life of Julie Simms, children's librarian, suddenly reads like a spy novel when she discovers her parents were art thieves. The thrilling bedtime stories her mother told her when she was little weren't imaginary: they were real. And they got both her parents killed. But Julie didn't know that when she compiled the tales into a newly published book for children. Now as government agents, art thieves and a sexy-but-too-curious new neighbor pop up at every turn, Julie is swept up into her parents' lethal legacy. At the heart of the mystery is a missing painting: Portrait of Isabella. Putting together clues from the past, Julie suspects her only shot at untangling the mess is to find the painting herself before dying young becomes another family tradition.
