19475852:::::Kicking Off: Why hooliganism and racism are killing football:::::Bestselling author and world-renowned hooliganism expert Dougie Brimson picks up where his previous book BARMY ARMY left off, in the spring of 2000 and the horrific murders of Kevin Speight and Chris Loftus at the hands of Turkish hooligans and the riots involving England fans in Turkey. If the media and police are to be believed, the battle to defeat the hooligans has been all but won. But in KICKING OFF Brimson points out that the reality is somewhat different and paints a disturbing picture of what lies ahead for the game if the culture of hate, racism and violence remains unchecked.
