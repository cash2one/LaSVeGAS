10692829:::::The Ninth Day:::::One of the top thriller writers working today. With crisp writing, clever plotting, and memorable characters, this one will satisfy even the most finicky of readers. Steve Berry, New York Times bestselling author of The Jefferson Key Tess Gerritsen praised former Chicago lawyer-turned-writer Jamie Freveletti s stunning debut thriller, Running from the Devil as a breathless, hair-raising read, and author Lee Child called it, just terrific. Now, with The Ninth Day , Freveletti brings back her courageous and brilliant series protagonist Emma Caldridge for a third time ensnaring the intrepid biochemist and marathon runner in the vicious web of a Mexican drug cartel determined to carry a terrible, virulent death across the border into the United States. A rapidly rising star in contemporary thriller fiction, Jaimie Freveletti fills her remarkable suspense novels with the explosive, non-stop action of a Daniel Silva adventure and the fascinating scientific detail of a Kathy Reichs or Patricia Cornwell blockbuster. And The Ninth Day is Freveletti s best so far.
