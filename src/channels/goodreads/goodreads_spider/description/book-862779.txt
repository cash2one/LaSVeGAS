862779:::::My Lover's Lover:::::When Lily meets Marcus, she feels an immediate attraction to him. Within a week, she has moved into the magnetic architect s echoing loft in East London. But nothing could have prepared Lily for what she finds there. The distinct presence of another woman lingers in the loft, one who seems to have disappeared in a hurry, leaving behind a single party dress, a puzzling mark on the wall, and the suffocating scent of jasmine. Lily s unsettling curiosity soon turns to obsession as the spirit of this mysterious woman increasingly haunts her. With a nod to Daphne du Maurier s classic novel Rebecca , My Lover s Lover is a sexy, modern gothic tale that will keep readers hooked until the very end.
