6501392:::::Fairy School Dropout Undercover:::::Hide your wings . . . we re going undercover! Elly Knottleweed-Eversprightly has a secret. A big secret. She is a fairy, and she even has the wings to prove it. Every time Elly goes to a new fairy school, it ends in disaster, but this week, Elly is going undercover at her friend Jess s South Street School. Human school should be a piece of cake. No spells. No flying. Just normal human stuff. But Elly s fairy blunders make her feel like she s been living under a toadstool. Plus, there s something fishy going on. All the girls are into fairies, and Elly smells magic. Is she really the only fairy at South Street School?
