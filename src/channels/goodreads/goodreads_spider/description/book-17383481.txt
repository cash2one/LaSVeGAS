17383481:::::Tail of the Devil:::::Like many homeless kids, fifteen-year-old Mathias Drvar died on the streets. Unlike the rest, he came back as a vampire. If Mathias thought being homeless sucked, being a vampire is worse. The vampires who transformed him believe he is the reincarnation of an ancient king. They expect him to quit swearing, use a napkin, and play by their weird, ancient rules. F that. But after the reigning queen assaults Mathias, he has visions of a past life in which he was that king. Turns out the current queen killed him then, and wants to kill him again. He d better grow up fast, because if he doesn t his second life may be shorter than his first.
