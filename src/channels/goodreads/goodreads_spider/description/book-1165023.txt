1165023:::::Daughter of Ireland:::::I am the wind which breathes on the water. I am the swell of the sea. I am the light of the sun. I am the point of the battle spear. I am the God who gives fires to the mind. Who announces the ages of the moon? Who speaks to the setting of the sun? I, only I. Aislinn ni Sorar, druid priestess of ancient Ireland, is a visionary. Raised according to the ancient ways and seeking to use her gifts to keep the old magic strong, she has the power to part the mists of time and see events that might shape a nation. But Aislinn s own past is shrouded in mystery, and her quest to discover that past will bring her pain, as well as true love, and will set in motion a chain of events that will alter both her own future and that of her beloved Ireland. For there is a new spirit upon the land whose presence heralds a rendering--and a remaking--of this world. His way had been foretold long ago and threatens to change everything. And Aislinn is at the heart of that change. Will she give up everything that she loves to help her people find the true God, or will she turn to the dark forces that threaten to keep the old ways at any cost? Daughter of Ireland continues Juilene Osborne-McKnight's exploration of Irish history, combining fine historical research with skillful storytelling. Her focus this time is none other than Cormac mac Art, ancient and venerated King of Ireland, and the path the Irish people follow to find the one true God. Osborne-McKnight has crafted an engaging young heroine who chronicles both Celtic mythology and early pagan/Christian theology through her travels, and re-creates a world whose conflicts over power, religion, and law are as immediate and far-reaching as those same conflicts in our own time.
