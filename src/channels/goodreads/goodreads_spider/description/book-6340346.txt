6340346:::::House of Reckoning:::::After the untimely death of her mother, fourteen-year-old Sarah Crane is forced to grow up quickly in order to help tend her family s Vermont farm and look after her grieving father, who s drowning his sorrow in alcohol. But their quiet life together is shattered when her father is jailed for killing another man in a barroom brawl and injuring Sarah in a drunken car crash. Left in the cold care of a loveless foster family and alienated at school, Sarah finds a kindred spirit in classmate Nick Dunnigan, a former mental patient still plagued by voices and visions. And in eccentric art instructor Bettina Phillips, Sarah finds a mentor eager to nurture her talent for painting. But within the walls of Bettina s ancestral home, the mansion called Shutters, Sarah finds something altogether different and disturbing. Monstrous images from the house s dark history seem to flow unbidden from Sarah s paintbrush images echoed by Nick s chilling hallucinations. Trapped for ages in the shadowy rooms of Shutters, the violence and fury of long-dead generations have finally found a gateway from the grave into the world of the living. And Sarah and Nick have found a power they never had: to take control, and take revenge.
