263466:::::Dragon's Egg:::::"In science fiction there is only a handful of books that stretch the mind--and this is one of them."--Arthur C. Clarke In a moving story of sacrifice and triumph, human scientists establish a relationship with intelligent lifeforms--the cheela--living on Dragon's Egg, a neutron star where one Earth hour is equivalent to hundreds of their years. The cheela culturally evolve from savagery to the discovery of science, and for a brief time, men are their diligent teachers. Praise for Dragon's Egg "Bob Forward writes in the tradition of Hal Clement's Mission of Gravity and carries it a giant step (how else?) forward." --Isaac Asimov " Dragon's Egg is superb. I couldn't have written it; it required too much real physics." --Larry Niven "This is one for the real science-fiction fan." --Frank Herbert "Robert L. Forward tells a good story and asks a profound question. If we run into a race of creatures who live a hundred years while we live an hour, what can they say to us or we to them?" --Freeman J. Dyson "Forward has impeccable scientific credentials, and . . . big, original, speculative ideas." -- The Washington Post
