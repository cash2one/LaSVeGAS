511259:::::Aunt Dimity Beats the Devil:::::"Aunt Dimity Beats the Devil" takes place ten months after Aunt Dimity's Christmas. The twins are walking and talking and Lori is going stir crazy. When her old boss, Stan Finderman, asks her to travel to Tarrant Hall in Northumberland to evaluate a book collection, she jumps at the chance.Lori arrives to find a creepy Victorian mansion with turrets and towers. But her hosts, newlyweds Nicola and Paul Hollander, warmly welcome Lori into their home. Lori works through the inches of dust and spider webs to examine the library's books -- and there she discovers a trove of love letters dating from WWI, written by a young lieutenant to his lover Claire, Nicola's great aunt. One of the letters hints at a hidden treasure somewhere within Tarrant Hall. Lori is surprised when this news seems to disturb rather than intrigue Nicola, and as All Souls' Eve approaches, Nicola confesses to hearing bumps in the night. She wants to know: does Lori believe in ghosts? Aunt Dimity guides Lori toward uncovering the mysteries of Tarrant Hall -- which involve old family secrets and otherworldy spirits -- and it all turns out to be much more interesting than evaluating a rare book collection.
