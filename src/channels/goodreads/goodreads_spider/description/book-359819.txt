359819:::::The Defenders of the Dead:::::The Defenders of the Dead live in the past while they destroy the future. They face a revolt of the Young--a band of rebels led by two teenagers, Cerasi and Nield. Thirteen-year-old Obi-Wan Kenobi and his Jedi Master Qui-Gon Jinn are not supposed to take sides in any war. But once Obi-Wan meets Cerasi and Nield, he feels he must join their fight...even though Qui-Gon forbids it. The rebellion has become personal. And Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon are on opposing sides.
