1749162:::::The Great Cheese Conspiracy:::::Merciless Marvin the Magnificent is not your average theater mouse. He's a crime boss.

But Marvin longs for the Big Time. He wants an adventure on the Outside, a place no mouse has ever returned from alive. Marvin hitches a ride out of the theater and discovers a cheese shop nearby. It's the perfect target for his gang's biggest heist yet. But can Marvin, Fats, and Raymond agree on the right plan? And what happens when the mice come face-to-face with the Enemy and his furry feline friend?
