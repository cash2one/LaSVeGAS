22663352:::::Blackbird Fly:::::Future rock star, or friendless misfit? That s no choice at all. In this debut tween novel, twelve-year-old Apple grapples with being different; with friends and backstabbers and following her dreams. Apple has always felt a little different from her classmates. She and her mother moved to Louisiana from the Philippines when she was little, and her mother still cooks Filipino foods, makes mistakes with her English, and chastises Apple for becoming too American. It becomes unbearable in middle school, when the boys the stupid, stupid boys in Apple s class put her name on the Dog Log, the list of the most unpopular girls in school. When Apple s friends turn on her and everything about her life starts to seem weird and embarrassing, Apple turns to music. If she can just save enough to buy a guitar and learn to play, maybe she can change herself. It might be the music that saves her . . . or it might be her two new friends, who show how special she really is.
