444560:::::The Letters of Charlotte Bronte: With a Selection of Letters by Family and Friends, Volume I: 1829-1847:::::Despite Charlotte Bronte's entreaty to her lifelong friend Ellen Nussey to burn her correspondence, very little seems to have been destroyed, and in this fully annotated edition, based as far as possible on original manuscripts, many confidential and outspoken letters are published in full for the first time. As well as Charlotte's own letters from 1829 to 1847, a handful of important letters and diary extracts by her friends and family illuminate the writer's correspondence. This volume covers the period from her childhood up to the publication and review of Jane Eyre. "
