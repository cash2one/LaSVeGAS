22030418:::::Karma Destiny or Choice:::::Karma - Destiny or Choice is a small effort to simplify and to explain one of the most important Law of Nature "Karma". I know most of us feel it boring but it might be due to lengthy or heavy content of books. This book is not a Literature Masterpiece but I have tried to convey message in the simplest language. It is not related to any religion but still related to every religion. It talks about the connection of Karma with GOD, Human Being, Relations, Anger, Helping, Soul etc. Karma plays a very crucial role at every stage of Life and Death. Sometimes we feel very helpless and sometimes we have options. If we see the fixed pattern of life then we may think that Karma is Destiny but when Life changes by our Choices then it makes us believe Karma as a choice. This book addresses and discusses the same. We will come across to a simple law of nature which is made or presented as complicated. When you read you will be able to relate as we all must have faced something similar in this Lifetime. Happy Reading and Please share your Views and Feedback...:-)
