18105262:::::What Wendy Wants:::::After thirteen years of marriage and three children, Wendy Hayward is bored with sex. As much as she loves her husband, Frank, Wendy married "Mr. Vanilla." Now she reads nothing but erotic romance on her Kindle and fantasizes about having sex with fictional characters, complete strangers, and tattooed rock stars. Sometimes even the T.V. weatherman looks good. One fateful day however, her husband grabs the wrong Kindle on the way to work, and discovers some of Wendy's more "interesting' fantasies. Unbeknownst to Wendy, Frank is very keen to fulfil every one of her secret desires.
