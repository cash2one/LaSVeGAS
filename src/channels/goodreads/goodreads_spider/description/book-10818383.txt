10818383:::::Masques and Wolfsbane:::::Before Patricia Briggs penned her bestselling Mercy Thompson series, she cut her authorial teeth on a medieval fantasy called Masques . In it we meet Aralorn, a shapeshifter who fled her noble existence for a life of adventure as a mercenary spy. A jewel in the rough, Masques promised a sequel that never saw the light of day...until now. Together with the newly revised and updated first novel, Wolfsbane weaves a sinuous story of romance, danger, mystery, and magic. Masques &amp; Wolfsbane delivers the first two tales of the Sianim saga in one fast and fiercely fun volume. In Masques , Aralorn and her companion Wolf a shapeshifter whose feral form hides a mysterious past are sent to fight Geoffrey ae Magi, a sorcerer with dangerous plans for Aralorn s homeland...and all mankind. But can they defeat his illusory magic a power so great it transforms men and monsters into vacuous slaves? In Wolfsbane , Aralorn and Wolf must come to terms with their feelings for each other as they return home for her father s funeral. Yet when they arrive, they learn that the Lyon of Lambshold is not dead, but trapped in a powerful spell. Can they find who s behind it...before Aralorn falls to the blackest of magics?
