13643131:::::Friday Brown:::::I am Friday Brown. I buried my mother. My grandfather buried a swimming pool. A boy who can t speak has adopted me. A girl kissed me. I broke and entered. Now I m fantasizing about a guy who s a victim of crime and I am the criminal. I m going nowhere and every minute I m not moving, I m being tail-gated by a curse that may or may not be real. They call me Friday. It has been foretold that on a Saturday I will drown Friday, 17, flees memories of her mother, granddad, and the family curse. She joins Silence in a street gang led by beautiful charismatic Arden, and escapes to a ghost town in the outback. In Murungal Creek, the town of never leaving, Friday faces the ghosts of her past. Sometimes you have to stay to finish what you started, and before you can find out who you are, you have to become someone you never meant to be.
