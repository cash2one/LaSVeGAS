669125:::::Hollywood Hulk Hogan:::::Yeah, I'm the towering red-and-yellow warrior who revolutionized the wrestling business, the larger-than-life superhero who transformed an entire country into a horde of Hulkamaniacs . I'm the guy who spit blood and breathed fire to help create an empire called World Wrestling Entertainment . But it wasn't always like that. Once I was a fat kid named Terry Bollea watching legends like Dusty Rhodes and Superstar Billy Graham, never dreaming I'd be a professional wrestler myself one day. Find out what makes me cry like a baby and what makes my blood boil. Then tell me you know the man called Hollywood Hulk Hogan .
