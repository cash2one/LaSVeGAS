17447901:::::Swinging through life Cassie's Story:::::Cassie is a go with the flow type of woman. Her life has not always been easy but she still loves finding creative ways in managing it. Being a full time mom and wife while maintaining a job, she does not get much downtime. However, she makes spending time with her three childhood friends a priority. These four women meet once a week for brunch and start a book club, while spending time together. Having extremely different backgrounds, the friends are very controversial and have to keep opened minds when deciding the type of novels to read. After all the women decide to read an erotic romance series, it changes their lives in unexpected ways. In Cassie s story, she learns how to bring romance back into her marriage and in return, it makes her relationship stronger with her husband. She gains confidence in embracing the sexual being within herself that she had lost before she had her children. She never realized that taking care of all aspects in her life was not only for her benefit, but their family as well. This book is a total work of fiction with a strong sexual nature. It has comedy, drama, and heart felt situations in which I think many people could relate to. This is not a book for children or anyone under 18 years of age.
