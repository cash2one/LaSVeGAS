16147044:::::His Wicked Pleasure:::::All rational thoughts left Declan Kavanagh's mind, the second he spotted the beautiful ,club owner, Kristie Gallo. He's a trained Navy Seal, who specializes in special ops, and security and was hired at her club. Just being near her set his mind spinning, and his heart beating overtime. He had to have her, and was prepared to do anything and everything just to make her his. Twenty-one year old, Kristie Gallo has the world at her feet, she has a successful business, great family, and great friends. Most of her time is spent at her nightclub, Club Paradise, that is, until the day Declan Kavanagh walked into her club as a security expert. The nearness of him sets her blood boiling, and heats her in places anyone has yet to to explore. Will she give in to what she is feeling for him, or will she continue fighting the feeling?
