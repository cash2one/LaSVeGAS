273843:::::Thirteen Albatrosses::::::Harington returns to Stay More to document the uproarious attempt of native son Vernon Ingledew to earn the governorship of his great, if sometimes much-maligned, state.

Thirteen Albatrosses knowingly chronicles the dizzying display of nonsense and idealism that is contemporary politics.
