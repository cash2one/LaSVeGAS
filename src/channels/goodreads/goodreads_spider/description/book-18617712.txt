18617712:::::Not Open: Win the Invisible Spiritual Culture War:::::In our effort to be open, tolerant, relevant, nonjudgmental, and accepted, there are now very few differences between those that call themselves Christians and those that don t. Only 1% of the Millennial generation have a biblical world view. Only 9% of adults do. Why? Culture has demanded we accept its views on morality, family, love, and spirituality and its interpretation of God s Word. The subtle erosion of compromised truth has overtaken and diluted our lives to be weak and powerless like the culture that surrounds us. Why would the world want what they already have? The battle is upon us, and Not Open is a critical beacon of light, exposing the deceptions of compromise. Not Open will help you detect the areas of OPEN that the culture has so cleverly woven into your life and challenge you to live the powerful, life altering, and undiluted life that has been planned for you and your family through living and reflecting the truth of Jesus Christ and God s Word.
