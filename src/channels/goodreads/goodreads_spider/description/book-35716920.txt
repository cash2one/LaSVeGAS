35716920:::::Dragon Lyric: A Short Story:::::Her husband is a dragon. And the dragon is hungry. Drawn by his allure, Theryn left everything behind to live with Roth in his mountain cave. But then her fiery-eyed husband transformed into something else: a monster of scales, claws, and wings. The dragon has only one use for her to bear his dragon egg, now forming in her womb. After the egg is laid, she will be nothing but fresh meat. But Theryn refuses to suffer the same fate as Roth s former brides. For her own sake, and for the baby dragonshifter she carries, she must find a way to escape the monster, and break the enchantment of the dragon lyric.
