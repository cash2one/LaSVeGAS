21453662:::::Tintin: The Complete Companion:::::A fully illustrated guide to the world-famous comic character Tintin, and his adventures. This well-researched and gorgeously presented overview follows Tintin through the 23 titles of the complete series. Tintin is the classic example of groundbreaking graphic narrative that all others can be compared to. Written and drawn between 1929 and 1976, the 23 adventures of Tintin, his dog Snowy and an unforgettable cast of characters has become a defining standard of graphic literature. The Complete Companion contextualizes the work of Tintin's creator, Herge, and places it in its historical context. Author Michael Farr shows Herge's drawings side by side with their references, demonstrating how he established believable backgrounds and realistic details. The Companion includes a large number of sketches, which Herge would re-work and polish until he found the clearest, most easily readable line-giving birth to a style that would later be called Clear Line.The Adventures of Tintin mix universal appeal, adventure and slapstick, drama and humor in a collection of stories that have stood the test of time and whose art style has been adopted by new generations of European cartoonists. This is the ultimate companion to the Adventures of Tintin. Book Details: Format: Hardcover Publication Date: 9/15/2011 Pages: 208
