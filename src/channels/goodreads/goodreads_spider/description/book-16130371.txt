16130371:::::Carniepunk:::::A star-studded urban fantasy anthology featuring bestselling authors Rachel Caine, Rob Thurman, Seanan McGuire, Jennifer Estep, and Kevin Hearne, whose stories explore the creepy, mysterious, and, yes, sometimes magical world of traveling carnivals. The traveling carnival is a leftover of a bygone era, a curiosity lurking on the outskirts of town. It is a place of contradictions the bright lights mask the peeling paint; a carnie in greasy overalls slinks away from the direction of the Barker s seductive call. It is a place of illusion is that woman s beard real? How can she live locked in that watery box? And while many are tricked by sleight of hand, there are hints of something truly magical going on. One must remain alert and learn quickly the unwritten rules of this dark show. To beat the carnival, one had better have either a whole lot of luck or a whole lot of guns or maybe some magic of one s own. Featuring stories grotesque and comical, outrageous and action-packed, Carniepunk is the first anthology to channel the energy and attitude of urban fantasy into the bizarre world of creaking machinery, twisted myths, and vivid new magic. RACHEL CAINE s vampires aren t child s play, as a na ve teen discovers when her heart leads her far, far astray in The Cold Girl. With Parlor Tricks, JENNIFER ESTEP pits Gin Blanco, the Elemental Assassin, against the Wheel of Death and some dangerously creepy clowns. SEANAN McGUIRE narrates a poignant, ethereal tale of a mysterious carnival that returns to a dangerous town after twenty years in Daughter of the Midway, the Mermaid, and the Open, Lonely Sea. KEVIN HEARNE s Iron Druid and his wisecracking Irish wolfhound discover in The Demon Barker of Wheat Street that the impossibly wholesome sounding Kansas Wheat Festival is actually not a healthy place to hang out. With an eerie, unpredictable twist, ROB THURMAN reveals the fate of a psychopath stalking two young carnies in Painted Love.
