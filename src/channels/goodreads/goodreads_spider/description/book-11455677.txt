11455677:::::Journey:::::I turned my attention to Braw. Tomorrow night, we will have a small demonstration of your power. You will help me liberate five beings from their demons. If all goes well, we will wait four nights until the moons align with the star of Juns and when the magic of this world is at its peak, we will channel the power of Laif through the entire world, whereupon we will rid the world of demons. My jaw dropped. You ll kill them all! Braw shook his head. No dear. We will free them. You don t get it! I could feel panic taking a hold of me. The Namaels, the Majs, they re not possessed! That s just who they are! It s genetic! I looked up at Brice and was shocked by the blank look on his face. Brice! You have to explain to him. It will kill you! Brice turned slowly to look at me, his eyes wide. Hayden has made up her mind. If she doesn t pick sides between the Namaels and the Majs then innocent beings won t die because of her. Of course, things can never be that simple and when she is taken prisoner by the humans a whole new problem arises. It doesn t take long before everything she thought she knew no longer makes sense. Could it be possible that the prophecy was wrong?
