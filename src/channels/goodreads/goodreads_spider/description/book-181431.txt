As Jimena runs for her life, she is caught by the police and put in jail. There she is further threatened by a new type of Follower with a shape-changing power she is unable to resist. Her only choice is to break out of jail and hide out with a most unlikely ally-her old gang rival, Payasa. Together they have to save the other Daughters of the Moon before Jimena's most terrifying premonition comes true.
