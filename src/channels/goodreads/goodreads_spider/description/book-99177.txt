99177:::::Outrageous Acts and Everyday Rebellions:::::Outrageous Acts and Everyday Rebellions --a phenomenal success that sold nearly half a million copies since its original publication in 1983--is Gloria Steinem's most diverse and timeless collection of essays. Both male and female readers have acclaimed it as a witty, warm, and life-changing view of the world--"as if women mattered." Steinem's truly personal writing is here, from the humorous expose "I Was a Playboy Bunny" to the moving tribute to her mother "Ruth's Song (Because She Could Not Sing It)" to prescient essays on female genital mutilation and the difference between erotica and pornography. The satirical and hilarious "If Men Could Menstruate" alone is worth the price of admission. This second edition features a new preface by the author and added notes on classic essays.
