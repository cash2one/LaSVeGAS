16468:::::The Phantom Tollbooth:::::For Milo, everything's a bore. When a mysterious tollbooth appears in his room, he drives through only because he's got nothing better to do.

Milo visits the island of Conclusions (you get there by jumping), learns about time from a ticking watchdog named Tock, and goes up against the dastardly Discord and Dynne. By the time Milo and Tock set off toward the Mountains of Ignorance to rescue the twin Princesses Rhyme and Reason, Milo realizes something astonishing. Life is far from dull. In fact, it's exciting beyond his wildest dreams...
