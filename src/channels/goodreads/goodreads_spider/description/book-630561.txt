630561:::::Hunted:::::Explosions, car wrecks, assassins, escaped murderers, and a kidnapping.arranged marriages can really take their toll on a vampire. First installment in The Guardians' League series (stand-alone novels with shared characters that may be read in any order but work best in the correct order). Witness to a brutal murder, Sian Lazuro didn't count on the killer escaping moments after his conviction. Three years later, she's learned the hard way there's only one person she can trust-herself. When she wakes up in bed with a gorgeous stranger who claims to have saved her life, she's understandably wary. Diego Leonides is like no one she's ever met before. Sensual, mysterious, and clearly delusional, he insists not only is he a vampire, but she's now his eternal mate. Diego never dreamed he'd find his mate by getting hit by her car, and he's no happier about their sudden bonding than she is. The only survivor of a massacre that wiped out his entire Clan, he's spent the last century avoiding taking a mate. Now he finds himself stuck with a woman running from a murderer just as the descendants of the vampire slayers who killed his family arrive in San Francisco to finish the job with him. Arranged marriages are hard enough on a vampire without having to convince his mate that the real bloodthirsty fiends are the mortals. Warning, this title contains the following: explicit sex, violence.
