203499:::::Cutting: Understanding and Overcoming Self-Mutilation:::::"Cutting" takes the reader through the psychological experience of the person who seeks relief from mental anguish in self-inflicted physical pain. Steven Levenkron traces the components that predispose a personality to self-mutilation: genetics, family experience, childhood trauma, and parental behavior. Written for self-mutilators, parents, friends, and therapists, this book explains why the disorder manifests in self-harming behaviors and, most of all, describes how self-mutilators can be helped.
