708432:::::Over and Over:::::An enchanting picture book by beloved author Charlotte Zolotow, celebrating the coming holidays, changing seasons, and rhythm of time. A little girl remembers a snowman, a pumpkin, and birthday cake. But she doesn t understand time. Summer, winter, autumn, and spring are all mixed up in her mind. What comes next? Garth William s classic illustrations beautifully complement this sweet tale as a little girl begins to understand the circular passing of seasons and her excitement when it begins all over again.
