They gather in secret, conspiring, dreaming of nothing less than humanity's destruction, and their numbers are growing. Earl Preston knows the danger all too well.

But Earl is not the only one with a mystery on their hands.

They thought the nightmare was over, but they are about to discover that the horror has only just begun.
