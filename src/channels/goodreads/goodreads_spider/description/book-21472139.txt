21472139:::::Through a Mother's Eyes:::::Imagine taking your child out of school early, the child saying goodbye to his friends and teacher. Imagine checking into a hotel after you have purchased Benadryl, Lopressor, and razor blades. Imagine stopping at McDonald s to buy your son s favorite meal. Imagine driving back to the hotel and reading with your son from his favorite dinosaur books. Imagine he gets to stay up late to watch Nickelodeon. Imagine you tell your trusting son to take six Benadryl tablets, several Lopressor tablets. Imagine. Imagine watching every facial expression as you hold your son in your arms, kiss his forehead, and say goodbye. Imagine he begins to convulse from the medications he swallowed. Imagine taking a razor blade and cutting his wrists the wrong way. Imagine, since you cut him wrong, you try to cut through his neck. Imagine you believe he has finally died, but you don t want him to be found covered in his blood, so you take him to the bath and set him down into the warm water to wash the blood off of him. Imagine you learn later that your son drowned. What if, what you imagined was true? Through a Mother s Eyes is that true crime story.
