96160:::::Keep Going: The Art of Perseverance:::::Grandfather says this: In life there is sadness as well as joy, losing as well as winning, falling as well as standing, hunger as well as plenty, bad as well as good. I do not say this to make you despair, but to teach you that life is a journey sometimes walked in light and sometimes in shadow. Grandfather says this: Keep going. These thought-provoking lessons, passed down by the author s own Lakota grandfather, will inspire the hundreds of thousands who already know his work and will tap into the market that has embraced such books as Oriah Mountain Dreamer s The Invitation. When a young man s father dies, he turns to his sagacious grandfather for comfort. Together they sit underneath the family s cottonwood tree, and the grandfather shares his perspective on life, the perseverance it requires, and the pleasure and pain of the journey. Filled with dialogue, stories, and recollections, each section focuses on a portion of the prose poem Keep Going and provides commentary on the text. Readers will draw comfort, knowledge, and strength from the Grandfather s wise words just as Marshall himself did.
