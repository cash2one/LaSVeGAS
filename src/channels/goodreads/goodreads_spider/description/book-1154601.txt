1154601:::::One Tattered Angel: A Touching True Story of the Power of Love:::::"Blaine, I think this little girl is our baby." Little did Kathy Yorgason realize what those words would come to mean. Charity Afton Yorgason was born without a brain. She had a brain stem, but her foster parents were told she would most likely die before she was two years old. Blaine and Kathy's response was simple: "If she needs a home, we'll be happy to give it to her" So Charity was adopted and the miracles began. This little girl quickly refuted all the medical evidence and proved she was capable of a great many things. She could smile and laugh, she could hear, she could follow people with her eyes and recognize loved ones. Regrettably, she could also obviously feel pain, and her suffering at times was almost incomprehensible. But the greatest of Charity's attributes was the love that radiated from her smile and her eyes to touch the hearts of all who knew her. She literally and permanently changed lives for the better just by being alive. This astounding true account includes all the years of Charity's life and is a stunning testimony of the power of the spirit, the love of God, and the purpose of mortality.
