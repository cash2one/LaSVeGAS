The Conversation of Merachefet: A Book of Secrets is best interpreted as an intrinsic esoteric conversation in which the essence of all purpose and of all universal form are discussed. A free-flowing dialogue designed as a single lengthy conversation, this writing is described by the author to be her most revealing work ever. The pages within will take you on an inward odyssey of seraphic discoveries, which can be likened only unto pure magic, raw wisdom, and deific insight. The word Merachefet itself is given to mystical terminology. It has been discussed, highly valued by, the wisest of ancient rabbis and sages. The name C. JoyBell C. has become synonymous with the virtues of wisdom and beauty, while her globally scattered words are readily gathered by people from all walks of life; from the most respected of doctors, professors, astronomers, movers and shakers of the world today; to the most current celebrities and the humblest of individuals in society! Such an equanimity and symphony are produced by her words, however, have you ever stopped to ask yourself what the root of all this is, where it all comes from? Within the covers of this book, you will find those roots uncovered, exposing a pure and eternal form of knowledge that will render you to an utterly Elysian experience.
