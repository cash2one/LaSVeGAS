13002124:::::Secret of Bog Lane:::::In a historic American town, on a dead-end road named Bog Lane, a spacious home goes up for sale. Located near Cape Cod Bay, the house comes with six acres of lush woodlands. Its owner, a wealthy geologist, instructs a real-estate agent to sell the place at a substantially reduced price as quickly as possible. The geologist then sets off for Brazil on urgent business. The extraordinary deal lures a hard-working couple and their son to Bog Lane. When they explore the house they find an enormously enlarged basement that contains a vast, tropical garden. This underground jungle is the first in a series of strange turns that increasingly mystify and imperil the home s new occupants. Thousands of miles away, deep in the Amazon rain forest, an American explorer renews his relationship with an isolated tribe of people known as Inucans. They give him a hero s welcome, and their veneration only grows when he promises to rid the Inucans of all disease and make them the envy of all nations. But the Inucan chief, and a Bolivian nurse who lives with the tribe, wonder how the visitor intends to achieve these goals. They gradually come to realize that the American is the harbinger of something far less benign than wishful promises. The Secret of Bog Lane unfolds in present-day Brazil and Massachusetts. The people in both locations are in grave danger as they face an evil that is as ancient as the Tower of Babel and as modern as the most advanced scientific technology.
