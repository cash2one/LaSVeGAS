30967137:::::London for immigrant suckers:::::Peter Kovach's life from his youth in Yugoslavia to his immigrant status in London is the subject of this novel. It is not your typical life, not your typical autobiographical genre either. Peter's journey is recounted with humour, often black and underneath this lies another level covering the political, philosophical, cultural and emotional thoughts of an immigrant to London. This is an account of one man's journey from childhood to middle age but with an additional, major, element... It is also the account of the latter stages of the life of a nation: Yugoslavia! The story of the decline and breakup of Yugoslavia are told through the tale of one man: for Peter Kovach it was never personal, it was always political!
