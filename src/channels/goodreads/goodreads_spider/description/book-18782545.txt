18782545:::::Beautiful Names of Allah:::::The pristine beliefs of the early Muslims are preserved in this vitally important masterpiece written by one of the most outstanding scholars of our time, Shaykh Muhammad Ibn Saalih al Uthaymeen. This new revised edition by Dar-us-Salam has been printed in full color with hardback bounding for an excellent presentation. Seven clear principles and their evidences from the Book and the Sunnah guide the reader through the confusion and false claims of the ignorant to the clarity of belief in Allah's Names accomplished by the righteous early scholars of Islam. Principle 6 contains the shaikh's compilation of the ninety-nine (99) names of Allah. The names have been compiled into 2 categories: first from the Book of Allah &amp; second from the Sunnah of the Prophet (S). All the names have been printed in Arabic with transliteration and English translation. Each name is printed beautifully in a square box with 6 boxes on a page. Seven more principles and their evidences follow, giving the reader firm understanding of the correct beliefs about Allah's Attributes. Four more principles outline the correct approach in studying the related proofs and evidences. All of this leads the reader into an enthralling series of refutations of the false notions of the Ash'aree sect, a text-by-text breakdown of how and why they went wrong in a careful and precise study of fifteen texts from the Book and the Sunnah. The beliefs of the Ash'aree sect are destroyed and the origins of their deviation are exposed for all to see. 'A magnificent book a clarification of the creed of the righteous Salaf concerning the Names and Attributes great principles and collective benefits concerning the topic' - Shaykh Ibn Baaz
