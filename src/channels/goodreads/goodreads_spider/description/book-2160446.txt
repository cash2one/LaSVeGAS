2160446:::::The Phantom's Opera:::::Known only as Erik Costanzi to the patrons of the Teatro dell'Opera and immersed in the world of music, the Phantom of the Opera believes his demons have been laid to rest. When a fire breaks out in the Teatro, Erik is thought to have died in the blaze. But he wakes-without memory and without an identity-in the arms of his former lover, Lucianna Fiortino. Given a chance to keep Erik to herself, Lucianna invents a fairy-tale past for him. She has him take the name of her dead husband, not realizing that she thus condemns him to live a fiction that spirals further and further out of control. Has Erik lost everything, including himself? Yet Meg cannot accept that her husband has died. She knows that the stranger who watches in the wings and sends her roses must be Erik. But someone else watches over both Erik and Meg, waiting for another chance at revenge. Only the Phantom can save them. Book III in the "Phoenix of the Opera" series, "The Phantom's Opera" continues the story begun in "The Phoenix of the Opera" and "Out of the Darkness: The Phantom's Journey."
