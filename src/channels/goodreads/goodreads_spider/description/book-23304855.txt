23304855:::::On the Other Hand: The Little Anthology of Big Questions:::::A straight from the shoulder look at life in which the author asks some awkward questions we might prefer to swat away like an annoying fly. Questions like: Who am I? What is this life about? What is the mind? Why do we resist change? These are the questions we lock away in a tall tower like some inconvenient relative whose lost her marbles and become an embarrassment to the family. Perhaps you ve been asking comfortable questions and avoiding the hard-hitting ones, preferring to hide away from them and pretend they don t exist. We hope someone, somewhere, will put it all right for us. They won t! This book is not for the faint of heart as it brings you face to face with yourself, but not the one you see when you look in the mirror. If you ve locked yourself up in protective custody and thrown away the key, this book could well pick the lock and let you out again - if you re ready to be let out. There s something wonderful to discover if we care to take a look. If you re prepared to be honest when thinking about the questions raised in this book and to be your own harshest critic, then pop over to the cash desk or place it in your basket online and, go for it. You re not alone and help is always available - far closer than you can imagine. Unlike my other books, On The Other Hand is not illustrated.
