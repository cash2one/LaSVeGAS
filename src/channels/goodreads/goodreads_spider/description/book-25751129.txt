25751129:::::Kaja Star: No Place Like Home:::::On the day Titus Markava plans to propose, he is horrified to discover that the love of his life is actually a shape-shifting alien man. Before he can recover from the unfortunate news, he is quite literally thrown from Earth onto a completely different world in a completely different solar system. It is a world where a person might conduct himself almost as well as he conducts electricity. It is a world on the brink of an interplanetary conflict. It is a world of dinosoids, insectavores, and even a cyborg or two. It is a world with CNN just not quite the same CNN we re used to. Yet even though it is a world where entire planets can be traversed instantly by portals called gates, Titus can t find even one to take him back home.
