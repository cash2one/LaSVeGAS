35396707:::::From The Falls:::::Arvata is thriving and Kali is finally getting a handle on being an Elder. She s been learning her Arelia abilities, while enjoying being a newlywed. The only thing missing from Arvata is their town healer, who left a year ago and didn t tell anyone why. Lorelle finally returns and explains to the Elders what the Fates had assigned to her, but she now needs their help with the mission. Half-Guardians, that shouldn t even exist in their world, are out there and need to be protected, but time is running out. Dark magic lurks within these hybrids and nobody knows how they came to be. They possess powers unlike full Guardians and it s up to Kali and her friends to figure out how to protect the half-Guardians and prevent more from being created. Trust will need to be earned, unseen powers will emerge and loved one s lives are threatened. Will the risk be worth it in the end?
