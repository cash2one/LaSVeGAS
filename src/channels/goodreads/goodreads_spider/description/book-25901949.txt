Tired of being abandoned - first by her globetrotting parents and then by her boyfriend, Ethan Lockwood. Now in her final year of college, she comes up with a plan to avoid rejection - stay away from commitment by remaining single and concentrate on the only thing that deserves her attention, her studies. Determined to stick to her rules, she has no idea what hits her when fate intervenes in the form of devastatingly handsome but troubled Luke Greyson, who enrols at Midland Falls University and turns her world upside down. Unable to deny her attraction, she finds herself falling for him but unable to commit. Unlike her, Luke does not seem to have commitment issues. However, he does seem to have secrets that slowly start to unravel. Will Emma be able to let go of her fears and give herself completely to Luke or will she let her past dictate her future? Or will his secrets come between them and destroy their relationship? And Luke will do anything for her to never find out...
