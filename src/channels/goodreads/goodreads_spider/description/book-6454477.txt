6454477:::::The Red Book: Liber Novus:::::When Carl Jung embarked on an extended self-exploration he called it his confrontation with the unconscious, the heart of it was The Red Book , a large, illuminated volume he created between 1914 and 1930. Here he developed his principle theories of the archetypes, the collective unconscious, and the process of individuation that transformed psychotherapy from a practice concerned with treatment of the sick into a means for higher development of the personality. While Jung considered The Red Book to be his most important work, only a handful of people have ever seen it. Now, in a complete facsimile and translation, it is available to scholars and the general public. It is an astonishing example of calligraphy and art on a par with The Book of Kells and the illuminated manuscripts of William Blake. This publication of The Red Book is a watershed that will cast new light on the making of modern psychology. 212 color illustrations.
