Thorne McKelvey knows exactly how Nadia sees him as a brute and a killer just kinky enough to play her sexy games. And that s how it has to stay. Leaving her was the hardest thing he ever did, but his undercover mission could blow up at any second. No way will he drag Nadia down with him. SHE CAN T RISK HER HEART. Maybe it was foolish to fall in love with her late father s deadliest henchman, but Nadia Volkov s not sorry; without Thorne she wouldn t have their beautiful little boy. There s nothing she won t do to protect Benny, which means she must hide his identity especially from his father. Now Thorne has burst back into her home, searching for clues to a gangland mystery and stirring a hunger Nadia hasn t felt in two years. But Benny s identity isn t the only secret she s keeping, and things are turning deadly. Can Thorne and Nadia trust each other long enough to stay alive and have a chance at happiness?
