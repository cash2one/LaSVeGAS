Nine months ago, the power and wealth of the now-dissolved Androfancine Order passed into the hands of Rudolfo, General of the Wandering Army and Lord of the Ninefold Forest Houses. Nine months ago, his consort, Jin Li Tam, told him that she was finally with child and he would have an heir. Nine months ago, Rudolfo and Isaak began the arduous task of transcribing the books and records from the devastated city of Windwir that were stored in the memories of the mechoservitors, and collecting whatever books remained in the Named Lands into a new Great Library.

Jin Li Tam lies in childbed, laboring to give birth As the feast begins, the doors of the hall fly open and magicked, invisible assassins attack. The Gypsy Scouts are unable to fight them off, and all of Rudolfo s noble guests are slain, including Hanric, the Marsh Queen s Shadow. And yet Rudolfo himself is not touched.

Thus begins the second movement of The Psalms of Isaak, Canticle .
