368822:::::Travels with Charley: In Search of America:::::A quest across America, from the northernmost tip of Maine to California s Monterey Peninsula To hear the speech of the real America, to smell the grass and trees, to see the colors and the light these were John Steinbeck s goals as he set out, at the age of fifty-eight, to rediscover the country he had been writing about for so many years. With Charley, his French poodle, Steinbeck drives the interstates and the country roads, dines with truckers, encounters bears at Yellowstone and old friends in San Francisco. As he reflects on the American character, racial hostility, on a particular form of American loneliness he finds almost everywhere, and on the unexpected kindness of strangers that is also a very real part of our national identity.
