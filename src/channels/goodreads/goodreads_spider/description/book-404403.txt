404403:::::Maid Marian:::::An irresistible reimagining of the Robin Hood legend, Maid Marian brings to life the rollicking and romantic world of the Middle Ages. An orphan and heiress to a large country estate, Marian Fitzwater is wed at the age of five to an equally young nobleman, Lord Hugh of Sencaster, a union that joins her inheritance to his. But when she is seventeen, Lord Hugh, whom she hasn t seen in years, dies under mysterious circumstances. Marian is left alone again a widow who has never been a bride. But now, like all unmarried young ladies of fortune, she is made the ward of King Richard the Lionheart. Since Richard is away on Crusade, Marian s fate lies in the hands of his mother, the formidable Queen Eleanor of Aquitaine. The bridegroom Eleanor selects will get Marian s lands and, in return, pledge his loyalty and silver to the king. Marian herself is irrelevant and she knows it. Determined not to be sold into another sham marriage, she seeks out the one man who can help uncover the queen s intentions: Robin Hood, the notorious Saxon outlaw of Sherwood Forest. Marian is surprised to discover that the famed prince of thieves is not only helpful but handsome, likeable, and sympathetic to her plight. Robin s men intercept a letter from Queen Eleanor, from which Marian learns, to her horror, that she is to marry her late husband s brother. His family has a history of mysterious deaths, and Marian knows she is in danger. Once married, she can be easily disposed of a fate she may have escaped once already. On the eve of her wedding, Robin Hood spirits Marian back to the forest. The Queen believes her to be dead, and Marian begins a new life with Robin Hood s outlaws, who pledge to help her regain her fortune and expose the treachery of her enemies.
