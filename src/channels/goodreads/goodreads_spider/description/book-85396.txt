85396:::::Licks of Love: Short Stories and a Sequel, "Rabbit Remembered":::::In this brilliant late-career collection, John Updike revisits many of the locales of his early fiction: the small-town Pennsylvania of Olinger Stories , the sandstone farmhouse of Of the Farm , the exurban New England of Couples and Marry Me , and Henry Bech s Manhattan of artistic ambition and taunting glamour. To a dozen short stories spanning the American Century, the author has added a novella-length coda to his quartet of novels about Harry Rabbit Angstrom. Several strands of the Rabbit saga come together here as, during the fall and winter holidays of 1999, Harry s survivors fitfully entertain his memory while pursuing their own happiness up to the edge of a new millennium. Love makes Updike s fictional world go round married love, filial love, feathery licks of erotic love, and love for the domestic particulars of Middle American life.
