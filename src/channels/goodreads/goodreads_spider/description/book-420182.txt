420182:::::The Rosemary Tree:::::Michael Stone was once a famous author. That was before he went to prison. Now, just released, he needs to get his bearings. It was a gray day in early April when Michael stumbled wearily into the tiny English village. Even though his heart was torn by remorse and shame, he was home at last. In the village of Belmaray he finds much to muse on...a former sweetheart who has married the kindly vicar, a young schoolmistress, shopkeepers and children, animals and nature. With Michaels' arrival at Belmaray, changes began to occur in lives that had not changed for so long: the proud, self-centered beauty he had once loved was surprised into forgiveness; the quixotic bumbling vicar discovered unsuspected strength lurking behind his shyness; a sick and lonely spinster was turned away from despair, and a lovely, high-spirited young woman found her heart's desire.
