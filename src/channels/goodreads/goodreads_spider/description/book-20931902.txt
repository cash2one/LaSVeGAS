She delivers the strikes that enforce their obedience. She delivers the sexual training that determines their purchase price.

And her stubborn slave thinks he can deliver her...from herself. DELIVER series (HEAs with no cliffhangers - must be read in order): Deliver #1 Vanquish #2 Disclaim #3 Devastate #4
