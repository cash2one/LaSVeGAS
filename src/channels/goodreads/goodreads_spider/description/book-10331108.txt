10331108:::::Plugged:::::Daniel McEvoy is a scarred ex-Irish Army sergeant who is now the bouncer at Slotz, a seedy small-time casino and he has a problem. His favorite hostess and love interest, Connie, was murdered in the parking lot behind the club. And Zeb, the dubious plastic surgeon who implanted McEvoy's hair plugs, has disappeared. In no time at all McEvoy's got half the New Jersey mob, dirty cops and his man-crazy upstairs neighbor after him. Bullets are flying, everyone's on the take, and McEvoy still doesn't have a clue about what's happening.
