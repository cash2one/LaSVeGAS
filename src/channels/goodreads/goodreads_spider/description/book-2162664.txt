2162664:::::The Kissing Diary:::::Twelve-year-old Rosie Goldglitt is a never-been-kissed, hopeless romantic. Her mother has a new boyfriend. So why can't Rosie attract the attentions of the cutest boy in the seventh grade, Robbie Romano? Is it because she's two inches taller than he is? Is it her horrible name? Or is she simply a dork? If only she could be more like her rival, the perfect and popular Mary Katz, then maybe Robbie would notice her. As Rosie navigates the ups and downs of adolescence, she eagerly anticipates the experience of a first kiss - when she's not completely grossed out at the thought of it. But by the time the big dance rolls around, Rosie manages to surprise herself, in more ways than one. This perceptive and funny story captures the bittersweetness and euphoria of growing up, the messiness of having a crush, and how sometimes the most unexpected things in life are the most enjoyable.
