18960990:::::Roots:::::ROOTS - a metaphor and an acronym for the Christian life! A plant needs deep roots to provide it with an anchor during storms and flood, and nourishment, especially during droughts so it can thrive and produce good fruit. Roots are to a plant, what Relationship, Obedience, and Opportunities to minister, Truth and Salvation are to the Christian - anchor, nourishment and sustenance during the storms, flood and droughts of life. The goal of the book "ROOTS" is to inspire you to sow specific seeds of disciplines in your life so they can germinate and produce the strong and deep roots that can anchor and provide nourishment on your journey through this life. Every Christian can experience an Abundant Life -- a life filled with hope, a life filled with joy, a life filled with peace and a life filled with love; but, you need ROOTS to experience that kind of life! Endorsements Jerry &amp; Gwen Reese (General Manager of the 2007 and 2011 Super Bowl Champion the New York Giants). "Powerful...a book that is an answer to our quest in seeking abundant life filled with peace, hope and internal joy. The acronym "ROOTS" that Christopher has written of so eloquently well expresses our need to nurture our relationship with God, to realize the aptitude of our need to be obedient to His Word, to continuously seek the opportunities to minister and to know the truth that is evident in Scripture." Reverend Terrence E. Moss, Sr. Bible Teacher; Marriage Mentor; Relationship Builder President, One Flesh Ministries "Very thoughtful, mature, and insightful exegesis of such profound subject matter; I started reading this work as an observer, one preparing to provide feedback. As I read, I realized I had become a learner of real profound truth!"
