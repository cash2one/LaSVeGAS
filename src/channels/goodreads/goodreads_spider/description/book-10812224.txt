Delany One of the most influential anthologies of all time returns to print, as relevant now as when it was first published Anthologies seldom make history, but Harlan Ellison's 1967 collection of science fiction stories is a grand exception. Along with Moorcock's New Worlds , it defined the New Wave movement. Dangerous Visions set an almost impossibly high standard, as more than a half dozen of its stories won major awards not surprising with a contributors list that reads like a who's who of 20th-century SF.
