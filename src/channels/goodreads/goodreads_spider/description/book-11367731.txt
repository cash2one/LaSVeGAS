11367731:::::Devin:::::Devin Grant is having a crappy day. He lost his case, wrecked his car and got a ticket. Then instead of going straight home as he wants to, his brothers make him stop at a out of the way diner and have breakfast. He takes his rotten mood out on the pretty little waitress/cook. Ronnie Frey is working her way through law school and doesn't need crap from a rude gorgeous man. When Devin leaves her a huge tip, she tracks him down through his brother and returns it. Both of them are too stubborn and smart to give in until Devin shows her passion and love beyond anything she's ever known. Now a different kind of heat forms between them. Until Ronnie's family shows up and kidnaps Devin. Then hell hath no fury like a woman whose love is harmed.
