Within a year the town of Tombstone was filling up with merchants, tradesmen, gamblers, whores, and gunslingers. And then the Earp family came to Tombstone-five brothers with their women and their wives. Along with Doc Holliday and a band of thieves, Wyatt Earp treated the Arizona territory as his personal stomping grounds-until Wells Fargo decided to put an end to a string of savage stage robberies. With the legend of the OK Corral shootout fanning out across the frontier, private detective Luke Starbuck was sent to Tombstone to find the truth. And when he got there, Starbuck's mission turned into one burning, personal obsession: to kill Wyatt Earp....AUTHORBIO: MATT BRAUN is a fourth generation Westerner, steeped in the tradition and lore of the frontier era.
