5644886:::::Adored:::::Brett Messerschmidt is organizing Waverly Academy's annual holiday ball and secret gift exchange. But when some enterprising students decide that playing Secret "Satan "is infinitely more fun, the entire school starts acting naughty. All Brett wants is a successful party-and a goodnight kiss from unexpected crush Sebastian Valenti. Too bad Callie Vernon also has her eye on the newly made-over Sebastian. Sharing is caring, right? Or not . . . Everybody at Waverly is getting into the giving spirit. The only present Tinsley Carmichael wants to unwrap is her new boyfriend, Julian McCafferty. But what happens when she uncovers a shady secret from his past instead? Looks like Jenny Humphrey, Waverly's newest small-screen star, is about to land on Tinsley's hit list. Again. With raucous get-togethers and secret admirers, there's never a dull day in the life of an It Girl. But no one ever said being adored was easy. . . .
