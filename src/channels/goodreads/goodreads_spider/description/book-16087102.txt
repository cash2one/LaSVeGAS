16087102:::::Shaman of Stonewylde:::::The thrilling finale to the Stonewylde series Disaster has struck. Is this the end for Stonewylde? The community's golden age is over. Now, with their new business in tatters, Yul and Sylvie increasingly estranged and Clip making plans to leave for good, darkness has taken hold of Stonewylde. There is a glimmer of light in the darkness. Leveret's affinity for magic and for healing is blossoming and, alongside it, so is Magpie's art, but as the community's woes grow these are small consolations. Magic is fading from their lives and as the Outside World becomes more important to their survival, so it seems the magic may not return. Painful truths must be revealed, about past wrongs, old lies, and ongoing deceits, if broken relationships are to be mended. There are poisons which have festered for too long, and unless they are healed and soon the damage may prove too great to ever recover from.
