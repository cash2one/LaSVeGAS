20567018:::::Death Dreams Deluxe: The Complete Works of Chris Robertson:::::Alternate cover edition for ASIN: B00B0GV4MG DEATH DREAMS DELUXE includes every piece of horror and science fiction that I wrote from 2005-2013. Many people believe horror to be an inferior genre, but not I. Horror done well is really just drama taken to a higher, more primal level. The ideas for the stories in this book came from many sources: dreams and nightmares, waking fears, homages to my favorite films and books, imagination, and in one instance a voice heard telepathically during a night of insomnia.
