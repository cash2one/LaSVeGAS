106808:::::Chourmo:::::"A talented French writer who draws from the deep dark well of noir."-The Washington Post Chourmo . . . the rowers in a galley. In Marseilles, you weren't just from one neighborhood, one project. You were chourmo. In the same galley, rowing! Trying to get out. Together. In this second installment of Jean-Claude Izzo's legendary Marseilles Trilogy-which includes Total Chaos, Chourmo, and Solea-Fabio Montale has left a police force riddled with corruption, racism, and greed to follow the ancient rhythms of his native town: the sea, fishing, the local bar, hotly contested games of belote. But his cousin's son has gone missing, and Montale is dragged back onto the mean streets of a violent, crime-infested Marseilles.
