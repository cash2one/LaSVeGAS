923856:::::Pretty Tough:::::Bubbly, blond Krista Brown is pretty and popular. Her sister, Charlie, is more interested in braving the Malibu waves than the halls of the school that Krista rules. But when Krista and Charlie are both recruited to the school's soccer team, they are forced to face their differences. Can these two sisters become teammates, and friends, in time to make it to the championships? Classic themes of sisterhood and romance make Pretty Tough a new take on Francine Pascal's Sweet Valley High. The strong sports element and a tie-in to the Pretty Tough sportswear and entertainment franchise give this first book by Liz Tigelaar added appeal.
