15797028:::::The Albino Album:::::Emerging author Chavisa Woods has been noted for capturing a "strange, troubling vision of domestic life in the rural U.S." ( Go Magazine ). Here she presents a technicolored vision of rural adolescence, the story of a girl with an unpronounceable name---a fiery, unhinged, growling, big-hearted queer country girl in a dirty black tutu and combat boots who travels along all the bizarre yet familiar byways of human desire from the cornfields of Louisiana and the big brass sound of Mardi Gras to the heights of the Empire State Building. Turning the tradition of the southern gothic novel on its head, Woods presents a new land of contemporary misfits including fire-dancers, pseudo-Nazis who breed albino animals, Catholic workers, horse thieves, and the archangel Gabrielle. A bold exploration of the intersections of race, class, and sexuality, The Albino Album contemplates the relationships between political action, art and romance, as our heroine tries on a series of bewitchingly fantastical families looking for the place to call home.
