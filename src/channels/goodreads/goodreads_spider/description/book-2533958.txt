2533958:::::Frost/Nixon:::::Including hilarious tales of the people he encountered along the way and fascinating insights into the making of the television series itself, this is Sir David's own story of his pursuit of disgraced ex-President Richard Nixon one that is no less revealing of his own toughness and pertinacity than of the ex-President's elusiveness. Frost provides an account of the only public trial that Nixon will ever have, and a revelation of the man's character as it appeared in the stress of eleven gruelling sessions before the cameras. Fully revised and updated with historical perspective, and including transcripts of the edited interviews, Frost/Nixon describes Sir David Frost's quest to produce one of the most dramatic pieces of television ever broadcast.
