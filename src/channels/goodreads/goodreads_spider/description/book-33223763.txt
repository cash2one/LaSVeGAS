33223763:::::Born of Water:::::Everything you thought you knew about mermaids is wrong. Life for a small-town high school kid in Saltford should be simple and straightforward - for 17-year-old Targa MacAuley, it's anything but. Navigating life with a supernatural mother is tricky enough, but dealing with the feelings of guilt that she's never been able to 'change', and confusion that she doesn't seem to be attracted to boys (or girls for that matter), Targa feels like she's got more demons than the average kid. When the opportunity to salvage a mysterious wreck in the Baltic arises for her mom, a professional salvage diver by day, Targa jumps at the chance to go abroad for the summer. But it's when she meets Antoni Baranek, and a boating accident puts them both in danger, that Targa's world turns completely inside out in more ways than one.
