2275614:::::As Time Goes By:::::As Time Goes By is a 387 hardbound book written by Jerry Borrowman. It is a World War II Novel - Battle of Britain. As German bombs fall over London and England is drawn into war, members of the Carlyle family are forced to make choices that will deeply affect their lives-and the lives of thousands of others. Family patriarch Philip, a member of the House of Lords and a confidant of Winston Churchill, has been struggling for the esteem of his peers since joining the LDS Church. As he slowly gains acceptance, little does Philip realize there is someone very close to him who would like to see him destroyed-even if it means taking the entire country down with him. As the Carlyles scatter across three continents, family divisions hewn by supposed political beliefs grow wider than the geographical distance that separates them, and it seems the family will never be together again. In this time when safety is only momentary, for one member of the Carlyle family perhaps the most dangerous enemy is himself.
