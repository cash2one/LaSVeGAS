17451252:::::Infernal Machines:::::Paulie and Stoner aren t bad seeds; they re just a little too smart for their own good. They stole their first car in kindergarten, and as for the homemade rocket launcher in Stoner s garage well, it s best just not to ask. With 9th grade just around the corner, Paulie and Stoner find themselves on the wrong side of some real bad kids, an older band of w hite supremacists that go by the name of Twisted Cross. When a rumble at a high school keg party turns fatal, it sets off a chain of events that test the limits of Paulie and Stoner s friendship, and their very sanity. Welcome to Chapel Harbor, a town where everybody buries their secrets deep, and nobody is quite who they seem. A town where the ghost of a serial killer known as The Junkman is rumored to stalk the woods at night, and where an unassuming magic shop and its mysterious proprietor, Arthur Cardiff, may possess the key to an ancient and terrible evil. Packed with hairpin turns and twists that will keep you guessing until the very last page, Infernal Machines is a blood drenched, adrenaline fueled, roller-coaster of a horror story that s at once a paean to the Pulp Horror classics of the early 80 s and a meditation on the enduring power of friendship.
