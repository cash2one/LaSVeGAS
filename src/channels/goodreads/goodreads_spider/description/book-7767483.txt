7767483:::::Leviathan Wept and Other Stories:::::What if you had a holocaust and nobody came? Imagine a father who has sent his child's soul voyaging and seen it go astray. Or a backyard tale from the 1001 American Nights. Macbeth re-imagined as a screwball comedy. Three extraordinary economic tasks performed by a small expert in currency exchange that risk first career and then life and then soul. From the disturbing beauty of 'Flat Diane' (Nebula-nominee, International Horror Guild award-winner) to the idiosyncratic vision of 'The Cambist and Lord Iron' (Hugo- and World Fantasy-nominee), Daniel Abraham has been writing some of the most enjoyable and widely admired short fiction in the genre for over a decade. Ranging from high fantasy to hard science fiction, screwball comedy to gut-punching tragedy, Daniel Abraham's stories never fail to be intelligent, compassionate, thoughtful, and humane. Leviathan Wept and Other Stories is the first collection of his short works, including selections from both the well-known and the rare. Contents: The Cambist and Lord Iron (2007) Flat Diane (2004) The Best Monkey (2009) The Support Technician Tango (2007) A Hunter in Arin-Quin (2010) Leviathan Wept (2004) Exclusion (2001) As Sweet (2001) The Curandero and the Swede (2010)
