18464372:::::Her Forbidden Rockstar:::::The second book in the Forbidden Rockers series from bestselling author Sarah Robinson, Her Forbidden Rocker is a gritty story of triumph and failure as one man risks everything he's ever worked for to have a chance at true love. Logan Clay has never met a woman who wasn't only after the perks his rockstar life could provide, and there are a lot of perks. Women, money, fame...it's all he ever wanted. Until he meets Caroline Sanders. Not only does she want for nothing, but she doesn't want anything to do with him, period. He sure as hell wants her, but convincing her to take a chance on him requires risking everything he's ever worked for...including his music. It's a chance at a love he never thought he'd have. And a chance at freedom he's not sure he deserves. If only she'd say yes. DISCLAIMER: This book was originally published in September 2013 with the title "Sand &amp; Clay" by Sarah Robinson. Since then it has been re-edited, a few short scenes here and there added in, and given a new title and a new cover in order to improve the novel. This is the OLD version. This novel is meant for 18+ years old.
