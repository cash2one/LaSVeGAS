17692997:::::Debt Paid:::::Dominic loves owning a motel. He never knows one day to the next what might come through the doors, but no matter what it is, he is ready. Dominic is a voyeur extreme and has installed cameras in every room of the motel. Not everyone is there to sleep. Come join him and find out just who is staying at the Desert Inn tonight. Reggie leads a large biker gang and he doesn't take crap from anyone. When Terry doesn't pay what he owes, Reggie brings Sam with him to the motel to collect payment. It's no surprise that Terry doesn't have the money he owes, but Reggie is willing to let him work off the balance. Terry begs for another option, but it soon becomes clear what Reggie wants, Reggie gets.
