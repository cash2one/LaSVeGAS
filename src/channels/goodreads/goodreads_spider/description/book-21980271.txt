21980271:::::Inferno:::::The lines are drawn. After stumbling across news of Project Blue and all it entails, Sebastian is left reeling. He realizes the world as he knows it and the lives of everyone he loves now hangs in a delicate balance. Bit by bit, new pieces come into play and it seems following Marx s orders are the only way to survive the potential aftermath but at what cost? If the ruthless commander succeeds, SKALS will become an all-consuming regime that brings the world to its knees. If he rebels, Marx will kill him and go after everyone he loves, including Taylor and their unborn child. But the burden of guilt rests heavy. The brief glimpses of life and love he s experienced have opened the jaded agent s eyes and he can t help but wonder, with SKALS at the helm, what kind of existence would anyone lead? No matter which path Sebastian chooses, he stands to lose everything he s ever loved. Taylor is in more danger than ever, and with other government agencies closing in, he quickly discovers there is nowhere to run nowhere to turn. Resolve will crumble. Alliances will shift, and SKALS will be torn apart from the inside out. Their life is in violent upheaval, but there is no looking back. No second chances. In order to save himself and the woman he loves, Sebastian might have to take a final stance against Marx and the brutal organization he leads, but taking the man down won t be easy. As the drums of war beat louder, only time will tell who, and what, will remain standing in the end. Welcome to SKALS, cupcake. I suggest you strap yourself in. You ve just entered the ninth circle of hell. ~ Agent Josh Reevers - Edge of Obsession
