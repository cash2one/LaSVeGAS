15544715:::::Love Irresistibly:::::HE S USED TO GETTING WHAT HE WANTS A former football star and one of Chicago s top prosecutors, Assistant U.S. Attorney Cade Morgan will do anything to nail a corrupt state senator, which means he needs Brooke Parker s help. As general counsel for a restaurant company, she can get a bug to the senator s table at one of her five-star restaurants so the FBI can eavesdrop on him. All Cade has to do is convince Brooke to cooperate and he s not afraid to use a little charm, or the power of his office, to do just that. AND WHAT HE WANTS IS HER. A savvy businesswoman, Brooke knows she needs to play ball with the U.S. Attorney s office even if it means working with Cade. No doubt there s a sizzling attraction beneath all their sarcastic quips, but Brooke is determined to keep things casual. Cade agrees until a surprising turn of events throws his life into turmoil, and he realizes that he wants more than just a good time from the one woman with whom he could fall terrifyingly, irresistibly in love . . .
