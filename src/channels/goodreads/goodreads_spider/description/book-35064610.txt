35064610:::::Huntress:::::No one s afterlife is as dispiriting as Audrey s at least that s what she believes after waking up dead without her memories and being promptly assigned to hunt demons for the rest of eternity. She s convinced God s made a cosmic mistake; after all, she d rather discuss the color of her nails than break them on angelic weapons. It doesn t help that her trainer, Logan, is as infuriating as he is attractive. And just when Audrey and Logan appear close to developing an amicable relationship, a decision made under duress pushes their hearts in a direction neither of them saw coming. Despite her sub-par fighting abilities, an ancient weapon of unparalleled power chooses Audrey as its wielder, attracting the cautious gazes of her fellow hunters and the attention of Satan himself. With Satan s eyes now fixed on Audrey, a battle for the safety of the living looms in the shadows.
