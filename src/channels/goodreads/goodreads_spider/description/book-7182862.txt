7182862:::::Raising Real Men: Surviving, Teaching and Appreciating Boys:::::"Six boys!" folks say in mock horror, "Well, better you than me." We answer them cheerfully - we love our boys and they're a gift from God...a reward. Privately, though, we admit to ourselves it's not always rosy. Teenaged boys put away a startling amount of groceries. Young boys can be downright destructive. They're noisy, unconcerned with personal hygiene, and the dog has a longer attention span - or so it seems, some days. If this is God's chosen gift to us, then why does it seem so hard? How can we prepare these boys to serve God when we can barely make it through the day. Isn't there a better way? The answer is yes . Raising Real Men looks beyond the untied shoes and dirty jeans to what the Lord means your son to be. Learn how to help him focus on schoolwork, find real heroes, stand alone when he needs to, and become a real man one day. Don t just survive raising boys, succeed at it and learn how to love them as they really are. " Raising Real Men is for real men who aspire to pass on a legacy of strength, courage and fidelity to Christ our King. It encouraged me as a father. I pray it will encourage you." Dr. R.C. Sproul, Jr., Author of When You Rise Up "Hal and Melane Young have six sons and are disciples of Jesus. They know how to raise real men. This book is a treasure trove of practical tips to help you to raise your sons right. It will answer your questions, help you avoid mistakes, bring them up in the Lord, and understand them. I highly recommend it." Chris Klicka, Author of The Right Choice and Homeschool Heroes
