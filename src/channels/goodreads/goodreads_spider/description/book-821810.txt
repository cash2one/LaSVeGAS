821810:::::A Small Killing:::::Moore and Zarate collaborate on a graphic novel full of irony and tension. Adman Timothy Hole is about to get a crack at the the big one: selling the diet drink sensation Flite to the U.S.S.R. Except someone wants him dead. Little murders, tiny betrayals, the small homicides with which we ease the passage of our lives - these are the stuff of 'A Small Killing'.
