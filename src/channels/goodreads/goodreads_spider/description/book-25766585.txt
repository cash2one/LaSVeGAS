25766585:::::Heartbound:::::ONE CHOICE HAS THE POWER TO CHANGE THE FATE OF TWO WORLDS Petyr has never found it necessary to consider the humans as anything more than distant, inferior beings until now. They are the cause of the fatal disease that has plagued his realm, taking the lives of too many of his kind. As a future leader of a realm in peril, Petyr must find a way to resist and cure the affliction. He must enter the unfamiliar realm, appear to be an ordinary eighteen year-old human, observe and learn. However, things don't exactly go according to plan. Instead of embarking single-mindlendly on his sober mission, Petyr meets and 18 year old girl who does things to his emotions that he can't quite fathom or control. Petyr is falling in love, and he almost forgets the gravity his choices have on his entire world. Despite the risk it poses to his life and hers, he wants to know her, and he wants her to know him and his world.
