6871358:::::Nearly Departed:::::Everything has a rational explanation . . . unless it doesn't. The creepy first book in a ghostly new series: Welcome to Weirdsville. "I've seen a ghost," said Emily. "Well, not seen one exactly. Heard one. At least, I think I have . . . " Woodsville is not like other towns. Night falls a little earlier there, the shadows are darker and denser, and everyone knows it's a place where strange things happen., even if they won't admit it. Bethan would prefer to be anywhere but here. Jay has his theories, but isn't ready to share. Hashim sees more than he'll say, while Kelly's demons are all too flesh and blood. But Emily's freak-out brings them out of denial and face to face with the supernatural. Anywhere else, Friday night would be date night. But not in Weirdsville.
