Her life gets exponentially more disastrous when her sixth-period history classmates start ogling a nude picture of her on the Internet.

Surrounded by disbelief and derision on all sides, Polarity desperately seeks the truth among her friends. Only then does she learn that everyone has dark secrets, and no one s life is anywhere near normal.
