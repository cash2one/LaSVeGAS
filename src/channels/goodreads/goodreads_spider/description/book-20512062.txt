20512062:::::Carnelian:::::Everyone has a past, but for most it isn t as long ago as Seth Sangre. His past is literally thousands of years ago. Seth s life led him to the present seeking something that might help him save his country from destruction. He has been in the present for over three years now and just found exactly what he has been looking for. Mari had dreams that college will be a fresh start, one where she would start over and not fall for the good looking player like high school. Unfortunately for her, that s exactly what ends up falling into her lap on the first day she moves into the dorms. Now she has to hold to her promise to herself and not fall for the handsome Seth. But he doesn t plan to make it easy for her. Seth has already marked her as his next conquest. As the semester progresses, Mari learns that Seth might just have a life of his own that s actually from the past. Suddenly Mari finds her future along with her past put into question. She s connected to Seth far more than she ever wanted to be and maybe the player isn t who she thought he was. If Mari can trust her heart enough to follow him, Seth will lead Mari on an adventure of a lifetime and reveal family secrets she never knew existed
