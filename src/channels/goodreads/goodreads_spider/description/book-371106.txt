Presumably it doesn t even bear that book cover. The actual release date of the new book has not been set as far as we know, nor has Judith announced the new title she has decided upon. New York Times bestselling author McNaught pens the story of a complex, charismatic man and a successful, spirited woman who in their youth fall in love, marry, and divorce--but years later are given a rare second chance to rediscover that love and rekindle their relationship.
