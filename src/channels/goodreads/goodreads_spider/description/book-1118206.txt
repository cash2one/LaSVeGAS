1118206:::::Fortunata and Jacinta:::::Capturing a ninteenth-century Spanish world of political tumult and personal obsession, Benito P rez Gald s's Fortunata and Jacinta tells of two women who love the same man unfailingly one as his mistress, the other as his wife. In this new and complete translation, Agnes Moncy Gull n presents the detailed realism, the diversity of character and scene that have placed Fortunata and Jacinta alongside the voluminous works of Charles Dickens and Honor de Balzac. Gald s's Madrid, recast from his youthful wanderings through the city's slums and caf s, includes the egg sellers and faded bullfighters surrounding Fortunata as well as the quieter, sequestered milieu of Jacinta's upbringing. Through Juanito, the lover of both women, the writer reveals Spain as a variegated fabric of delicate traditions and established vices, of shaky politics and rich intrigue. In this vast and colorful world, resonant of Dickens's London and Balzac's France, Gald s presents his characters with a depth, ambiguity, and humor born of the multiplicity of his scene. Gald s's novels enjoyed, for a time, a wide and attentive readership in Spain. As his reputation grew, however, hostility toward his achievements, envy of his success, and political squabbling hampered his progress, stalling his election to the Royal Academy and, in 1912, thoroughly derailing his nomination as Spain's candidate for the Nobel Prize. Though the political controversies that surrounded Gald s's works have long been calmed, this translation by Agnes Moncy Gull n brings alive the tempestuous era in which he lived and wrote, allowing English readers to hear the percussive yet often melodic tones of nineteenth-century Madrid in the correct and casual speech of Jacinta, in the pretty but empty words of Juanito, and in the painfully proper, sometimes vulgar language of Fortunata.
