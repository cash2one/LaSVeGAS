392337:::::A Lotus Grows in the Mud:::::With her trademark effervescence, Goldie delivers a personal look at private and powerful events that carried her through life: her father s spontaneity; her mother s courage; and the joy of being a daughter, a sister, a parent, and a lover. She writes about her childhood dreams of becoming a ballerina. She takes us on a tour of her go-go years in 1960s New York City, the phenomenon of TV s Rowan &amp; Martin s Laugh-In , her Oscar-winning debut in Cactus Flower and Hollywood stardom. She writes intimately about the challenges of love, anger and fear, and the importance of compassion and integrity. She speaks openly about her family, her partner Kurt Russell, her children; her faith, her curiosity for that which she doesn t yet know, and her thirst for knowledge. Most of all, it is a trip back through a life well lived by a woman well loved.
