There s a Guild of Godmothers in Everland, Wyoming, and they re prepared to meddle. They can t stand the thought of handsome, newly arrived Doctor Jack Carpenter raising his precious little daughter all by himself, and they re determined to find him a suitable wife. Luckily, they know just how to do it: take out an advertisement in a Mail-Order Bride catalog, and make sure that the perfect candidate sees it. Too bad they didn t mention the plan to Jack first. Meri Almassy is desperate for two things: to marry a doctor, and to get away from the Female Medical College of Pennsylvania, which is full of bad memories.

Jack is fighting his own past and he s determined to protect his daughter and his heart at all costs. Are Meri s dreams of a medical partnership and a Happily Ever After with her new family going to be more than this skittish father can handle? ************************************************ The Brides of Everland, Ever After Step into Everland, Wyoming, where the people on the street are always more than what they appear, and there s just a hint of magic in the air.
