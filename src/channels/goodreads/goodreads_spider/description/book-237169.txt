237169:::::The Birthright:::::The Thread Binding Them Together As Sisters Is All Too Fragile... The bittersweet reunion of the Robichaud family and the Harrows in the land of the Acadians has brought two mothers and two daughters full circle. They rekindle those early bonds and experience restoration of those lost years, but time and tragedy have left their indelible imprints on all who have endured the decades of separation and uncertainty. Moving forward with their lives now means further farewells--not as devastating as the one long ago, but no less heart wrenching. Their connection, which goes beyond that of "sisters" to best friends, will be tested by the coming Revolution and the lure of England--parted again, the reunited, but for how long...? Can their friendship sustain the startling revelation concerning...The Birthright?
