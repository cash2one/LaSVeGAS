28561468:::::The God of Great Reversals: The Gospel in the Book of Esther:::::Have you ever wondered, If God is real, then why doesn t He make it more obvious? If He really wants us to believe in Him, then why doesn t He make it easier for us to see him? It s easy to read the Bible and think, If only God would show up for us today the way He showed up for His people back then. If you have ever felt this way, welcome to the book of Esther. The God of Great Reversals was written to shed light on the Gospel story woven throughout the only book of the Bible that never mentions God s name. In it you will find that even in the darkest days, God never stops working to keep His promises and to rescue His people. Ultimately, the reversals in the book of Esther point us forward to the greatest reversal of all when God used the death of His only Son to bring about the salvation of all his people. It is only this great reversal that is able to bring us hope even when we don t understand where God is or what He is doing.
