24572226:::::Excess of Being:::::Lera Auerbach, the Russian-American composer, writer, visual artist and concert pianist who performs regularly in major halls throughout the world, has published more than 120 works for orchestra, opera and ballet, as well as choral and chamber music. Her work is championed worldwide by leading artists, conductors, stage directors and choreographers. The World Economic Forum selected Auerbach in 2007 as a Young Global Leader and in 2014 as a Cultural Leader, inviting her to give presentations on the fascinating topic of borderless creativity. In Excess of Being, she revitalizes the form of aphorisms. Her writing is dark, ironic and humorous, perceptively dealing with the excess of existence and what it means to be human. The book is interspersed with 117 intriguing color plates featuring Auerbach's original artwork on antique metal roof tiles. This is her first book in English. "The real subject is your mind in motion - and your ear - and your nervous system... an inspiring experience." David Lehman, poet, editor of The Best American Poetry series and the Oxford Book of American Poetry "A terrific read and a great companion, the kind of book that lovers of music and poetry will want to keep by their bedsides." Thomas McCarthy, poet, novelist and critic, author of The Sorrow Garden and The Last Geraldine Officer "Lera Auerbach's aphorisms are an open window on her mind, one of the best and busiest minds around just now." John Matthias, poet, editor of The Notre Dame Review "Brilliant aphorisms. Gorgeous graphic art." Dmitry Gutov, visual artist On life: Do not argue with idiots; they will outsmart you. On attitude: If you are a big ship, stay away from shallow waters. On authorship: It's not fully yours until you have shortened it. On visibility: If you are a reflective surface you remain unseen. On sex: Desirable frictions inevitably leading to undesirable frictions.
