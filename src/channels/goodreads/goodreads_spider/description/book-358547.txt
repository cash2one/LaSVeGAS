358547:::::Deserter from Death: Dispatches from Western Europe 1950-2000:::::A "deserter from death," Polish-born Daniel Singer narrowly escaped the Holocaust to become one of the left's leading social and political commentators of our time. Deserter from Death collects Singer's writing, from when he was a young correspondent for The Economist to his years at The Nation. Much of the material will be new (and a revelation) to Singer's followers, including his coverage of the Algerian crisis in the late fifties and the effervescent events of May '68. Deserter from Death is a social history of the past half-century, a memorial to one of our great correspondents, and a reminder of what we lost when we lost Daniel Singer. Showcasing Singer's writing over the course of his long and illustrious career, this collection is introduced by his old friend, the great polymath and intellectual George Steiner.
