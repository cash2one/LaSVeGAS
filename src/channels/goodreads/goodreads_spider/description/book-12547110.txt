12547110:::::Honor Redeemed:::::Highly skilled Search and Rescue (SAR) team leader, Honor Mackenzie, works almost as hard at guarding the dark secrets of her past as she does when training SAR dogs. As for widowed Sun reporter Matt Phillips, not even his former SAR work is as important as protecting his ten-year-old twin boys. When a jumbo jet crashes outside Baltimore one cold night, their respective jobs put them face-to-face at the grisly scene--and force Matt and Honor to reconsider the difficult decisions that resulted in their long-standing "single forever" status. As Matt tries to come to terms with his feelings for Honor, he gets word that she hasn t reported in since starting the search for a missing child. Reverting to his SAR training, Matt leads the search team as a vicious winter storm bears down on the area. Will he find her in time? And if he does, will they find their way back to each other or go back to living life alone? " Honor Redeemed takes readers into the challenging--and often heartbreaking--world of emergency responders who enter disaster and find their lives and choices irrevocably changed by it. A timely novel about the power of love in all its aspects." --Susannah Charleson, author of Scent of the Missing: Love and Partnership with a Search and Rescue Dog
