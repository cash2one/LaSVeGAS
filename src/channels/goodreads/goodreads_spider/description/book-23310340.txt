23310340:::::Sinful Desires: Vol. II:::::I wasn't entirely sure why I'd accepted Brock's invitation to be his date for his sister's wedding. A wedding to a man who'd confessed that he didn't love his wife-to-be. All I knew was that I didn't belong in that world. When Piper Black returned to Philadelphia to attend the wedding of the man who'd broken her heart, she never imagined that she'd end up falling for her date...who just happened to be Reed Stirling's new brother-in-law. Will Brock Michaels be able to heal Piper's heart or will her connection to Reed tear apart more than one relationship? The second volume in M.S. Parker's sizzling Sinful Desires series isn't to be missed.
