1090876:::::Collected Stories of Bertrand Russell:::::This volume presents a complete collection of Bertrand Russell's stories, both published and unpublished, fictional and factual. After the publication of Satan in the Suburbs, his first book of short stories, Russell quipped: "I have devoted my first eighty years of my life to philosophy, and propose to devote the next eighty years to another branch of fiction." Also included here, for the first time, is the novella The Perplexities of John Forstice, along with Russell's intimate anecdotes and the fables created for the amusement of his own children. With the elegance and lucidity of stile that won him the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1950, this volume gives a sparkling demonstration of Russell's humanity, his sense of fun, and his delighted perception of absurdity.
