593038:::::Revealed:::::Words, once spoken, can mend a broken life or cripple it. But words left unspoken can haunt the soul, inflicting a far deeper wound.

Matthew Taylor is a man on the run, with consequences of past mistakes pursuing him at every turn.

If given a single wish, Matthew would turn back time and right a grievous wrong. If given a second wish, he would make Annabelle Grayson pay.
