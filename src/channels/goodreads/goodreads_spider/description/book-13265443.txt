13265443:::::How Miss Rutherford Got Her Groove Back:::::Emily Rutherford is having a very bad day. Of course, having the man you ve loved forever announce his engagement to your (now very former) best friend will do that. Emily is sure nothing good could possibly come out of this horrid situation. But she lets her sisters along with Francis Riley, the delectable but brooding Earl of Dunhurst convince her that a season in London will be just the thing. Now Emily has a choice: sulk in a corner while her sisters enjoy the glitter of the ton . . . or become the belle of the ball, dazzling everyone on an earl s arm. But as Francis helps Emily get back on her feet, she quickly realizes that a childhood crush is nothing compared to the power of true love.
