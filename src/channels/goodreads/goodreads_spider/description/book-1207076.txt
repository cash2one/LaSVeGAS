1207076:::::Snow Ride:::::When Stevie is invited to Vermont to visit her friend Dinah for the annual sugaring-off event, she's not sure that she wants to leave the rest of The Saddle Club behind. But then she finds out that Dinah's riding class is having a contest to see which team can gather the most sap, and Stevie can't resist the challenge. She's also thrilled to learn that Dinah has arranged for the two of them to ride the Rocky Road trail, a difficult but beautiful trail that's off-limits to certain riders. Dinah isn't exactly experienced enough for the trail, but she convinces Stevie to help her, and they both promise not to tell a soul. When an accident happens on the Rocky Road trail, Stevie knows that they have made a mistake. But what should she do: keep the secret or tell the truth?
