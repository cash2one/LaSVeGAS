13115184:::::Report from Planet Midnight:::::Infused with feminist, Afro-Caribbean views of the science fiction and fantasy genres, this collection of offbeat and highly original works takes aim at race and racism in literature. In Report from Planet Midnight, at the International Association of the Fantastic in the Arts, an alien addresses the crowd, evaluating Earth's "strange" customs, including the marginalization of works by nonwhite and female writers. Message in a Bottle shows Greg, an American Indian artist, befriending a strange four-year-old who seems wise beyond her years. While preparing an exhibition, he discovers that the young girl is a traveler from the future sent to recover art from the distant past which apparently includes his own work. Concluding the book with series editor Terry Bisson s Outspoken Interview, Nalo Hopkinson shares laughs, loves, and top-secret Caribbean spells.
