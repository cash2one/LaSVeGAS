2251629:::::The Adventures of Herge: Creator of Tintin:::::In this anniversary portrait Michael Farr reveals the complex personality of Herge, the remarkable artist behind Tintin, the boy reporter who continues to thrill and delight an ever-widening audience. In seven separate sketches Farr presents a picture of a man whose life is the key to his creation. First introduced in 1929, The Adventures of Tinin remains a constant source of reference throughout this new book, which draws on fresh material found in the extensive archive of Studios Herge, and from interviews with those who knew Herge intimately. Generously illustrated, it examines the life and passions of a man who, despite his international fame, preferred to avoid the limelight, finding inspiration in modern art, the latest scientific developments and world affairs, and seeking enlightenment in Zen Buddhism and philosophy. It considers his role as the European pioneer of the strip cartoon, and establishes his role developing contemporary cinema.
