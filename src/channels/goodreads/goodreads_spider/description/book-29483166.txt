29483166:::::The Grey Woods:::::The Grey Woods is a meeting place between worlds, where souls go after they die, where they come before they are born. Here, the powerful Lady Atya of the Majae draws Fin Goldvale into this spiritual realm to witness past events that hold the key to his future. But Fin is caught between his cousin Madros present turmoil and his past love for the enchanting Eam n of the Majae. In order to ensure their very survival, Fin must navigate Lord Madros growing madness by understanding the heroic deeds of his past. Madros was forced to send his beloved Eam n to a remote city where his cousin Gareth is king. Fin was sent with her to protect her from the dark forces ever searching for her power, but more importantly, from Gareth himself. But Fin is accused of an affair with Eam n, who has been forced to marry Gareth while in hiding, and he escapes to Madros city with the heartbreaking news that she is no longer safe there. But pulling her out of the hidden city will expose her again to the Lord of the Dream Realm, who Madros is ultimately protecting her from. Madros must decide if leaving Eam n in Gareth s clutches is the lesser of two evils, or will the guilt of how she suffers in Gareth s hands drive him to choose another option so deadly, in an attempt to rid both threats to her. Time is an infinite loop, expanding, contracting and repeating again, and this tale weaves itself through a series of parallel events happening three years apart. In the end Fin finds himself standing between Madros and Eam n, two people he s sworn to love and protect, and deciding which to serve.
