I never imagined one chance meeting on the eve of my eighteenth birthday could change my life so completely. Now I belong to him. To Julian. To a man who is as ruthless as he is beautiful a man whose touch makes me burn. A man whose tenderness I find more devastating than his cruelty. My captor is an enigma. I don t know who he is or why he took me. There is a darkness inside him a darkness that scares me even as it draws me in. My name is Nora Leston, and this is my story. ***Note: This is book 1 of a completed trilogy. Keep Me and Hold Me are now available everywhere. No cliffhanger.***
