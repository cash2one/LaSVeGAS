6288940:::::What a Dragon Should Know:::::Attraction that s off the scale Only for those I love would I traipse into the merciless Northlands to risk life, limb, and my exquisite beauty.

So here I stand, waiting to broker an alliance with the one the Northlanders call The Beast. A being so fearful, the greatest warriors will only whisper its name.

Beneath her plain robes and prim spectacles lies a sensual creature waiting to be unleashed. Who better than a dragon to thaw out that icy demeanor? And who better than a beast to finally tame a mighty dragon s heart?
