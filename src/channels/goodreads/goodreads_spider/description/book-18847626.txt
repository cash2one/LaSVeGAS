The first book immediately hit #1 in the Amish genre as well as an Amazon Top 100 within days. In Book 2 of the series, readers will continue following the story of four Amish sisters who run Whoopie Pie Place, the best known bakery outside of Berlin, Ohio. Each sister has a secret that influences their lives and, unknowingly, impacts each other. Yet, little by little, the pressure of balancing their responsibilities of their daily lives with their individual secrets becomes harder to manage. Leah, Susan, Lydia, and Sadie need to decide whether or not to confide in each other in order to gain the support of their family. As secrets begin to be revealed, more problems ensue. Can Leah continue to hold the family together? Will Susie address her issues at home? Will Lydia admit what everyone else knows? How can Sadie maintain her balance when faced with life-changing decisions? The Divine Secrets of the Whoopie Pie Sisters is a different type of Amish Christian story. By blending the 25 years experience of living among the Amish from Sarah Price with Pamela Jarrell's extensive 15 years experience interacting and befriending the Amish in Berlin, Ohio, Price and Jarrell team up to give the readers a new type of story that focuses not so much on romance but on friendships and the reality of day-to-day life living among the Amish. Book Three is scheduled to be released January 31, 2014. Preorder it now.
