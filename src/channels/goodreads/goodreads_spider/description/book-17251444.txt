17251444:::::The Mistress:::::The final book in The Original Sinners Series - The Red Years. There's punishment-and then there's vengeance. Nora Sutherlin is being held, bound and naked.

But in Nora's world, no one is ever truly powerless-a cadre of her friends, protectors and lovers stands ready to do anything to save her, even when the only certainty seems to be sacrifice and heartbreak....
