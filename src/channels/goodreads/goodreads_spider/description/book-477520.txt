477520:::::The Life and Campaigns of Stonewall Jackson:::::Stonewall Jackson. His very name evokes the image of the solid, immovable Confederate general whose sobriquet, earned at the Battle of First Manassas, no longer requires quotation marks. In this volume, Stonewall's pious Christian character, service to the church, unwavering commitment to duty, affectionate role as husband and father, as well as his magnificent service to Virginia are carefully recorded by his close friend Robert Lewis Dabney. Labeled by some a religious fanatic, General Jackson was simply a consistent biblical Christian who lived out his faith every day, seriously and without compromise. Dabney's account of military life in the field with General Jackson provides poignant insight into the character of the General as they discuss theology and military history, pray together, and gallop to the sound of the guns. In a day bereft of true heroes, Stonewall's gallant deeds and virtuous conduct still move our hearts with admiration. He shows us how a Christian soldier should live and die.
