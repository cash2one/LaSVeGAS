13243728:::::Revelations:::::When four seemingly ber-cool college kids arrive in a small West Texas town, only one girl recognizes them for who they really are the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Nineteen years old, a greeter at the local Smiley s Supercenter, Kyrie s been blessed with an uncommonly good intuition and a few other abilities she s been keeping secret. Those abilities aren't enough to deal with the Horsemen, though, who bring with them a magnitude of evil Kyrie s never seen before. Adding to the complications, her best friend has gone missing and Nate, her gorgeous but chronically deceptive ex-flame, falls back into her life. That can t be a coincidence, can it? Then there s Aaron, the oldest child in a family considered overly-religious even by Texas standards. He seems determined to help her whether she wants it or not. As plagues descend on the tiny town, Kyrie finds herself facing down Death, Pestilence, Famine and War in a fight for the survival of the small town she calls home. But as myth becomes reality and discoveries are made that shake her to her core, she begins to waver in her conviction of right and wrong. Temptation waits in the dark of stormy Texas nights, and if Kyrie can t find the will to fight any longer, the end of days are only just beginning.
