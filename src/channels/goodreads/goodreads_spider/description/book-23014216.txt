23014216:::::When I Fall:::::From New York Times bestselling author, J. Daniels, comes a sexy new STANDALONE novel. For the past nine years, I ve kept my heart as far away from my dick as possible. Those two can t be anywhere near each other. They don t play nice, and one of them undoubtedly winds up getting hurt. Not my dick. My dick is good. The women I take home know exactly what they re getting from me sex. Nothing more. At least, that s what s supposed to happen. The sweet brunette from Kentucky I set my sights on tonight shouldn t have been any different. I had her right where I wanted her. Where I needed her. But when my past comes walking into McGill s pub, the woman in my arms decides to take things to a whole new level, putting me into a situation I never saw coming. My heart is about to get f**ked. My dick can sit this one out.
