9883317:::::Called to Life:::::How do I find fulfillment in life? How do I obtain happiness? Despite a multitude of self-help books in recent years, these eternal questions have become increasingly urgent in today s directionless world. Author Jacques Philippe provides some answers. In his new book, &lt;i&gt;Called to Life&lt;/i&gt;, he explains that a complete and fulfilled life is much more assured when we stop trying to chart our own course, when we realize that we are essentially creatures called by God. He goes on to describe where and how these calls take place: the events of life, the Word of God in Scripture, and interior motions of the Holy Spirit. Learning to recognize and follow these calls is what leads to a happy and full life. &lt;i&gt;Called to Life&lt;/i&gt; includes a special section on how to read Sacred Scripture prayerfully &lt;b&gt;(Lectio Divina)&lt;/b&gt;.
