432417:::::I'll Steal You Away:::::Italian literary superstar Niccol Ammaniti s debut novel, I m Not Scared, prompted gushing praise, hit international best-seller lists, and was made into a smash indie film. With his highly anticipated follow-up, Ammaniti takes his unparalleled empathy for children, his scythe-sharp observations, and his knack for building tension to a whole new level. In a tiny Italian village, a young boy named Pietro is growing up tormented by bullies and ignored by his parents. When an aging playboy, Graziano Biglia, returns to town, a change is in the air: Pietro decides to take on the bullies, his lonely teacher Flora finds romance with the town s prodigal son, and the inept janitor at the school proclaims his love for his favorite prostitute. But the village isn t ready for such change, and when Graziano seduces and forgets Flora, both she and Pietro s tentative hopes seem crushed forever. With great tenderness, Ammaniti shines light on the heart-wrenching failures and quiet redemptions of ordinary people trying to live extraordinary lives. I ll Steal You Away is a fresh and classic story of a boy learning to be a man that delivers on the promise of Ammaniti s acclaimed debut.
