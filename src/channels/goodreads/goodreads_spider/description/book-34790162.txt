34790162:::::Beggar:::::I was on the streets, until I wasn't. They took me, fed me, clothed me. For a time I was happy, until he came back. I had five years to accept his chains, my monster. He owned me, until I met the Enforcer of The Satan Snipers. His name was Zero. He wasn't just an enforcer. He was a stone blooded killer. Beggar: - I've never known a day of being normal or having a hot plate of food to eat. I don't even know what it feels like to have a bath. The streets of Washington has been my home since the day I was born. As the years went on by, I learnt to survive on these streets, I even learnt to smile. Now meet Zero: - I know I should let it rest, but I can't drop it. I need to know her name. My gut is riding me hard. My instincts are telling me it's important. I'm the enforcer. If there's even a thread that she's a danger to my club I need to know. -When I was younger I was a beggar by circumstance, when I got older I remained a beggar by choice.- Beggar
