456902:::::Butterfly Weed:::::This is the life story of the colorful physician of Harington s acclaimed Stay More novels, Doc Swain: how he becomes a physician without benefit of medical school education, how he winds up as a high-school teacher of hygiene and enamored of a pretty student, how his love for her ultimately leads him to face some heartbreaking choices. Bawdy, rich in language and detail, and very funny.
