15830337:::::Return to Stantasyland:::::Stanley V. Paskavich's second volume of poetry about life, love, religion, reality, inspiration and infinity. Stan's second collection of poetry and the product of six years of work, this return to the mind of its author delves more deeply into the emotional landscape of a witness to the horrors of war. Despite the powerful passages relating military service and the life of a small-town boy, there is much more here than a cursory glance could possibly discern. Whimsical tales, comedic portrayals, explorations of the nature of reality, infinity and God... almost no stone is left unturned and the lyrical beauty makes every discovery a pleasure.
