1350666:::::The Prince of Eden:::::HE WAS THE POWER AND THE FURY OF A DYNASTY. SHE WAS THE LOVE THAT COULD DESTROY HIM Edward Eden, a noble and passionate man of the people pursued a course decreed by his bastard heritage. Heir to the vast wealth but not the title of Lord Thomas Eden's estate, he rose to become the most splendid libertine in all London...and fell into the iron grip of a sinister addiction. Dashing conqueror of hearts, more willing then wise, he drank freely, recklessly from the waters of passion...only to lose himself body and soul to the one woman whose intoxicating thirst he was -- and forbidden -- to quench. Her world was forgotten, his destiny sealed, a dynasty dammed, in one silent hour of love.
