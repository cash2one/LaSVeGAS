946836:::::The Slippery Map:::::If you've ever whiled away an afternoon dreaming of another world, then you know that place is real. Oyster R. Motel has dreamed of another world for almost his whole life. (But that's only understandable he's been raised in a nunnery. Do you think nuns approve of swinging from the belfry? Of raising tadpoles in the holy water? Of playing the organ at all hours? They do not.) Oyster didn't even know that imaginations could be mapped; he barely knew he had an imagination. But then a gust of wind and a distant voice send him on a dizzying ride in a silver bucket, and Oyster finds himself, his own map in hand, in someone else 's imaginary world a place where rivers breathe and sugar snows down from the sky. Whose world is it? And what does it have to do with Oyster's map? You'll have to read the book to find out. Imagine that .
