3699512:::::We Are Quiet, We Are Loud: The Best Young Writers and Artists In America:::::The Best Young Writers and Artists in America, drawn from the 2005, 2006, and 2007 winners of the Scholastic Art and Writing Awards. Chosen from tens of thousands of entries to the Scholastic Art &amp; Writing Awards, PUSH is proud to present the best young writers and artists in America. Some show us the world with quiet force. Others yell. There is anger in these pages, as well as love. There is clarity, as well as confusion. And there is hope. Hope that things can sometimes be fixed. Hope that eventually high school will end, Hope that a new generation of writers can use their quiet and their noise to make an undeniable mark. Listen to what they have to say -- and see what they can do.
