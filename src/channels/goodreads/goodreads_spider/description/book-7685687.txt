7685687:::::The Social Climber of Davenport Heights:::::Ah, the life of the upper-crust: decadent, flaky and not so good for the heart. Jane Lofton has everything she ever dreamed of: a high-powered career, a fabulous home, a wealthy husband, David, and a beautiful daughter, Brynn. Of course, David also has a new girlfriend spending his old money. Brynn also has a therapist helping her articulate her contempt for her mother. And Jane also has an obligation to the Man Upstairs. A chance meeting between her BMW and an eighteen-wheeler prompts Jane to make a deal: let her live and she'll dedicate herself to Doing Good. Whatever that means. Jane's platinum-card kung fu has taught her how to spend, but not how to give turns out it's actually pretty hard! But when her country-club life crumbles, Jane is faced with an even bigger challenge: replacing all her dreams and salvaging her soul. Wise, witty and relentlessly real, The Social Climber of Davenport Heights (Originally published as Doing Good ) is a story about discovering the difference between what something costs and what it's worth.
