809635:::::Circles in the Stream:::::It's every girl's fantasy to find herself pulled into a new magical world-and make a difference to the extraordinary creatures that live there. That's what awaits them in Avalon, a place where magic is real. It begins with winged cats, mighty mistwolves, duck-like quiffles and one pretty amazing golden ferret that are not of this world. Hurt, hungry and barely alive, they have come to be healed, to be helped, to get home - for a last desperate attempt at survival. But the magical animals did not come alone. The evil that stalked them in their world has followed them into ours. It will not stop until it gets what it wants: the secret map to a place called Avalon. The animals' only hope is to fulfill an ancient prophecy and find three very different, but special girls: a healer, a warrior and a blazing star, who can lead them through a web of magical worlds, to the place from which all magic flows, Avalon.
