13095649:::::Werewolves Be Damned:::::Nexi Jones part witch, part guardian, and wannabe kick-ass warrior can t throw a punch or conjure the simplest magic. But that doesn t stop her from hunting the werewolves who slaughtered her human family. She ll have her revenge, but only if Kyden, the elite guardian, would get the hell out of her way. Kyden can t decide if Nexi wants to get herself killed or if she just has no clue what she s doing. But her father made it clear: keep Nexi safe or else. Of course, the more Nexi runs toward revenge, the more she needs Kyden s aid, and as she grows into her power and confidence, so does his desire to protect her. The only problem? She d rather he dropped dead. But when a vampire paints a bull s-eye on Nexi s back, she s hard-pressed to deny Kyden and the help he s offering. Even if it means getting her revenge will be a little bit harder. At least it will still be as sweet. This story was previously published elsewhere under the title The Willow in 2010, and has been revised and expanded for Entangled Publishing .
