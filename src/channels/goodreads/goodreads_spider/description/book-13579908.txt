13579908:::::The Occupation:::::The invasion had ended long ago. Earth was now home to the Shylmahn. The remnants of humanity survived as best they could on Shylmahn-controlled reservations or hidden away in tiny communities out of sight of the masters of the planet. Most humans had never known a world not dominated by the Shylmahn. Most were content to silently live out their lives in the shadows, ever fearful of drawing attention to themselves. The surviving members of the Britton family were not content. These few were the battle-weary veterans of an all-but-forgotten war long since lost. Myths and legends from a distant past, quickly fading into the obscurity of a human history soon to vanish, they now fought a war that no one knew was being waged. Book Two of the Shylmahn Trilogy.
