13127703:::::Marley: The Other Christmas Carol:::::Damned! Marley s soul was lost, doomed to wander among the ranks of humanity, generation after generation, without the powers to be humane. The curse of his chains was a heavy one, and there were many a time in which he found the weight of said chains to be unbearable. So this must be perfectly understood: Marley was without hope. Marley s lot was indeed a sad one. Misery was his meat, and despair was his drink. Nothing of the earth was his except for the cold fingers of the grave. And it was there that Marley would never retreat. The grave was death! Marley had no powers such as those given to other earth-bound spirits. He was a wraith a wanderer. However, upon saving the soul of a dear friend, he was given a haunting. In this haunting, Marley s powers could not be equaled. However, one foot off the haunting s property, and his soul would find itself in endless damnation. Marley found himself trapped, staring out a window, into an ever-changing world. A world he would never again become a part of. A world of love, laughter, sorrow, and pain, he would always be a stranger to. Waiting and waiting. Hoping to prove himself worthy.
