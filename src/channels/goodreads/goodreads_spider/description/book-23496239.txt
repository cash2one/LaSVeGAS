I was never one of those women who was going to be defined by the size of my boobs. But at the thought of losing them to cancer at age twenty-four, suddenly they are front and center. So to speak. So, now I live my life by the numbers. Ninety-three the percent chance I will survive the five-year mark. Thirteen the number of cycles of chemotherapy I must endure.

He single-handedly takes one of the scariest things either of us has ever faced in life and makes it better tolerable dare I even say fun. He s unlike any man I ve ever known. Generous, witty, talented, and smart. He has vision vision that for some inexplicable reason, we seem to share through the paintings of his abstract art. What we share, however, seems to go beyond cancer and art. And we soon come to find we have a connection much deeper than either of us can begin to comprehend.
