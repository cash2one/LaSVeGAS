18964659:::::The Rage Plague:::::In the winter of 2017 visions were seen by Navajo medicine men that what seemed to be the dead would walk for a time, taking peace from the earth. A warning was given to band with other tribes and prepare; the great enemy was coming and would try to hunt down all the peoples of the earth. In the year 2019 the Rage Plague hit and every human on earth was exposed to the virus. Most people got sick as the virus attacked certain lobes of the brain making some people volatile and animal like and others, psychotic blood thirsty lunatics that were hard to kill and cannibalized their victims. These infected peoples were known as Ragers, due to their ballistic tempers and penchant for horrific violence. The enigma of the Rage Plague is that some people got sick and recovered without any damage to the brain and others were completely immune to the virus and just as the Navajo prophesy predicted none of the Southwestern Indian Tribes were infected. This is a story of Rose Williams who is trying to make it to the Navajo Reservation before the plague is totally out of control and John Paul Bluehouse a retired tribal police officer and medicine man trying to lead his people through this dangerous time and secure the reservation. The Rage Plague is an adventure to a land that holds beauty and mystery and of revelation into the human spirit as it is put through the test of incomparable tribulations. It is an experience into mind and soul, of imagery and imagination and a rare look into the Navajo people and customs. This short story is a risk worth taking, so take it and come out gratified!
