5514234:::::Burn:::::It s true what they say: Money changes everything. And in Linda Howard s red-hot novel Burn , the changes come fast, furious, and filled with the kind of sexy suspense, heart-stopping romance, beautiful people, and risky business guaranteed to give you the most bang for your buck. Money certainly changes Jenner Redwine s life when she wins a lottery jackpot. But it also costs her plenty: Her father rips her off and disappears, her fortune-hunting boyfriend soon becomes her ex, and friends-turned-freeloaders give her the cold shoulder when she stops paying for everything. Flush with new money, Jenner can t imagine ever finding a place in the world of the wealthy. Seven years later, though, she s rubbing elbows with the rich, despite the fact she still feels like a party crasher. Luckily she finds an ally -and a guide to the rarefied realm of privilege -in shy, kind-hearted heiress Sydney Hazlett, who quickly becomes Jenner s confidante and surrogate sister. When Sydney invites Jenner on a charity cruise aboard a luxury liner, Jenner reluctantly agrees. But while she s expecting -and dreading -two weeks of masquerade balls, art auctions, and preening glitterati, what she gets is more like a Hitchcock movie than a Love Boat episode. Taken hostage by a menacing stranger, Jenner must cooperate in a mysterious cloak-and-dagger scheme- or else. With nowhere to run, and with Sydney s life as well as her own at risk, Jenner is drawn into a game of dizzying intrigue and harrowing danger. But as her panic gives way to exhilaration, and fear of her captor turns to fascination, Jenner rediscovers feelings she hasn t had in years -and realizes she s found a life worth living. If she survives.
