John Carter, red-blooded American soldier and fortune hunter, embarks on the adventure of a lifetime. He's transported to Mars-a dying planet ruled by violence. As an alien to the red planet and its gravity, Carter is gifted with great strength. His superhuman attributes come in handy-the bloodthirsty green Martians value triumph in battle over all else. Carter fights both red and green Martian warriors, but loses his heart to the jewel of Mars-Dejah Thoris. Dejah Thoris is the granddaughter of the most powerful leader of her planet. She is captured by her enemies and awaits a cruel execution. John Carter is willing to fight to the death to save her. He's handsome, powerful and clearly attracted to her-but the earthling's uncouth manners offend Dejah Thoris' highborn sensibilities. Carter yearns for the beautiful princess, even as she turns a cold cheek to him. With life and death in the balance and their hearts on the line, what will it take for Dejah Thoris of Mars to give herself to John Carter of Earth? And what deliciously exotic surprises await the lovers when their relationship finally deepens...?
