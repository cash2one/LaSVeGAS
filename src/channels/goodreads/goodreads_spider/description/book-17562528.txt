OFW: This is My Life and Story is a story of young man from a small island of Negros Occidental, the Philippines, who treaded his life to a city and found his true love. He never thought that life in Manila (The City of Hopes) is a rugged terrain of heartaches, lies, hatred and revenge. He found his true-self when destiny engulfed him working in a faraway place called Dubai (The City of Dreams) as an OFW. Lied and played his game so well to reach his dreams; used his charms to build corporations and became the first OFW Billionaire in the history of the Philippine Islands! Marco Fernando s new status in life was confronted by a series of discoveries he never imagined. Poverty consumed him to continue his journey until a rich woman Danielle Gustilo shed light playing the game he mastered; she never thought that Marco became her enemy for life. Marco decided to play the dirty game of love without the knowledge of his wife Ayah Isabel Gonzales while reaching his dreams abroad, and a lifetime journey in molding his future. He longed for happy-family-life through his money, but boredom surrounds him that nearly broke his family. OFW: This is My Life and Story was inspired by my spellbinding life story as an OFW in the UAE for 20 years; added by the roller-coaster events, sacrifices, love for family and the unending struggles of OFWs that never been told before.
