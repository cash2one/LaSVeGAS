72481:::::Darker Passions: Dracula:::::Reprint of this sexualized version of the classic. Bram Stoker's Dracula was heavy with the repressed sexuality of the Victorian age; here, the sexual undercurrent surfaces and slinks wryly to the center of the action. Dracula is not the cretinous lurker of Herzog's cinematic Nosferatu: he is a sexy beast, a powerful being who takes pleasure, yes, from drinking blood, and also delights in domination, bondage, spanking, and S/M games. .
