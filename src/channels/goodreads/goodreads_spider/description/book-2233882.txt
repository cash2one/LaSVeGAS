2233882:::::Blood Trail:::::It is elk season in the Rockies, but this year a different kind of hunter is stalking a different kind of prey. When the call comes in on the radio, Joe Pickett can hardly believe his ears: game wardens have found a hunter dead at a camp in the mountains; strung up, gutted, and flayed, as if he were the elk he'd been pursuing. A spent cartridge and a poker chip lie next to his body. Ripples of horror spread through the community, and with a possibly psychotic killer on the loose Governor Rulon is forced to end the hunting season early for the first time in state history. Are the murders the work of a deranged antihunting activist or of a lone psychopath with a personal vendetta? As always, Joe Pickett is the governor's go-to man, and he s put on the case to track the murderous hunter, as more bodies and poker chips turn up. Bold, fast-paced, and with a controversial hook-hunting versus antihunting activists. Blood Trail is proof that C. J. Box is an ever-rising talent.
