25124559:::::That Sugar Book: This book will change the way you think about 'healthy' food:::::In the health documentary That Sugar Film , writer and director Damon Gameau enlists the help of Stephen Fry, Hugh Jackman and leading scientists around the world to shine a light on the terrible effects of sugar. In a Supersize Me -style experiment, he changes his diet to include 40 teaspoons of sugar a day for 60 days - the average daily sugar intake in Australia - and monitors the effect on his body. But here is the catch - he cannot eat chocolate, sweets, ice cream or cake; the sugar must come from 'healthy' foods. In this illustrated That Sugar Book , Damon explains how sugar damages our bodies and our minds, and how easy it is to consume sugar without even knowing it. Revealing the astonishing amounts of sugar hidden in supposedly healthy foods on supermarket shelves - such as low-fat yoghurt, muesli and children's fruit snacks - Damon makes us realise the damage we unknowingly do to ourselves and our families when we make poor food choices, and shows us how to make it right. With an up-close account of Damon's sugar experiment, and sugar-free recipes to help you wean off the white stuff, That Sugar Book is a startling wake-up call to those of us who have never questioned what's really in our food.
