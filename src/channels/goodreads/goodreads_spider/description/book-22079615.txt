22079615:::::The Assistant:::::Don t worry, I won t try anything Even though I want to. Emily Johnson needs this job. What she doesn t need, is all the aggravation that comes with being the assistant of the world s most eligible bachelor. 25-year-old billionaire Adrian Kingston, Emily s boss, is known for being difficult. He works late at night and early in the day and expects his assistant to do the same. The only thing he does for fun is, well, women. The spoiled, wealthy playboy gets whatever he wants from whomever he wants. Some mornings, women swing in and out of his office, one after the other. And as if he couldn t get enough girls, he even tosses his flirtation and sexual innuendo Emily s way. Good thing Emily knows how to keep her priorities straight. A flirty, devastatingly handsome boss? His jealous girlfriends? Her demanding workload? Emily has enough on her plate! She really doesn t need all the headache. What she doesn t understand though, is this: Why does Adrian seem to need her? After all, Emily Johnson, while beautiful, is not exactly Adrian s usual type. What could he possibly want with her? Is this just another game played by a bored, rich billionaire trying to win the only girl who has the guts to tell him No? Or could Adrian Kingston really be falling in love with The Assistant? *A sweet, sexy contemporary romance for new adults.
