836182:::::Tempted Champions:::::Fallen AngelsBuffy's shaken to learn that Celina, the new girl in town, is actually a vamp who's heard of Buffy's rep. She's here to challenge the Slayer and even Angel -- in L.A. -- is concerned that this time, Buffy may be in over her head. Celina's not the only monster skulking about the neighborhood. D'Hoffryn has returned to Sunnydale to offer Anya another chance as a vengeance demon. Can she give up her romance with Xander and the friendships she's forged as a mortal for another shot at immortality -- even if it comes with a horrific price tag? Dawn tries to explain to Anya that humanity is worth the occasional heartache, even as she has doubts of her own. Suddenly Buffy learns the terrifying truth about Celina: she's not just any vamp -- she was once a Slayer herself. Buffy has struggled with her own dark side enough to question the subtle distinction between "Slayer" and killer. If Celina turned Buffy, and Willow restored Buffy's soul, could she possibly find love with Angel at last? And, more importantly, would she still be a hero?
