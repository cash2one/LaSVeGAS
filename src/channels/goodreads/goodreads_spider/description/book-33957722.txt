33957722:::::Forever:::::She s all I could ever want I have a reputation around school. Cold. Untouchable. Unfeeling. Only one girl could ever make me want to change and that s Amanda Winters. Too bad I broke her heart and drove her away. So to get through the rest of my days in high school, I tell myself I need to focus on more important things. Like taking our football team to championships. Get accepted to the college of my choice. And finish my senior year without wanting to run away from my problems. But your problems chase after you no matter where you go. And it s a lot harder when you fight them alone. The longer I go without Amanda, the more I miss her. Her smile. Her laughter. The things she said. How she looked at me like I was the only person who mattered. The way she made me feel Why can t I have everything, including the girl? I m determined to make things right. And make Amanda mine Forever.
