8109709:::::The Evolution of Bruno Littlemore:::::Told from the point of view of the world's first chimpanzee to develop the power of speech, this stunning debut novel chronicles the extraordinary events that lead to his imprisonment for murdering a man... With The Evolution of Bruno Littlemore, Benjamin Hale presents a relentlessly inventive coming of age story that is by turns comic, violent, heartbreaking, and perverse. Talking animals are as old as storytelling, but Bruno's fictional memoir stands apart for its brilliant and striking expression of what it feels like to be human. It is, in the end, a novel about finding one's own voice, and insisting on it.
