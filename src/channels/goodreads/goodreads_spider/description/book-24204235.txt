24204235:::::The Girl I Was Before:::::I m the selfish one. I suppose that s the nicest thing people say about me. I ve heard the other things, too. Paige Owens is a pretty girl with nothing else to offer. She s just a good time at a party. She s stupid, heartless, cold and useless. All she cares about is getting a guy to look at her. Why would anyone want to be her friend? Some of those things are true. Others were true. They re all hurtful. None of it matters. I m ready to make the hard choices. I m ready to face the consequences. I m ready to be the girl I was before, and I m done being the one who lost her way. I m ready to become the girl Houston Orr sees when he looks at me. Houston isn t a star athlete. He doesn t play in a band. He s never going to be president, and his life is so far away from simple and easy it isn t even funny. He wasn t part of my plan. But I m starting to think plans are overrated, and maybe our stories are what we make them. And mine depends entirely on me, and the choices I make starting now. Houston is my fairytale. He s perfectly imperfect. He s poetry and life. He s truth and heartbreak, all rolled up in a tall body with dark hair, broad shoulders and green eyes that lull me into submission. He s nothing I ever thought I wanted, but the very thing I need. He s the only guy I ve ever really loved, and he thinks I m a princess. I fell into him, and now I m holding on. But sometimes life takes away our ability to choose. Sometimes things aren t in your control. Sometimes, it hurts to be selfless. My only hope is that when it comes time to choose, I get it right. Welcome to my once upon a time and wish for happily ever after.
