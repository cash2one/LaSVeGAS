6286319:::::Sapphire Dream:::::A bit of magic, a twist of fate, and a prophecy of danger and desire... Brenna Cameron came to Castle Stour on the coast of Scotland seeking answers about her past. All she has is the sapphire pendant around her neck and a vague feeling that she has seen this place before. She never imagined that she would be transported to a seventeenth-century pirate ship, complete with a dangerous crew of scallywags and a handsome captain who is none too pleased to have her aboard. Rourke Douglas knows the appearance of this beautiful stranger is linked to the prophecy that has haunted his family for years. When the fiery-haired siren materializes on his ship, courtesy of the mythical sapphire and a bit of meddling magic, Rourke wants nothing more than to send her back to wherever she came from. But something about Brenna stirs his wounded soul, and Rourke knows he cannot outrun his destiny any longer.
