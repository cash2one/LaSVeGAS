8147:::::The Gift:::::The Gift is the last of the novels Nabokov wrote in his native Russian and the crowning achievement of that period in his literary career. It is also his ode to Russian literature, evoking the works of Pushkin, Gogol, and others in the course of its narrative: the story of Fyodor Godunov-Cherdyntsev, an impoverished migr poet living in Berlin, who dreams of the book he will someday write--a book very much like The Gift itself.
