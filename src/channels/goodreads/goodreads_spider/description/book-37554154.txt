37554154:::::Poems from a Runaway:::::Welcome to Ben Westwood's collection of 60 true-story poems - Poems from a runaway . It s his story of being a teenager in care, and a frequent runaway from the west midlands (UK). Follow him on a journey from ten years old, wandering from town to town before eventually at the age of twelve, finding himself in the east end of London with drug addicts and prostitutes. A year later he was to be sleeping rough in London s West end, meeting celebrities and all sorts of folk. It s a story with many tragedies, but also comedic moments. Choices that would have only been made with a youngsters thinking, and angels along the way. Predators, friends, heart-warming times and dangerous moments. Hustles, wind-ups and the way young people entertain themselves along the way. Some moments in life that some may never had knew existed.
