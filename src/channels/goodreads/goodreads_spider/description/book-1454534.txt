1454534:::::The Every Boy:::::In this addictive and highly original debut novel a fifteen-year-old boy dies mysteriously, leaving behind a secret ledger filled with his darkly comic confessions. Whether fantasizing about being a minority, breaking into his neighbors homes, or gunning down an exotic bird, Henry Every s wayward quest for betterment sometimes bordered on the criminal. Alone now in their suburban house, his father pores over the ledger in a final attempt to connect with the boy he never really knew -- and, more urgently, to figure out how he died. As Harlan Every learns the truth about his son s many misadventures and transgressions, he also discovers the part he unwittingly played in Henry s tragic death and the real reason his wife walked out years ago. The story grows into two parallel love stories -- one past, one present -- with drastically different outcomes. Witty and wise, The Every Boy is a page-turning mystery, a love story, an exploration of what it means to be a family, and a one-of-a kind celebration of human individuality.
