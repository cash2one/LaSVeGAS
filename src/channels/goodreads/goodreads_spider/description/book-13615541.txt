13615541:::::The Hunter and The Hunted:::::In Off-Duty Angel (Otherworld #10.6), dark witch and half-demon Eve Levine is desperate for a little entertainment while her lover, Kristof Nast , is detained in afterlife court enough to volunteer an extra week s worth of angel corps duty just to pass the time. Luckily something even better comes up: a real celestial bounty-hunter mission to trail a shaman, someone who might prove to be a useful lead in Kristof s court case. Following the target goes smoothly, until he leads Eve to the British Museum, where she inadvertently steps into a secret dimensional passage and stumbles upon a far more enticing puzzle . . . and a much greater danger. This collection also includes Stalked (Otherworld #7.3), previously printed in My Big Fat Supernatural Honeymoon . It s not a good sign when Elena Michaels and Clayton Danvers resort to everyday activities on their long-awaited honeymoon in St. Louis. But their encroaching boredom is about to take a backseat to an unexpected threat that catches Clay s attention. A non-pack werewolf is clearly stalking them out to claim Elena for himself and Clay has no intention of letting the upstart mutt spoil their romantic getaway, even if that means deceiving Elena as he pursues the rival werewolf on his own. Includes an exclusive early look at the first seven chapters of Thirteen , the Otherworld series finale coming July 24, 2012 .
