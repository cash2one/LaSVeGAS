10928584:::::Stephen:::::THE HEART OF THE PEOPLE In the deep woods, there dwelt a small band of nomads known as the Peacemakers. They were a quiet people who trusted in the goodness of the Father of Spirits and lived from the fruit of the ground. Because they lived in such close communion with the land, the Peacemakers were a humble people, holding gentleness in high esteem. They were a people made up of many tribes of the old country that had been brought together by the Great Hand of Mercy. In the early days, there were many peoples scattered over the old lands of Ability. Ability lay east of the Triall and was an ever-present reminder to the Peacemakers of the land they were now exiled from. The river was, for the most part, feared by many who wandered in the wilderness; for, it was the great river that had separated them from their homeland. The river was believed to be the curse that kept them estranged from their heritage, thereby keeping them besieged by the evil ways of the Horsemen. Yet, it was this same river which forced them to seek every means possible to live peaceably together. Hence, their namesake. Stephen is a fictional story about a Nomadic Tribe. Based on biblical principals, 'Stephen' teaches life lessons to yearning hearts. Gary Zackery, who authored the book, is pleased to welcome John Borgstedt as co-author.
