My sister Camille is a wicked good witch with three gorgeous husbands. Delilah is a two-faced werecat and a Death Maiden. And me? I m Menolly, a vampire married to a scorching hot werepuma. And right now, we re facing enemies on all sides It s been a long and devastating week. Back in Otherworld, war has decimated the elfin city of Elqaneve, our father has gone missing, and Shadow Wing has managed to obtain another spirit seal. On the home front, somebody burned down my bar, the Wayfarer, killing eight people, including a friend. To make matters worse, we still haven t found a way to stop Lowestar Radcliff the daemon in charge of a supernatural corporate power grab. He s attempting to awaken Suvika, the lord of vice and corrupt businessmen, and we have to stop him. Our enemies are closing in on all sides, and this time, there s no place to hide
