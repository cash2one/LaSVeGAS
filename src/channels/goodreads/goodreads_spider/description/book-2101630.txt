2101630:::::Bridle Path:::::When Max, the manager at Pine Hollow Stables, asks for The Saddle Club's help in sorting through some old riding costumes, Lisa, Carole, and Stevie quickly agree. In exchange for their help, Max has promised to get them tickets to the Capitol Horse Show in Washington, D.C., where the girls will get to see their old friend Dorothy DeSoto and her fiance, Nigel. At first, going through some old clothes doesn't seem like much fun, but then The Saddle Club comes up with a great idea: They'll use the old clothes to stage a wedding for Pine Hollow's handsome new stallion. And what better wedding date than the first of April...better known as April Fool's Day!
