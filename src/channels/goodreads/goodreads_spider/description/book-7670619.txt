At the heart of the hall, a great metal dragon oozes gold. Then the Herald appears, demanding the return of her treasure.... And next come the gunships. The battle for possession of the treasure has begun, and only the Doctor and his friends can save the people of the city from being destroyed in the crosfire of an ancient civil war.
