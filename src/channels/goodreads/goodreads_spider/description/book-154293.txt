An international conglomerate? All are networks, and all are a part of a surprising scientific revolution. Albert-L szl Barab si, the nation s foremost expert in the new science of networks and author of Bursts , takes us on an intellectual adventure to prove that social networks, corporations, and living organisms are more similar than previously thought. Grasping a full understanding of network science will someday allow us to design blue-chip businesses, stop the outbreak of deadly diseases, and influence the exchange of ideas and information. Just as James Gleick and the Erdos R nyi model brought the discovery of chaos theory to the general public, Linked tells the story of the true science of the future and of experiments in statistical mechanics on the internet, all vital parts of what would eventually be called the Barab si Albert model.
