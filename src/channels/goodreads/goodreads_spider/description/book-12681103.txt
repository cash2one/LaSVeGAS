12681103:::::Laugh with the Moon:::::Laugh with the Moon is on the Texas Bluebonnet Award Master List. Thirteen-year-old Clare Silver is stuck. Stuck in denial about her mother s recent death. Stuck in the African jungle for sixty-four days without phone reception. Stuck with her father, a doctor who seems able to heal everyone but Clare. Clare feels like a fish out of water at Mzanga Full Primary School, where she must learn a new language. Soon, though, she becomes immersed in her new surroundings and impressed with her fellow students, who are crowded into a tiny space, working on the floor among roosters and centipedes. When Clare s new friends take her on an outing to see the country, the trip goes horribly wrong, and Clare must face another heartbreak head-on. Only an orphan named Memory, who knows about love and loss, can teach Clare how to laugh with the moon. Told from an American girl s perspective, this story about how death teaches us to live and how love endures through our memories will capture the hearts of readers everywhere.
