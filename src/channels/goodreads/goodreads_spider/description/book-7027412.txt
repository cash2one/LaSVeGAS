7027412:::::Those Small Lil' Things In Life And Love:::::Have you ever known a guy who would gift his girlfriend soap? Well, say hello to Raj, a young architect, who is a huge film buff and believes that life, is full of filmy angles . He hates his job and has an almost evil boss. He has a shoddy love life, is heart broken and feels that he is the loneliest person on the face of this earth. It s a story connecting all those small little incidents in one s life that one never forgets. It s a journey through growing up. A journey from love, to out of it. Through joy, sadness and anger. About childhood friendship blooming into love. About the one you love not loving you back. About friends making each other happy, and about friends making each other sad about friends fighting. It s about being completely sure about things, and at the same time, being utterly unsure about them. It s about school, college and professional life. It s a lot about the heart, and its desires. It s a story about finding it tough to adjust at times, and then missing it later when they are over.
