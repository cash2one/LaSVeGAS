11529182:::::What the Torah Teaches Us about Spirituality: Through Isaac's Own Spiritual Journey:::::Spirituality is the realization there is a unifying reality. Those among us who are seekers of G-d know we all have the ability to connect to G-d, to each other, and to nature. Can we be spiritual in every aspect of our lives? Our forefather Isaac exemplifies how G-d wants us to incorporate spirituality in our everyday lives. There is only one G-d, and Adonai is the G-d of everything. All of us have the same G-d. When we all come to fully understand what this means, the world will be a better place. Isaac has so much to teach us about the spiritual depths of his story in the Torah. While at first glance the Torah seems to tell us very little about Isaac, first impressions can indeed be very deceiving. After reading about Isaac's own spiritual journey, your soul will be uplifted!
