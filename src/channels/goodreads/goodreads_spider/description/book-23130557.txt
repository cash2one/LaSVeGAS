23130557:::::Bigger Than the Sky:::::Five years ago, I left my fianc , hotter than hot Navy SEAL Kade Kelly, at the altar. No, I m not an idiot. Yes, I had my reasons. Now I ve made a new life for myself working at a large firm in Richmond and I ve left the past behind. Or so I thought. Upon returning to my hometown of Serenity Point, Virginia, to take care of some business, I find that Kade s now home for good and he s none too happy about my being here. Two months. That s all I m staying then I m out of here. Unless I believe the town s pink-haired psychic s prediction. Or embrace the sense of belonging I feel at being back home. Or give in to the emotions stirring inside when Kade's attention is suddenly on me. He scares the crap out of me. He thrills me. He used to tell me our love was bigger than the sky. I always knew ours was a once-in-a-lifetime love. So how can he be so sure it can happen again?
