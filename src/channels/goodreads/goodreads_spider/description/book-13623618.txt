13623618:::::Just Married, Please Excuse:::::Caution! Marriage Ahead- Yashodhara, a quick-tempered gal from the big city is hitched to Vijay, a laidback desi boy from a small town in one word - Trouble! The young couple must learn to adjust to married life and to each other whether it is Yashodhara's 'temper tantrums' or Vijay's foot-in-mouth syndrome with a little help from their idiosyncratic staff, Zarreena and Vinod, their nutty friend Vivi and, of course, their respective families. With the unexpected arrival of baby Anoushka a.k.a. Peanut, the battles escalate, fuelled by their vastly divergent views on raising a child. Will their many differences so endearing at the start of their romance actually turn out to mean that they are just incompatible? Will they ever manage to agree on anything? Or have they just bitten off more than they can chew? A fresh and honest take on marriage and parenthood, and all the chaos that comes with it. This is a story of self-discovery that will have you laughing out loud and sympathizing wholeheartedly with its quirky and likeable cast of characters.
