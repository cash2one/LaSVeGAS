256314:::::Not On Our Watch: The Mission to End Genocide in Darfur and Beyond:::::In this powerful call to action, Oscar-nominated film star Don Cheadle and human rights advocate John Prendergast shine an unsparing spotlight on the genocide in Darfur -- a targeted ethnic extermination chillingly described as "Rwanda in slow motion." The authors explore the roots of the current crisis, recount the stories of their separate and combined involvements, and suggest practical strategies every American can implement to end the death and destruction in Darfur and prevent the next attempted genocide. Transcending the bounds of memoir or history, Not on Our Watch is nothing short of a field guide to citizen activism. Its practical strategies for effecting grassroots change could easily be adopted to serve other worthy causes. [An introduction by U.S. Senators Barack Obama and Sam Brownback offers a political perspective.]
