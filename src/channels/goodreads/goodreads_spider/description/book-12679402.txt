12679402:::::The Messenger:::::Sixteen year old Jeilin leaves the ordinary behind when she's inducted into the king's service as a horseback riding messenger. She expects a life of adventure and freedom, but those hopes are shattered after being captured by a foreign army. Given the choice between death and conversion, she swears service to the enemy even though, in her heart, she remains loyal to her kingdom. As Jeilin's youthful innocence crumbles, she wonders if the prince will still be fond of her; if she can even find a way to help place him back on his rightful throne. Full of turmoil and sacrifice, The Messenger is a powerful tale of survival, bravery, and loyalty.
