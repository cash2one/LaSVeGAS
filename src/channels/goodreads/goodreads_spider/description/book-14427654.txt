14427654:::::Regulated for Murder:::::For ten years, an execution hid murder. Then Michael Stoddard came to town. Bearing a dispatch from his commander in coastal Wilmington, North Carolina, redcoat Lieutenant Michael Stoddard arrives in Hillsborough in February 1781 in civilian garb. He expects to hand a letter to a courier working for Lord Cornwallis, then ride back to Wilmington the next day. Instead, Michael is greeted by the courier's freshly murdered corpse, a chilling trail of clues leading back to an execution ten years earlier, and a sheriff with a fondness for framing innocents-and plans to deliver Michael up to his nemesis, a psychopathic British officer.
