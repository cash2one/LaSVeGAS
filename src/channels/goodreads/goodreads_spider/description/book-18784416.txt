18784416:::::Therapy from the Quran and Hadith:::::The re-emergence of Islamically - centred therapy has increased over the past few decades. This has been motivated by the need for a therapeutic approach to treating mental illness that is ideologically acceptable within the boundaries of Shari'ah. This has become a concern not only for Muslim therapists and their patients but in fact for all Muslims, as part of their adherence to Islam and towards improving their Iman. Muslim psychologists around the world are working hard at developing faith -based models of therapy that are acceptable to their peers and Muslim scholars alike. This book is precisely that; An easy-to-use collection of Qur'anic ayaat and authentic ahadith and their interpretations, that allow bi idh nillah individuals to challenge distressing psychological thoughts and behaviors. Written by an experienced clinical psychologist, the text may be used as a therapeutic aid or reference for clinicians or simply as a general guide to character development. The use of analogy means that the book is relevant to both Muslims and non-Muslims alike with the aim of using guidance from Islam to alleviate difficulties and to improve our understanding of human distress. Only the Creator best knows the creation.
