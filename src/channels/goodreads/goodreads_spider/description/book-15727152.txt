15727152:::::Stealing Atlanta:::::Brandyn Wood is conflicted. He follows the rules as an airline captain, then breaks all the rules to reach his dream of total freedom living on Freeland with his co-conspirators: Smooth--the legendary con man, Summer--the sexy, brilliant PhD, Misty--the ex-Navy Seal, Crackhead--the master machine wizard, Valeri--the glam-uber-fence, and her friends in the Russian Mafiya. The band of thieves decide to go for the big score, the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta. Their mark is the Portend Ulysses Buford--the Federal Reserve Chairman. The con begins at the High Museum and continues through the Fox Theatre, Centennial Park, Atlanta International Airport, CNN, Goth and Fetish clubs. After the successful crime, Brandon is resurrected from the dead and reunited with his love Mai Frennd. The dream is complete. Life is good. It's good to be King!
