1223460:::::Let the Church Say Amen:::::Reverend Simon Jackson has always felt destined to lead, and he's done a good job of it -- having transformed his small Houston church into one of the most respected and renowned in the region. But while the good Reverend's been busy tending his flock, his family's gone astray. His nineteen-year-old daughter, Rachel, gives new meaning to "baby mama drama." David, the oldest at twenty-seven, has been spiraling into a life of crime ever since his promising football career came to an end. Blessedly, Jonathan, Simon's beloved middle child, is in control of his life and is poised to take his side as associate pastor -- or so everybody thinks. At the heart of the Jackson family is Loretta, the Reverend's wife. She has always been devoted to her husband, but she's beginning to realize that enabling him to give more to the church than to their children was her biggest mistake. As things continue to fall apart and secrets are revealed, will Loretta be able to help her husband reunite their tattered family...before it's too late?
