This is the second electrocution murder Lindsay Boxer has come across and the message left in graffiti on the wall at the scene of the crime is the same: NOBODY CARES ANYMORE. What does it refer to? THE 5TH HORSEMAN When Yuki's mother Keiko has a stroke, Lindsay learns of a huge malpractice suit against the San Francisco Medical Center. In the last few years, dozens of patients who were admitted to the emergency room seemed to recover and then died suspicious deaths. Is Yuki's mother safe? In a place where the lives of patients are quite literally in others hands, will Lindsay and her friends be able to establish who they can trust? THE 6TH TARGET After a dramatic shoot out at a ferry dock, Detective Lindsay Boxer is called to the scene to find that three people have been killed, and one of her closest friends, Claire, has been shot and lies bleeding, whilst the murderer is on the run. But mystery and confusion increase when she learns that children are being abducted and that a series of suspicious and unexplained deaths have taken place in the building where Cindy lives. Can she keep the rest of the Women's Murder Club safe and find the missing children in time?
