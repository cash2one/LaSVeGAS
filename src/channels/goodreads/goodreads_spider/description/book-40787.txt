40787:::::Old Turtle And The Broken Truth:::::Seekers of all ages have been inspired by the stirring message of Old Turtle , the beloved, award-winning wisdom tale of peace. Now Old Turtle returns in a timeless story about love, acceptance, and the nature of truth. Long ago, as truth descended onto earth, it split in two: one piece landing among the people and the other blazing through the sky. When the people discover the piece of truth, it gives them strength and happiness. But over time, it turns them arrogant and greedy. They do not share their truth with others, wars rage on, and the earth begins to suffer. Then a Little Girl eager for change journeys to find Old Turtle, seeking the precious piece of wisdom that will mend the people's broken truth, making it -- and them -- whole once again. Douglas Wood's stirring and eloquent fable, soulfully illustrated in luminous watercolor by Jon J Muth, offers readers of all ages inspiration, hope, and a healing vision of peace.
