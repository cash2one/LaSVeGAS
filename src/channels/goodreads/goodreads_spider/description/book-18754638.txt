18754638:::::North Pole Reform School:::::Mistletoe Bell hates Christmas. So would you if you had a name like hers. Her Christmas-mad parents make the festive season last all year, and with another Christmas looming, Mis doesn t think she can take any more. After her carelessness causes an accident at school, it seems like things can t get any worse. Then she wakes up to find The Ghost of Christmases Ruined in her bedroom. She is taken to the North Pole, to a reform school run by elves determined to make her love Christmas. Stuck in a misfit group of fellow Christmas-haters with a motley crew of the weird and even weirder, watched over by elves day and night, she doesn t expect to meet cute and funny Luke, who is hiding a vulnerable side beneath his sarcastic exterior. She doesn t expect to fall in love with him. But all is not as it should be at the North Pole. A certain Mr Claus is making the elves lives a misery, and pretty soon Mistletoe and Luke are doing more than just learning to like Christmas. A YA romantic comedy in which Santa is the bad guy, teaching reindeer to fly is on the curriculum, and zombies have a fondness for Christmas music. Suitable for older teens and upwards due to bad language.
