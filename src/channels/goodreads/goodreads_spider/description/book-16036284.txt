16036284:::::Highlander Unchained:::::The infamous warrior Cree is paraded before the village Dowell and though shackled and wounded he walks with arrogant pride, meeting all the curious and fearful stares of the villagers with a fierceness that has them quickly turning their heads away... all but one woman. Dawn cannot keep her eyes off the captured warrior, though tales of his exploits suggests he s more devil than man. When his eyes meet hers, she wonders if the notorious tales are true for only the devil himself could be that sinfully handsome. Dawn is summoned by the liege lord Colum and ordered to tend Cree, in all ways possible, while he awaits his fate, and please him she must or suffer the consequences. Colum laughs when he issues his orders. He s sending not only a plain woman to please the mighty warrior in his final days, but one he ll find no pleasure with. After all what man wants a woman who cannot utter a sound? But no shackles can hold Cree and when he breaks free he returns to claim the voiceless woman who found a way into his silent heart.
