120694:::::Nutshell Library:::::From Maurice Sendak, the Caldecott Medal-winning genius who created Where the Wild Things Are, comes Nutshell Library , which will enchant readers with four classic titles. Containing pocket-size versions of perennial favorites Alligators All Around , Chicken Soup with Rice , One Was Johnny , and Pierre , this pint-size library is perfect for small hands. Learn the alphabet with silly alligators, drink chicken soup with rice every month, count visitors with a boy named Johnny, and survive a scare with a boy who doesn t care. Endless adventures await in these lyrical stories that children, and their grown-up readers, will love reading and sharing over and over again. A wonderful stocking stuffer or baby shower gift, Maurice Sendak's Nutshell Library will evoke powerful memories for many, and the rhymes and stories continue to speak to new generations of little ones. And if you prefer your Nutshell Library books on their own and not quite so tiny, each is also now available in a board book edition.
