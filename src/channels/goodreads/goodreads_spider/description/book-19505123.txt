19505123:::::Him and Me:::::Kayla Johnson has lived a good high school life. She is relatively liked by everyone, and she tries to be nice and civil to everyone in return. Besides with Tyler Simmons, Kayla has never found true friendship though. When a certain green-eyed boy ruffled her feathers the first day he set foot on her school, the ice princess inside her surfaced. Colby Mariano is an arrogant, full-of-himself badass. That's what Kayla thought. Then they had to spend a considerable amount of time together, much to Kayla's dismay. What she didn't realize was Colby Mariano might be a person who can offer genuine friendship, maybe even more.
