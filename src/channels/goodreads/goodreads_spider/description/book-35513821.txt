35513821:::::Forever Violet:::::A full-length, paranormal romance novel. For the last decade, eighteen-year-old Laikyn has lived in the Common Realm with humans, believing she was human. She can t remember her life before she was eight-years-old, but what she does know is she fears the paranormal creatures from the other realms, particularly werewolves. And for a good reason. A year ago, Laikyn was attacked by two werewolves. She survived only because Legend, a banished vampire, saved her. The scars left behind from the attack haven t healed yet, and neither has her fear of werewolves. So when Legend decides to take her on a trip to the Midnight Realm, where night creatures like werewolves roam free, she s more than nervous, but agrees to go. The moment Laikyn meets Jules, the tortured, gothic werewolf prince of the Violet Mountain pack, she feels a spark of desire almost instantly. She wants nothing more than to take away his pain, but refuses to act on her feelings. She soon discovers the spark is more than just an attraction. That Jules is connected to her past and that she s the very creature she fears and hates. Having no other choice, she stays in the Midnight Realm so Jules can help her rediscover her werewolf roots and figure out why she can t remember her past. But unlike Jules, not every werewolf wants Laikyn to remember. And she may be in danger from werewolves again. Suggested reading age 18+
