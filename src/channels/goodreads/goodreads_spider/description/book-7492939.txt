7492939:::::Amethyst Destiny:::::For two hearts destined to meet, the only passage is a journey through time... Julia Brodie cannot understand why her Scottish cousin gave her a necklace, then insisted she not touch it until she got back to New York until she tries on the beautiful purple garnet outside the Glasgow airport and wakes up in seventeenth-century Scotland. Rescued by Talon, a charming Scottish rogue with an uncanny ability to make her pulse race, she learns that magic has called her through time to perform a task. Known as the Wizard, Talon MacClure can find anything thanks to a powerful amethyst ring a jewel essential to his survival and one he must protect at all cost. But when the amethyst delivers him Julia, then sends them on a perilous mission that puts her in mortal danger, he begins to suspect he will risk everything for love...the greatest magic of all.
