196337:::::Damascus Gate:::::On the cusp of the millennium, Jerusalem has become a battleground in the race for redemption. American journalist Christopher Lucas is investigating religious fanatics when he discovers a plot to bomb the sacred Temple Mount. A violent confrontation in the Gaza Strip, a race through riot-filled streets, a cat-and-mouse game in an underground maze as Lucas follows his leads, he uncovers an attempt to seize political advantage that reveals duplicity and depravity on all sides of Jerusalem s sacred struggle. Ambitious, passionate, darkly comic, Damascus Gate is not only Robert Stone s biggest and best novel to date, but a timely and brilliant story of belief, power, salvation, and apocalypse.
