437586:::::Aristotle: Selections:::::A tour de force of scholarship and the art of translation, this volume includes a fully integrated set of translations by a single team, a feature enabling Greekless readers to read widely and deeply in Aristotle with continuity, appreciation for his use of technical terminology and for the structure of his philosophy as a whole. Building on this advantage is the most detailed glossary in any student edition, one which offers unparalleled definition and explication of Aristotle's terminology and makes clear the correspondence between Greek terms and their renderings. The editors' extensive notes, also co-ordinated with the glossary, suggest alternative translations of problematic passages, discuss Aristotles argument, and elucidate difficult passages.
