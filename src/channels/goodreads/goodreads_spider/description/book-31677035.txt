31677035:::::Meditations on the line of harmony:::::MEDITATIONS ON THE LINE OF HARMONY IS A MAGICAL MERGING OF A LOVE STORY, HEART-RENDING CASES, PERSONAL TRANSFORMATION, SPIRITUAL WISDOM, SWIRLING BROADSWORDS, AND A PRAYER FOR THE PLANET. Pragmatic psychologist Tucker McCoy has filled her post-divorce life in New Mexico with a successful child abuse practice, martial arts training, friends, and colleagues. When a meditation class at her dojo triggers a series of intense visions, she becomes enmeshed in a whirlwind of mystical mysticetes, messenger hawks, visitors from other dimensions, jumps into other people s heads, and prophesies of destruction. Tucker seeks a line of harmony which will balance her insight and intellect, love and independence, personal path and planetary well-being. Frances Steinberg, author, psychologist, martial artist, acupuncturist, interactive learning designer lives in New Zealand at the edge of a farm with her husband and dog. She would probably get more writing done if she didn t have a view of the entrancing Tasman Sea out one window of her office and the glorious Mt Taranaki volcano out the other.
