694270:::::Green River Rising:::::On the day Dr. Ray Klein wins his parole, the disciplinary perfection of Green River Penitentiary in Texas is torn apart by riot - more a tribal war - of unimaginable ferocity. As the inmates take over, the River sucks all inside further toward the abyss. Klein must choose. He must either claim his freedom and abandon his friends and the woman he loves to die, or he must risk all and fight. "Green River Rising" is a thriller that grabs you at the outset and imprisons you in the iron grip of its headlong plot until the final page. It is also an intelligent, literate, philosophical novel about choice, courage, and love - the dark, violent, sexy story of one man's moral choices in the amoral maelstrom.
