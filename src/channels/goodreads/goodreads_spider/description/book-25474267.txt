25474267:::::The Gifting:::::"If science is right, then I am crazy. And crazy is dangerous." In a world where nothing supernatural exists, Tess Eckhart is positive she s going crazy. After her complete freakout at a high school party, her parents worry she might be right. So much that they pack their bags and move across the country, next to a nationally-renowned facility for the mentally ill. Tess is determined to fit in at her new school, despite the whispers and stares. But when it comes to Luka Williams, a reluctantly popular boy in her class, she s unused to a stare that intense. Then the headaches start, and the seemingly prophetic dreams that haunt her at night. As Tess tries harder to hide them, she becomes increasingly convinced that Luka knows something that he might somehow be responsible. But what if she s wrong? What if Luka Williams is the only thing separating her from a madness too terrifying to fathom?
