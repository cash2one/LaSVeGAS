759914:::::The Book of Disquiet:::::The Book of Disquiet is the autobiography of Bernardo Soares, whom Pessoa described as a 'semiheteronym' because "his personality is not different from mine, rather a simple mutilation of it." But Soares never completed his book; it was discovered after Pessoa's death, on disordered scraps of paper in a trunk. Nearly fifty years later, The Book of Disquiet was finally published, but because any edition or translation of this work must choose a sequence for its entries, each presents a substantially different text. Alfred Mac Adam's translation has been widely reviewed as the most accurate and vivid in English.
