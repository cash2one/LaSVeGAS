When a big plan of the universe eludes us, we should try to understand who we are. Odes is a magical story about creating meaning in life. We travel in time and space, and learn together with great minds. Magnificent truths are clothed with a bit of a purple abstraction. Color is mixed with emotion, shape is mixed with the invisible. Big things are shown in a simple way. It is a play of imagination. The universe in Odes is remarkably colorful. It all takes place in the magical kingdom of Odes. Benjamin, the Learner, travels throughout the universe to change himself and the hearts of others. He has to prove his courage to understand great truths in abstract and mysterious ways. He meets giants and sorcerers, fairies and monks. He needs to realize what truly matters in life.
