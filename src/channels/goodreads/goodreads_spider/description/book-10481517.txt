10481517:::::King James Version of the Holy Bible:::::This NOOK edition of the King James Version of the Holy Bible contains both the Old and New Testaments. You can easily navigate to each book by using the NOOK touchscreen or links in the text. At the beginning of each book are additional links to groups of chapters. You can also easily search for book and chapter by using the abbreviated form of the book name.
