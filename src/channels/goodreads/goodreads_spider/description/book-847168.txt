847168:::::A View from the Bridge: A Play in Two Acts:::::America's greatest playwright weaves "a vivid, crackling, idiomatic psychosexual horror tale." Frank Rich, The New York Times In A View from the Bridge Arthur Miller explores the intersection between one man's self-delusion and the brutal trajectory of fate. Eddie Carbone is a Brooklyn longshoreman, a hard-working man whose life has been soothingly predictable. He hasn't counted on the arrival of two of his wife's relatives, illegal immigrants from Italy; nor has he recognized his true feelings for his beautiful niece, Catherine. And in due course, what Eddie doesn't know about her, about life, about his own heart will have devastating consequences. "The play has moments of intense power. . . . Miller plays on the audience with the skill of a master." Clive Barnes, New York Post
