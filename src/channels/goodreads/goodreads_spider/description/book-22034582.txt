22034582:::::The Shopping Swap:::::Maggie Andrew has a problem. She needs to convince Richard, her attorney boyfriend of five years, that he s finally ready for a commitment. How? By planning an unforgettable night starting with a romantic dinner for two and ending in the bedroom. And to help things along, Maggie has spent half of her salary on sexy black lingerie from Crandall s Department Store that Richard won t be able to resist. Except, once home, Maggie realizes she has someone else s shopping bag and instead of her very expensive lingerie, she s stuck with a housecoat that wouldn t turn anyone s head, least of all Richard's. When Maggie goes back to the scene of the swap, she runs into Benjamin Saunders, a tall, dark and handsome stranger, who not only has what she wants but may also turn out to have what she needs. Suddenly what Maggie thinks she has with Richard is called into question and she s not sure of anything.
