250825:::::Race Matters:::::In this essay collection, many of which have previously appeared in journals, West, the director of Afro-American studies at Princeton &amp; author of several books, addresses a number of issues of concern to black Americans: the LA riots after the Rodney King verdict; Malcolm X; Clarence Thomas &amp; Anita Hill; &amp; black street life. These topics are all timely yet timeless in that they represent the continuing struggle to include African Americans in mainstream American political, economic &amp; social life without destroying their unique culture. The essays have the feel of a fine sermon, with thought-provoking ideas &amp; new ways of looking at the same old problems. They can be quickly read yet take a long time to digest because of West's unique slant on life. Already well known in scholarly circles, he's increasingly becoming more visible to the general public. This book should make his essays more accessible to a greater number of people.-- Library Journal Preface Introduction: Race matters Nihilism in Black America The pitfalls of racial reasoning The crisis of Black leadership Demystifying the new Black conservatism Beyond affirmative action: equality and identity On Black-Jewish relations Black sexuality: the taboo subject Malcolm X and Black rage Epilogue to the Vintage edition
