15716466:::::Building Character:::::Fen Marshal believes in living her life exactly as she pleases. She's a writer and a womanizer who has her fun and walks away before anyone has a chance to want more from her. It's not part of her plan to fall victim to obsessive lust, and as for love, well that just never enters the equation. But Ruby is the woman is the woman of Fen's dreams - literally. Fen finds herself attracted and obsessed - besotted - with a particularly delicious character from one of her own noir fiction novels. It's an obsession that brings Ruby to life - somehow, who cares how? Fen doesn't. Fen just wants to love this creature she's manifested through the pure strength of her imagination. There's only one problem. Ruby is not a nice character. Yes, she's beautiful. But she's also ruthless, possesses no heart or soul and doesn't bleed. She may just be the worst mistake Fen's ever made.
