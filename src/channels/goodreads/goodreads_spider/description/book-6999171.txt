6999171:::::No Place to Call Home, the Memories of a Polish Survivor of the Soviet Gulag:::::No Place to Call Home relates the experiences of a 19-year-old Pole who is captured by the Soviets at the beginning of World War II and sent to a Siberian concentration camp in Kolyma. It is a story that is largely forgotten in most history books today. Each prison and gulag Stanley is sent is no place to call home. In order to survive the un-survivable, the prisoners must work in collaboration with each other. Of the unknown hundreds of thousands sent to the Siberian gulags, only 583 Polish prisoners would return, one of them being Stanley Kowalski. This is his story.
