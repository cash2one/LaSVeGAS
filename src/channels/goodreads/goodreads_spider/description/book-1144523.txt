1144523:::::The Dark Horse:::::SIG IS A boy in a coastal tribe, the Storn, long ago in a Northern land. On the day of the wolf hunt, the life of the tribe changes forever, for Sig rescues a small girl, more like the wolves who shelter her than a human. Sig s family adopts her and names her Mouse, and he becomes a loyal brother to this girl with mysterious powers and a secret past. The shocking discovery of Mouse s true identity brings to life a terrifying legend and leads to war, betrayal, and Sig s coming of age as he finds the wit and courage to save his tribe. Like an ancient cave painting come to life, Sedgwick s tale of dark enchantment depicts a primitive tribe in a north country.
