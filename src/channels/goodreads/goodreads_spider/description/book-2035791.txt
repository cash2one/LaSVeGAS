Lucy Lombard thought her 'Happily Ever After' was all sewn up when her gorgeous boss Aidan declared his love for her, but she's just caught him in bed with another woman. As always, she's not the only one with problems - Autumn's new boyfriend has yet to meet her parents, Nadia's husband swears he's given up gambling but she just can't trust him, and Chantal is hoping to save her marriage, but not in quite the way she'd expected. It's not surprising that these girls are going to need a lot of chocolate to see them through the challenges that lie ahead...
