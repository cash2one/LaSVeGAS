18221899:::::Reborn:::::"The Serendipitous Curse of Solomon Brandt is seriously cool, and another winner for Aiden James! This time he teams up with the talented Lisa Collicutt--and what a fantastic team it is!" ~J.R. Rain, Bestselling author of Moon River and Silent Echo Since the Civil War, the name Solomon Brandt, has been reviled, a painful reminder to all descendants of the slaves the wicked plantation owner cruelly tortured. When a man bearing this cursed name stumbles into the heart of Savannah and its storied history, he can't help but attract the attention of the locals in the know. A seemingly kindhearted amnesiac, he is drawn to an ancient and haunted plantation home that bears his name, as well as to a Hoodoo practitioner who converses with spirits, and her gorgeous green-eyed niece. But curses run deep, and Solomon's crippling nightmares tell him more than he cares to know - or bear. Immersed in wickedness long ago, he has been given a second chance to set things right and redeem his feared name. Will he use the life he once took for granted to save the hearts - and lives - of the women he cherishes most? Or will the bloodthirsty Solomon of ages past reign once more, in the modern age?
