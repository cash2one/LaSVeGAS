29974583:::::Parrish:::::Sadie Smith was absolutely certain of three things: (1) ghosts were indisputably real; (2) she and her three friends were some of the best (though not the most successful) ghost hunters in Oregon; (3) her teammate Jefferson Parrish was always the scariest thing in the room. In a face-off between supernatural beings and Jefferson's Tim Burton-esque vibe there really was no contest. But ghosts unsurprisingly can t help pay the rent. So when Sadie and her friends are offered an undisclosed sum of money from an anonymous client to find a link between four historical haunted locations, it s an easy sell. During their cross-country investigation, Sadie finds herself forgetting about Jefferson s macabre tendencies and falling for his sweetness, even if his idea of a love letter reads more like a note from a serial killer. And she can t stop thinking about his annoyingly irresistible deep green eyes. As Sadie s feelings get more tangled up with Jefferson, their group puts together the final pieces of a 100 year old mystery one that will change Sadie s life forever.
