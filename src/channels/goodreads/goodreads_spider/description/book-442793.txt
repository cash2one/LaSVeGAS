442793:::::Fuzz:::::-- In Fuzz the 87th Precinct is up against the Deaf Man, master criminal. In a race to stop a string of brutal murders, cops work overtime walking the frozen streets, lying in stinking alleyways, making calls, tapping phones, and wearing disguises, to catch a killer from preying on more victims...including themselves!
