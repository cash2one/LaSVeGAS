10473353:::::"There Are Things I Want You to Know" about Stieg Larsson and Me:::::Here is the real inside story not the one about the Stieg Larsson phenomenon, but rather the love story of a man and a woman whose lives came to be guided by politics and love, coffee and activism, writing and friendship. Only one person in the world knows that story well enough to tell it with authority. Her name is Eva Gabrielsson. Eva Gabrielsson and Stieg Larsson shared everything, starting when they were both eighteen until his untimely death thirty-two years later at the age of fifty. In There Are Things I Want You to Know about Stieg Larsson and Me, Eva Gabrielsson accepts the daunting challenge of telling the story of their shared life steeped in love and sharpened in the struggle for justice and human rights. She chooses to tell it in short, spare, lyrical chapters, like snapshots, regaling Larsson s readers with the inside account of how he wrote, why he wrote, who the sources were for Lisbeth and his other characters graciously answering Stieg Larsson s readers most pressing questions and at the same time telling us the things we didn t know we wanted to know about love and loss, death, betrayal, and the mistreatment of women.
