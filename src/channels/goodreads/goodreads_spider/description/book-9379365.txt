9379365:::::The Book of Awesome:::::From the author of the #1 International Bestseller "The Book of Awesome" and the award-winning, multimillion-hit website 1000awesomethings.com comes... EVEN MORE of the little things that make us smile every day! Neil Pasricha is back with a collection of hundreds more awesome things that deserve celebration including: Coming back to your own bed after a long trip Sneaking cheaper candy into the movie theater Stepping on dry crunchy leaves on the sidewalk Letting go of the gas pump perfectly so you end on a round number When a baby falls asleep on you Finally peeing after holding it forever Pulling a weed and getting all the roots with it Seeing old people holding hands When your pet notices you're in a bad mood and comes to see you When your windshield wipers match the beat of the song you're listening to The smooth feeling on your teeth after you get your braces off When the hiccups stop Driving from a rough road onto a smooth one Puppy breath When the houseguest leaves When the person you're meeting is even later than you are Getting the keys to your first apartment There's even space for you to write your very own Awesome Things in the back. Because couldn't we all use (even more) AWESOME!?
