First in an Action-Packed Ten Book Fantasy Series- a Classic Coming of Age Adventure in a Thrilling New World of Magic. Mind reading twins, Meghan and Colin Jacoby, have until the rising of the blue moon to save the life of a young man whose family is forced to flee through a magical portal to another world, without him. In the process, they unknowingly break a spell and awaken an ancient dark magic, which has an unfortunate side effect: now they are being hunted too! In Book One Meghan and Colin Jacoby are looking forward to a typical summer vacation, which means their guardian (and uncle) will pull into the Cobbscott Campground just off the coast of Maine and park his travel trailer for three full months. Normally, they d never spend more than a few weeks in any one place, their uncle preferring to stay on the move. Why did he do this? The twins have never thought to ask. Their only concern being that their friend Sebastien will be in Cobbscott as well... the one person who also happens to know their secret- the twins are telepathic and can read each other s minds. A supernatural secret they ve never even told their Guardian. Within hours of arrival, Meghan and Colin are making plans to meet up with Sebastien but before they can, unexpected guests arrive. Guests with reserved campsites reserved, but unused for years. And even more mysterious is that within hours, it s clear these new visitors did not come alone! Something else has followed them. Something dangerous, and evil, with an eerie shadow that flies across the tree tops screeching out a warning that can have only one meaning: we know where you are
