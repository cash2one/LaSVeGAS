7607918:::::Yayati: A Classic Tale of Lust:::::The story of Yayati is perhaps one of the most intriguing and fascinating episodes of Mahabharata. Yayati was a great scholar and one of the noblest rulers of olden times. He followed the shastras and was devoted to the welfare of his subjects.

His quest for the carnal continued, sparing not even his youngest son, and exchanging his old age for his son s youth.
