The year is 1886 and Swedish teenager Ingrid Andersdotter is about to face a series of life-changing events the rural poverty of her family which her carelessness suddenly makes worse, her attraction to the new school teacher which leads to ostracism and shame, the pressure of the church to conform to things she doesn t believe, and her strong opinions which put her at odds with her traditional community. Ingrid s only option is to leave her home and family, first to Stockholm as a lonely servant in a rich household, where she soon discovers her vulnerability. Just when she fears she ll be thrown onto the street, a turn of events gives her the chance of a new life in America. But is she brave enough to make an ocean crossing to a strange land on her own, leaving everything she knows far behind? And will she find the freedom she dreams of if she takes such a risk? Told through the lens of a Swedish fairy tale, this epic coming-of-age story, is both a page-turning personal account of one feisty young woman s determination to seek a better life, and the tale of many single women who emigrated from Sweden to America in the 19th century.
