17081593:::::I Am Her...:::::A sometimes funny, tragically graphic, compelling tale of a woman suffering... ***WARNING- GRAPHIC CONTENT and THEMES *** She has no name of her own. She is every name everyone has ever called her. She is nameless. She has a good job, a beautiful home and a wonderful husband. She is everything she was supposed to be. She has structure and stability, but she is lost. She is trying. Her whole life is spent trying; yet her whole life has been nothing but an apology. She is so tired of trying and failing. In just one week, she learns her entire life is a series of brutalities. She learns intense, consuming passion for the first time with a beautiful stranger. She learns love within this passion, and she learns heartbreak while without. Slowly her breakdown overcomes her. She tries to rise above her circumstances, but when she has nothing left to fight with; she tries to ease the pain forever. Desperately, she fights her way through the agony of life, and she returns with a gentle hope. She wants to live, and she wants to love, for the first time in her life. Now, she has a name. Now, she can be 'her'... Any HER that she wants to be.
