49231:::::The Diamond in Your Pocket: Discovering Your True Radiance:::::The Diamond in Your Pocket, the first major book release from Gangaji, describes our ever-ending search to find fulfillment, which, paradoxically, already exists if we will only stop long enough to discover its true source. Now, this modern-day classic is available in two new formats: paperback and a multi-CD audio recording in the author's own voice. "I have discovered that it is actually impossible to find happiness," teaches Gangaji. "As long as you are seeking to find happiness somewhere, you are overlooking where happiness is ... in your true nature." With The Diamond in Your Pocket, the American-born teacher who has influenced the lives of thousands through her retreats and public events helps us to reconcile the observations and questions that arise along the spiritual path. Like a precious gem, The Diamond in Your Pocket cuts through what is false, and illuminates what is true--a brilliant series of contemplations and insights you will want to hold dear and return to again and again. Gangaji shows us thought-by-thought how to stop the endless activity of our minds, and experience the brilliance and radiance of who we really are in every present moment.
