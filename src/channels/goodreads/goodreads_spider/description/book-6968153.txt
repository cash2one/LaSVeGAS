6968153:::::Dark Warrior Untamed:::::In Alexis Morgan s electrifying new Talion adventure, a sexy warrior fights to save his headstrong lover from the crossfire of an evil plot to overthrow the Kyth s leader. He questions everything. No one thought Chief Talion Greyhill Danby would report to work so soon after wrapping up his affairs in London. Then again, he didn t expect to find a beautiful spy with a major attitude in his new office. Clearly the Kyth s Grand Dame doesn t trust him to do his duty to protect her. She fears the truth. Piper Ryan isn t keen on the arrangement, either. Matching wits with an ancient warrior isn t in her administrative job description. But sharing space with the red-hot head of security could have unexpectedly tempting benefits . . . if he doesn t dig into her secret past. Opposites always attract. When threatening e-mails result in danger, the fiery sparks between Piper and Grey grow scorching hot. They must defend the throne from a deadly invisible attacker, but will their raging desire keep them together . . . or will their burning suspicions tear them apart?
