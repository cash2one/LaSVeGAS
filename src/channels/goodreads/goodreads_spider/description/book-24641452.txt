24641452:::::House On The Hill:::::Madison has been on a roll, lately. She was just named top attorney at her firm; things never looked better for her career. Best yet, Madison rarely thinks about her rocky past anymore. Life is good. But when her firm's CEO suddenly dies, Madison receives a surprise. Lars Eichmann has left his star attorney a very special gift. Madison is about to inherit, of all things.. a house. But she hasn't inherited just any house... Madison's new home, high atop a hill, is a beautiful, ornate, Victorian manse. The home is beautiful, but sometimes... strange. Immediately, odd things begin to happen. Things moving by themselves. Voices in the night. Soon, level headed Madison questions her own sanity. There's a ghost in that house on the hill, a ghost with an urgent need to talk. Can Madison suspect her doubt and fear? Will she survive the shock of what is to come? The woods surrounding the property hold a secret... A terrible secret that must come to light. Just when Madison feels close to her breaking point, one more terrible secret is revealed... One that will change her life forever.
