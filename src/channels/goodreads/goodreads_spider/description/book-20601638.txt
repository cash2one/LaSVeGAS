20601638:::::Reconquest: Mother Earth:::::SEAL Mitch Grace was among the first humans to see the aliens when they landed at the naval base where he was stationed, but like the rest of humanity, he was powerless to stop them. Five years later, Mitch awakens from a coma under the care of an alien physician to find that aliens control the planet. Starting alone, as a one man army, he rallies the surviving humans to build a resistance movement to take the planet back from the alien conquerors. After his capture by the aliens, Mitch is forced into intergalactic slavery to become a gladiator, fighting as the sole representative of the human species. Against all odds, and far from home, he lays the plans for the reconquest of his homeland. "Anybody can end the world, but few can do it with the blend of action, suspense, romance and even humor that Alves mixes up in this fantastic novel. A blast for anyone who enjoys a good tale, even those who rarely venture into science fiction. "Highly recommended." Brett J. Talley, Bram Stoker Award Nominated Author of "The Void" and "That Which Should Not Be." "A riotous mix of Independence Day and Red Dawn with a taste of the Thunderdome. The apocalypse has never been more fun." Tim Marquitz, author of the "Demon Squad" series.
