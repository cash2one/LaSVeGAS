But you will shoot, and shoot again and again while your shoulder aches from your musket's kick and the tight, disciplined red column bleeds and wavers and breaks and you begin to shout at the top of your lungs because you are there, at the birth of freedom you're a veteran of the Battle of Lexington, and you've helped whip the King's best soldiers...
