1203668:::::Revelation:::::During this savage civil war, all efforts to end Jacen Solo s tyranny of the Galactic Alliance have failed. Now with Jacen approaching the height of his dark powers, no one not even the Solos and the Skywalkers knows if anything can stop the Sith Lord before his plan to save the galaxy ends up destroying it. Jacen Solo s shadow of influence has threatened many, especially those closest to him. Jaina Solo is determined to bring her brother in, but in order to track him down, she must first learn unfamiliar skills from a man she finds ruthless, repellent, and dangerous. Meanwhile, Ben Skywalker, still haunted by suspicions that Jacen killed his mother, Mara, decides he must know the truth, even if it costs him his life. And as Luke Skywalker contemplates once unthinkable strategies to dethrone his nephew, the hour of reckoning for those on both sides draws near. The galaxy becomes a battlefield where all must face their true nature and darkest secrets, and live or die with the consequences.
