6641640:::::Howling for My Baby:::::Romeo and Juliet never had to worry about being skinned alive. Sydney Skeller s father is spitting bullets over her reluctance to join the family business as a shifter hunter. The last thing Daddy needs to know is why she yearns for a lover who s man enough for a relationship but animal enough to give her the wild ride of her dreams. After a treadmill mishap lands her in a tangled heap with Jason Cannon, she wonders if she s finally found her beast, er, man. One session in bed and one bite later, she s sure. Now if only she can keep her father from mounting Jason s head on a wall Jason is all man on the surface, but wolf shifter down to the bone. He s more than ready to stop playing the pack and find his one true mate, and Sydney of the luscious curves is the woman of his dreams. Finding out that she comes from a family sworn to eradicate his kind isn t a deal-breaker. But her outrageous plan for him to masquerade as the wolf in hunter s clothing, right under her father s very nose, could be asking more than he ever expected to give.
