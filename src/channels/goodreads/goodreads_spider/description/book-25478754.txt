25478754:::::Derora's Legend Part 1:::::Derora, Alluvius and Goldie fall into the Battle of the Bridge... two thousand years in the past... and then things go downhill from there. Der gets separated from the others when a teleporting demon snatches her out from falling into the Abyss... Derora finds herself rescued from the ocean by two bullied brothers, Rory and Conor, in a place where a stone knife is cutting edge technology. She's lost her powers, and is near death... The dog king is coming to destroy their home and their lives, and Der is too weak to fight back - even though that doesn't stop her from trying. As she slowly recovers, she learns that this island is the place where the Blackhound will come - and maybe she can find him first... and stop everything from happening, the fall of Pallens and the rise of Soschen who will unmake the world. But is she truly willing to do it, even at the cost of her very existence? Will Alluvius and Goldie find her before it's too late? Will Rory, Der and Conor find the Blackhound before he finds his destiny? Der will also have to contend with a mighty Pallens sorceress, a new dark paladin and Tom's dad - who is already in deep trouble with the law.
