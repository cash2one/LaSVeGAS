30739258:::::The Billionaire and His Castaway:::::Kenton Monroe has wanted her for far too long. But Madeline Caldwell isn t giving him the time of day. Madeline is looking to break out of her innocent shell, but Kenton definitely isn t the guy to experiment with. She needs a nice guy, not one who makes her lady business glitter like diamonds. Kenton has been patient for months, but she won t bend. Getting her alone on a deserted island is the only way. Keeping her stranded and all to himself will make her see reason. Right? Warning: If you like pina coladas and getting caught in the rain then maybe this dirty summer read is just for you. If you like making love at midnight, put this book down and wake your partner up!
