16159648:::::Fatal Descent:::::Between a rock and a hard paddle Mandy Tanner and her fiance Rob are leading an offseason rafting-climbing trip in Utah's remote Canyonlands. Experienced guides, Mandy and Rob know they have to keep their cool after one of their group, Alex Anderson, appears to have become bear bait. Walled off from the outside world with eleven shell-shocked clients and miles of Colorado River whitewater ahead, Mandy's nerves threaten to unravel when she learns that Alex's death was not the work of a homicidal grizzly. Whether it was a crime of passion or the random act of a psychopath, Mandy fears that if they don't root out the river rat among them, another camper will be running the rapids in a body bag.
