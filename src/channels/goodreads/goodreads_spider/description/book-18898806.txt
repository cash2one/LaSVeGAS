18898806:::::Boaz Brown:::::In this daring debut novel, a young Christian woman finds her own racist attitudes as well as those of her family, friends, and church challenged when she is drawn to a man of a different race. Smart-talking LaShondra Smith and her girlfriends all face the same relationship issue-where to find a good man. They yearn to meet a strong, confident man who loves God, just like Boaz in the Bible. The problem is that they don't just want a godly man, they want a godly black man. Enter Stetson Brown, a handsome engineer and faithful man of God who matches LaShondra's wit, style, and values, but happens to be of a different race. But will LaShondra be able to overcome the beliefs that she and everyone around her supports and has grown up with, in order to open herself to the true love of Stetson and God?
