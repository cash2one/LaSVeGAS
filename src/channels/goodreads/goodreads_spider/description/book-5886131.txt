5886131:::::Shadow Magic:::::Led to victory by its magic-fueled Dragon Corps, Volstov has sent a delegation to its conquered neighbors to work out the long-awaited terms of peace.

The hidden truth is that the new emperor is harboring a treacherous secret and once it is revealed, Alcibiades and Caius may be powerless to stop it.
