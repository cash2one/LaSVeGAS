378519:::::The Cupid Chronicles:::::When the only library in Bramble, Cape Cod, announces it's in danger of closing its doors, the town residents have got to raise BIG money and FAST. Thirteen-year-old Willa Havisham must put her crush on Joey Kennelly on the back burner to save the library, but the question is: How?Willa's best friend, Tina, is positive that her compatibility test, expertly designed to match up every girl in school with her "perfect match," will raise the money "and" get everyone paired up for the Midwinter Night's Ball. Willa, an old-fashioned romantic, is not so sure. But with a little help from Shakespeare, a Southern beauty queen, and Cupid himself, romance is striking all over Bramble. Readers will be swooning until the stroke of midnight with this delightful sequel to "The Wedding Planner's Daughter."
