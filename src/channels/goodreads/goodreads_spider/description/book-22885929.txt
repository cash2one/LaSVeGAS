22885929:::::Just Around The Bend: Mas o Menos:::::Apparently, just around the bend is everything we ve been looking forward to including world peace, winning the lottery and a blissful retirement. Regrettably however, the energy and drive most of us need to enjoy them, should they materialise, have been left way behind us in a place called The Past . The buzz word is Now but somehow we always seem to be either side of it. We re far too busy with daily rituals to consider what homilies like Know Thyself , and Who am I? really mean. Maybe we ve missed something along the way and prefer to live with the mystery of it all. Paying close attention to our thoughts, reactions and feelings reveals a great deal about us, but only if we re willing to let go of pain and suffering; these cunning obstacles need to be faced rather than pushed to one side. When we truly want to return to completeness, no power on earth will be able to stop us. If you re up to examining your mind whilst I examine mine, then flip the book over and let s get started. Just Around The Bend: M s o Menos is my second book. Unusually, for its genres (self-help, philosophy etc.), it s illustrated with a little character I designed and call Dilly (which means something or someone remarkable). Dilly is a thought form that thinks and he depicts some of our most endearing (and not so endearing) human traits. Ebooks are not illustrated
