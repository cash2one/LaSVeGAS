22007450:::::Immortal Dreams:::::3 Stories 3 Immortal Dreams 3 Immortal Destinies From time travel, to witches and vampires, to forgotten goddesses, this anthology has it all with these three novels. Book 1 - Blood's Fury (Deadly Beauties #1) The world is laid out in black in white through the eyes of Alyssa Coldwell, until she stumbles into the gray area she naively refused to believe existed. Between love she never thought she'd find and the dangers of the world she can't accept, hope almost becomes a fantasy. Book 2 - Eternal Vows (Book 1 in the Ruby Ring Saga) by Chrissy Peebles Never Marry a stranger... even if he is a drop-dead gorgeous immortal king. Never pretend to be a princess. And most importantly... never slip on an ancient wedding ring you know nothing about. Sarah Larker returns to a cave where her sister disappeared ten years earlier. She walks through a portal and is mistaken for a runaway princess on the run by a dangerous immortal king in medieval times. Her plan is bold as well as daring - become the princess, wed the king, and slip on an ancient wedding ring that will unlock the portal back home. Then find her sister and run as fast as she can out of Dodge. But taking on the identity of Princess Gloria comes along with dangerous consequences; and slipping on the ruby ring comes with an even higher price. Book 3 - Daughter of Aphrodite (The Daughter Trilogy #1) Falling in love with someone who has secrets is always a problem, but learning secrets about yourself... that's life changing. The greek immortals didn't disappear; they live among us, blending into society, and fighting wars lost on our eyes. As a courtesy, the authors of this anthology wish to inform you these are the first books in separate series.
