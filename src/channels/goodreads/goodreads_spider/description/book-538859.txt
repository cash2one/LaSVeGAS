538859:::::Without Dogma:::::In Without dogma Sienkiewicz decided to move away from the historical novel genre that gave him fame and write about contemporary issues, being the problem of late nineteenth-century man, devoid of moral principles and lasting purpose in life, to which he could pursue. He wrote a psychological novel, in which the romantic plot was a pretext for showing the hero's mental states and self-analysis of his experiences. Due to its subject and the lack of explicit condemnation of the main character, this book aroused heated discussions and sparked allegations of a-morality. For many young people Without the dogma was the diagnosis of their generation.
