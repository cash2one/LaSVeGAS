13549588:::::Whats that Super Model Doing in my Workplace?:::::In What's that Super Model doing in My Workplace?, author Halinka Panzera explains why now given Globalisation and faltering economies we need to seek leaders with different characteristics. Social and economic change means that business behaviour needs to adapt. A profit-only, homogeneous male-dominated, institutionalised, single-minded approach to business will no longer secure business success in the future. We are already seeing decline in corporate performance among companies that are adhering to older models. A more broad-minded, balanced outlook that incorporates wider societal characteristics and priorities is needed. An organisation needs to develop a wide range of solutions to any given problem. Says Halinka Panzera, "When organisations try to replicate the type of leadership they have had in the past, they don't maximise their problem solving. This 'dinosaur' style has had its day." The Super Model has been created by research insights and provides a new approach for problem solving for CEO's, HR, Management, and new Leaders. Corporate evolution is possible, with insightful, evolving and confident people leading the way and willing to embrace change by contributing diverse thoughts, ideas and perspectives. This book shows you how.
