971322:::::The Wanderers:::::The Wanderers, a teen-age gang in the Bronx of the early Sixties, are just trying to stay alive--and maybe have a little sex. But it's not going to be easy. They're facing murderous parents, unimpressed girls, and all-Chinese gang and a pack of mute Irish maniacs, apathetic teachers, and a ten-year-old cold-blooded killer. Will The Wanderers be alive a week from now? Will the girls come across? This is fantastically powerful and funny fiction--psychological realism to a doo-wop beat. " A deeply moving account of confused and spiritually underprivileged youth ." -- William S. Burroughs " I haven't read a better fictional account of the dark side of the American dream in years ." -- John Fowles Written when the author was twenty-four, this story was the basis for a major feature film.
