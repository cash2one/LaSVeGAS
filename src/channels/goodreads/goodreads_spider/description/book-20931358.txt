20931358:::::Alyce An Alternate Version of the Prince's Ball:::::Alyce has never dreamed of visiting the king. To a member of a minority group that opposes his rule, his brooding, glum palace is associated only with imprisonment and death. Though it's been a long time since any Sherban was arrested, Alyce feels little in common with her ruler and is quite content to stay unnoticed. Until a mandatory summons to the King's court dance leaves her no choice. An older, alternate version of The Prince's Ball. Shorter and with a different ending.
