It's the story of Eleanor Bee, a shy book-loving girl who vows to turn herself into someone bright, shiny, and confident, someone sophisticated. Someone who knows how life works. But life has a funny way of catching us unawares. Turns out that Elle doesn't know everything about love. Or life. Or how to keep the ones we love safe... Absorbing, poignant, and unforgettable, Happily Ever After is a compelling story of a fractured family and a girl who doesn't believe in love.
