13510297:::::Flights from the Lowlands:::::An extraordinary woman s early writings capture both the stirrings of her individual spirit and her distinct observations of early 20th century America its legacies and struggles. Flights from the Lowlands was first published by Florence Rose s son, Ward, for an Okmulgee [Oklahoma] High School printing project in 1935. Two daughters, Irva Rose Montijo and Nadine Rose Frary Kimball edited and published Flights from the Lowlands again in 1982, and her eldest granddaughter, Edi Montijo Chapman has edited this third edition. These early poems are for readers to devour or browse as they wish. Florence Rose would be delighted to know her words are finding new minds to stir. Poems in this collection feature local and international topics of the day; of the survival struggles in the Depression; of relationships; of heroes; of the angst of writing, and many celebrate the joy of life and beauties of nature. Flight itself was a very contemporary enterprise, intriguing the author, even before she took her first flight. Ancient Greek heroes, American Revolutionaries, post-Civil War contemporaries and family all inspired Florence s writing.
