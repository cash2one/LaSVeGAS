1179956:::::October Ferry To Gabriola:::::October Ferry to Gabriola, like Malcolm Lowry's generously praised Under the Volcano, is a romantic, convoluted prose journey in quest of an easeful death. It is not a completed novel, however. According to Margerie Lowry, the author's widow, this published version is her "sorting out" of numerous drafts of chapters, paragraphs and even sentences that Lowry began to write in 1946.
