Evie and Shon Adze aren't just sisters, they're soul-mates, and when Shon is brutally murdered by her boyfriend, Evie's life is shattered. Her only consolation is that the murderer will be caught and punished but when he escapes and flees the country Evie vows that someone else will have to pay for her sister's death. This 'someone' is another 'murdering bastard' sent to trial in a similar case and Evie focuses all her impotent rage on him. She makes a plan and moves inexorably towards her goal. Nothing deters her until she meets Dan Kinelly, an Irish journalist and her colleague on The Chronicle. Their blossoming relationship throws Evie's resolve into doubt but when she discovers that Dan has been using her to get information about her sister's murder she's back on that single track -- the track leading to vengeance.
