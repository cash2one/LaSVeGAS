23095964:::::As Far as My Feet Will Carry Me:::::This book tells the story of Clemens Forell, a German soldier sentenced to 25 years of forced labour in a Siberian lead mine after the Second World War. Made desperate by the brutality of conditions in the camp, Forell staged a daring escape, resulting in an 8,000 mile journey across the trackless wastes of Siberia. His only goal was to return home to his wife and his two children. Based on a long series of interviews with Forell, Josef Bauer's account evokes Forell's desperation in the prison camp, his lonely flight across one of the most treacherous and inhospitable regions on earth, and the ever-present terror of recapture as he makes his way towards the Persian frontier and freedom.
