23174504:::::Invent-10n:::::Greetings Gate, let s Agitate. Look over your shoulder. Do you see the camera? Then dig that even as you read these words of sedition and denial you are being watched by the ever e-quisitive National Protection Agency. The National Protection Agency omnipresent, omniscient and most ominous which runs PanOptika, the spider at the centre of the Web. PanOptika. What s the slogan: watching out for the good guys by watching out for the bad guys. But what did that Roman word-slinger, Juvenal say? Quis custodiet ipsos custodes: who watches the watchers? So dig this to the extremity, cats and kittens: if we do nothing soon we must kneel, digitally-dutiful, before National Protection, and then there will be no chance to zig when the ChumBots say zag, or to beep when they say bop. Realise thou that PanOptika triumphant means we will not be able to think, to act, to speak or to move without the spirit-sapping realisation that the badniks know everything everything. * We are circling the drain. This is my warning. * Set in 2030, Invent-10n follows the story of Jenni-Fur and Sebastian and the invention of a power source that will solve all our energy issues; or will it?
