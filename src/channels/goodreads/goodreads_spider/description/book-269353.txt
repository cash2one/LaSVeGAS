269353:::::Louis Riel: A Comic-Strip Biography:::::"It has the thoroughness of a history book yet reads with the personalized vision of a novel." - Time Chester Brown reinvents the comic-book medium to create the critically acclaimed historical biography Louis Riel , winning the Harvey Awards for best writing and best graphic novel for his compelling, meticulous, and dispassionate retelling of the charismatic, and perhaps insane, nineteenth-century M tis leader. Brown coolly documents with dramatic subtlety the violent rebellion on the Canadian prairie led by Riel, who some regard a martyr who died in the name of freedom, while others consider him a treacherous murderer.
