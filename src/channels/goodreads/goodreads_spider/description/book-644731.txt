644731:::::White Palace:::::Max is twenty-seven and recently, tragically widowed. He s an advertising copywriter on his way up. To his shock and confusion, he suddenly finds himself in the midst of the affair of his life an incongruous passion for a lusty, hard-drinking forty-two-year-old White Palace waitress. She s from the wrong side of town. She s undereducated. She doesn t begin to compare to Janey, Max s lost wife. But Max can t escape his obsession for the salty, sultry, sensuous Nora. Though the affair begins with their raw carnal attraction, Max discovers, to his horror, that he may be falling in love with this woman from Dogtown. In his first novel, Glenn Savan presents a steamy love dilemma with wit and compassion. In Max and Nora, he creates two unforgettable characters who rival any oddball duo in contemporary literature.
