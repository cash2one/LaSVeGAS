11841579:::::The Unbecoming of Mara Dyer:::::When Mara Dyer wakes up in hospital with no memory of how she got there, or any explanation as to why the bizarre accident that caused the deaths of her boyfriend and two best friends left her mysteriously unharmed, her doctors suggest that she start over in a new city, at a new school, and just hope her memories gradually come back. But Mara's new start is anything but comforting. She sees the faces of her dead friends everywhere and now she's started to see other peoples deaths before they happen. Is she going crazy?
