25169466:::::The Unreals:::::Drawing its inspiration from novels like 1984 and Gravity`s Rainbow, with a dash of Alice in Wonderland and The Wizard Of Oz thrown in for good measure, The Unreals is an off-the-wall, thought-provoking, and very funny slice of fantasy. The plot revolves around an eccentric young man`s search for his grandfather, who has mysteriously vanished, leaving a strange note behind as the only clue. A crazy and memorable cross-country search ensues, which includes towns and persons with names all related to the JFK assassination, exit signs and roads that seem imaginary, totally outrageous characters that appear and disappear with ease, and a magical, time-traveling cornfield. When the action moves to the Extremely Unreachable Ward in the sub-basement of a notorious mental institution, the fun really begins.
