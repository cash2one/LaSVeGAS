163677:::::Educating Esme: Diary of a Teacher's First Year:::::A must-read for parents, new teachers, and classroom veterans, Educating Esm is the exuberant diary of Esm Raji Codell s first year teaching in a Chicago public school. Fresh-mouthed and free-spirited, the irrepressible Madame Esm as she prefers to be called does the cha-cha during multiplication tables, roller-skates down the hallways, and puts on rousing performances with at-risk students in the library. Her diary opens a window into a real-life classroom from a teacher s perspective. While battling bureaucrats, gang members, abusive parents, and her own insecurities, this gifted young woman reveals what it takes to be an exceptional teacher. Heroine to thousands of parents and educators, Esm now shares more of her ingenious and yet down-to-earth approaches to the classroom in a supplementary guide to help new teachers hit the ground running. As relevant and iconoclastic as when it was first published, Educating Esm is a classic, as is Madame Esm herself.
