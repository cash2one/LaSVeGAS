44755:::::Bride Of Pendorric / The Shadow Of Lynx / King Of The Castle / Mistress Of Mellyn:::::Bride of Pendorric-Swept into marriage by the dashing young heir of Pendorric, Favel was dazed with happiness - until she realized someone wanted her to join the other legendary "Brides of Pendorric," who had all died so mysteriously, and so tragically. The Shadow of the Lynx-To be hated by Lynx would be terrifying and to be loved by him perhaps even more so. He loved Nora, his English ward, and he hated those who had caused him to arrive in Australia as a convict. Now rich and powerful, he seeks revenge and Nora becomes unwillingly involved. King of the Castle-Dallas found there was more, much more, to be restored in the Chateau Gaillard than a mere collection of pictures. The strange household and its inhabitants fascinated Dallas so much that she could not leave, despite the Comte de la Talle's wild and undisciplined daughter denouncing him as her mother's murderer. Mistress of Mellyn-To become a governess was the only course open to a lonely Victorian girl but tempestuous, attractive Martha hated the idea. Only the growing love for her first charge and an unwilling attraction for the father made her stay and try to solve the mysteries which shrouded their lives in tragedy.
