542785:::::The Milkweed Prophesy: Epitaph of the Apocalypse:::::THE MILKWEED PROPHESY;EPITAPH OF THE APOCALYPSE, is an incredible and in-depth explanation of not only the Apocalypse, but told from an an actual "involvement" where the author herself ensplenders her own emotional framework in a manner of religious literature that has never been captured before. All of these events were based solely upon the Professor's lifetime of visions and actual "visitations' and apparitions and actual visitations of Mary, the Mother of God, and actual accounted events that have been witnessed by credible people. This book of uncommon insights will starled the mind, and very heart of the reader, as he is taken on horseback into the actual Apocalypse, and stares face to face with the Devil himself-LUCIFER! The near possesion this young author claims boldly, as this was also documented and witnessed, but the literal "protection" from God saved Milkweed after her only suicide attempt. This book powerfully illustrates what it is truely like to be a believer, but one who is chosen long ago to understand and to teach, and even now fooling her medical doctors and living well beyond her expected time alotted to her, but still extremely deteriorated from this catastrophic termainl illness that plagues her mysterious life. This work, "divinely" inspired, is highly reccommended for anyone who truely wants and needs to know about the Book of God's Revelations, as well as about himself. This same remarkible book of stunning words translate themselves likend to the Bible, as the author clearly defines herself, but without ever in abruption of the eternal glory of God. Her impressive artwork, as well as photography, is also here to enlighten and illuminate the mind, and to hopefully make all understand the truth of God's Kingdom, and the ultimate sacrifice; the cricifixion and dereliction of our God-Jesus the Christ!
