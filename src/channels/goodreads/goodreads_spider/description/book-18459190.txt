18459190:::::Welcome to the Dark House:::::What s your worst nightmare? For Ivy Jensen, it s the eyes of a killer that haunt her nights. For Parker Bradley, it s bloodthirsty sea serpents that slither in his dreams. And for seven essay contestants, it s their worst nightmares that win them an exclusive, behind-the-scenes look at director Justin Blake s latest, confidential project. Ivy doesn t even like scary movies, but she s ready to face her real-world fears. Parker s sympathetic words and perfect smile help keep her spirits up. . . at least for now. Not everyone is so charming, though. Horror-film fanatic Garth Vader wants to stir up trouble. It s bad enough he has to stay in the middle of nowhere with this group the girl who locks herself in her room; the know-it-all roommate; Mister Sensitive ; and the one who s too cheery for her own good. Someone has to make things interesting. Except, things are already a little weird. The hostess is a serial-killer look-alike, the dream-stealing Nightmare Elf is lurking about, and the seventh member of the group is missing. By the time Ivy and Parker realize what s really at stake, it s too late to wake up and run.
