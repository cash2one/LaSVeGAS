22756194:::::Coffee House Lies: 100 Cups of Flash fiction:::::These fun-sized stories are just right for a coffee break, public commute, waiting room, bedtime story, or any other time you want a quick trip without leaving the farm. The 100 stories in this quirky collection range from a few sentences to a few pages. Included are stories nominated for the 2013 Pushcart Prize, Micro Award, and Wigleaf Long List. Nearly all of them have been published before individually, in numerous print and online magazines and anthologies. Tales vary from realistic to humorous to surreal, and family-friendly to adult. Repeating themes include: people-as-animals, people losing themselves and finding themselves (and sometimes wishing they hadn't), childhood in the psychedelic seventies, reality TV, marriage, twisted religion, and of course the gotta have 'em he-done-me wrongs. Enjoy!
