15749268:::::Strength Life Legacy:::::Strength, Life, Legacy........... This is not just a book of training routines. This is my entire philosophy about life, strength building, being a better man, brother, son, husband, father, and lifter. It is about being a lifer, and what that means to me. I have poured as much of myself as I could into this book, and I if it can help you in any way, that is the ultimate gift to me. That someone else can benefit from the mistakes I have made, and the lessons I have learned. Both in life, and lifting. Training wise, it contains the new big-15 and strong-15 programs. Along with pause squat cycles, block deadlift cycles, stiff legged cycles, strongman deadlift routines, and LOTS more. I have NO DOUBT, that the principles in this book will help make you a better lifter in some way, shape, or form, and hopefully a better man......or woman!
