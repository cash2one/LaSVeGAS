12988478:::::The Care and Feeding of Stray Vampires:::::Iris Scanlon, Half-Moon Hollow s only daytime vampire concierge, knows more about the undead than she d like. Running all their daylight errands from letting in the plumber to picking up some chilled O neg gives her a look at the not-so-glamorous side of vampire life. Her rules are strict; relationships with vamps are strictly business, not friendship and certainly not anything else. But then she finds her newest client, Cal, poisoned on his kitchen floor, and only Iris can help. Cal - who would be devastatingly sexy, if Iris allowed herself to think that way - offers Iris a hefty fee for hiding him at her place until he figures out who wants him permanently dead. Even though he s imperious, unfriendly and doesn't seem to understand the difference between "employee" and "servant," Iris agrees, and finds herself breaking more and more of her own rules to help him - particularly those concerning nudity. Turns out what her quiet little life needed was some intrigue &amp; romance in the form of her very own stray vampire.
