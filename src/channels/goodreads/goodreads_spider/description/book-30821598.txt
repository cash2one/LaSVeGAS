30821598:::::My Not So Perfect Life:::::Katie Brenner has the perfect life: a flat in London, a glamorous job, and a super-cool Instagram feed. OK, so the truth is that she rents a tiny room with no space for a wardrobe, has a hideous commute to a lowly admin job, and the life she shares on Instagram isn t really hers. But one day her dreams are bound to come true, aren t they? Until her not-so-perfect life comes crashing down when her mega-successful boss Demeter gives her the sack. All Katie s hopes are shattered. She has to move home to Somerset, where she helps her dad with his new glamping business. Then Demeter and her family book in for a holiday, and Katie sees her chance. But should she get revenge on the woman who ruined her dreams - or try to get her job back? Does Demeter the woman who has everything actually have such an idyllic life herself? Maybe they have more in common than it seems. And what s wrong with not-so-perfect, anyway?
