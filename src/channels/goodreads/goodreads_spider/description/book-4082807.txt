Horab Greenbloom, an immensely wealthy Oxford student forces John to face himself and come to terms with his past. Reviews of In The Time Of Greenbloom "This brilliant book is written with such absolute command of language and the technique of fiction, with such narrative power and psychological insight, that it leaves one bedazzled with admiration. Gabriel Fielding's use of dialogue is expert. He is marvelously adroit at creating several exuberantly whacky characters. His account of the state of frozen emotional shock and spiritual isolation into which his young hero retreats is psychologically persuasive. It is also genuinely touching. So many literary virtues insure in The Time of Greenbloom,s complete success as a work of fiction" -Orville Prescott , The New York Times "An excellent book, rich in beauty, subtle analysis and creeping menace" -Luther Nichols, San Francisco Examiner "Like the author of Tom Jones, Gabriel Fielding had an ironic turn of phrase and a gift for flamboyant character, but he resembles more closely the late Joyce Cary in his episodic plotting and his concern for the relationship of God and man." -Time
