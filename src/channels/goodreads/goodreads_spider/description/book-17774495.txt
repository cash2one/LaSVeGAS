17774495:::::Outcast:::::After six years of angels coming out of the sky and taking people from her town, 16-year-old Riley Carver has just about had it living with the constant fear. When one decides to terrorize her in her own backyard, it s the final straw. She takes her mother s shotgun and shoots the thing. So it s dead. Or not? In place of the creature she shot, is a guy. A really hot guy. A really hot alive and breathing guy. Oh, and he s totally naked. Not sure what to do, she drags his unconscious body to the tool shed and ties him up. After all, he s an angel and they have tricks. When he regains consciousness she s all set to interrogate him about why the angels come to her town, and how to get back her best friend (and almost boyfriend) Chris, who was taken the year before. But it turns out the naked guy in her shed is just as confused about everything as she is. He thinks it s 1956. Set in the deep south, OUTCAST is a story of love, trust, and coming of age. It s also a story about the supernatural, a girl with a strange sense of humor who s got wicked aim, a greaser from the 50 s, and an army of misfits coming together for one purpose: To kick some serious angel ass.
