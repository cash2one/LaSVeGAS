655570:::::Island of the Lost: Shipwrecked at the Edge of the World:::::Auckland Island is a godforsaken place in the middle of the Southern Ocean, 285 miles south of New Zealand. With year-round freezing rain and howling winds, it is one of the most forbidding places in the world. To be shipwrecked there means almost certain death. Using the survivors' journals and historical records, award-winning maritime historian Joan Druett brings the extraordinary untold story of two shipwrecks on the same island at the same time to life, a story about leadership and the fine line between order and chaos.
