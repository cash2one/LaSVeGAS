Someone not easily noticed; a proficient dancer, quiet, and even-tempered. ...so do certain men Thief-taker Jasper Bond is entirely too large, too handsome, and too dangerous. Who would believe that an intellectual like Eliza would be seduced by a man of action? But the combination of her stubbornness and the mystery makes the case one Jasper can't resist. Client satisfaction is a point of pride and it's his pleasure to prove he's just the man she needs after all... "The undisputed mistress of tender, erotic romance." --Teresa Medeiros
