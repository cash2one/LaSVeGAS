168283:::::Candido:::::Candido, or A Dream dreamed in Sicily , is about a character stricken from birth with a strange disability: a devotion to naked, unadorned truth. Child, adolescent and man, he is drawn into many difficulties by his affliction. "Things are always simple," he says-in religion, politics and human affairs. But the Lie is at work, and the consequences are all too clear in Candido's Sicily - a land 'dreamed', but no less real for that. Untruth comes in a dozen shapes and brings with it a huge burden of injustice and suffering. It can be outfaced only by innocence.
