13177880:::::Spell Caster:::::"As author of this book. I am a fiction lover, especially fantasy fiction, and I believe in bible prophecy. I have put in everything about what I believe, in this story. All things are possible, if we can acknowledge the facts. I believe that no one can tell the future, they can only show or tell you what they believe in, and what they see. The bible gives references as well as science; about future changes, that are going to take place; such as War in the heaven s, signs in the universe and earth, and a one world order, by a false deception. I have been studying science and bible prophecy for twenty years. Over the years, some of these predictions have already taken place; biblically and scientifically. I believe that some day, we ll be living in the Dark Age"
