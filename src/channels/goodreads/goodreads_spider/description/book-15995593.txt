15995593:::::Charmed Spirits:::::Jordan Cross has returned to Holiday, Montana after eleven long years to clear out her late aunt s house, put it on the market, and figure out what she wants to do with the rest of her life. Soon, she finds herself facing the town that turned its back on her because she was different. Because being labeled a witch in a small town didn t earn her many friends...especially when it wasn't a lie. Matt Cooper has lived in Holiday his whole life. He's perfectly content being a bachelor alongside his four single brothers in a very small town. After all, the only woman he'd ever loved ran out on him without a goodbye. But now Jordan s back and just as bewitching as ever. Can they rekindle their romance with a town set against them? Warning: Contains an intelligent, sexy witch with an attitude and drop-dead gorgeous man who likes to work with his hands, holds a secret that might scare someone, and really, really, likes table tops for certain activities. Enough said.
