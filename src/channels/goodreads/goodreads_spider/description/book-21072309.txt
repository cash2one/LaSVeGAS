21072309:::::Moorcock's Multiverse:::::Featuring some of Moorcock's earliest works, MOORCOCK'S MULTIVERSE contains the seeds of the overarching concepts that tie all of his varied worlds together. Here, in THE SUNDERED WORLDS, THE FIRECLOWN and THE TWILIGHT MAN, the multiverse is introduced and various aspects of the eternal champion, Moorcock's great and enduring creation, are explored. In THE FIRECLOWN, a totalitarian regime is enraged by the appearance of the fireclown, a man from the lower levels of the great city whose pyroclastic displays threaten to enflame the subdued population. In THE SUNDERED WORLDS, we are introduced to the concept of the multiverse, as Count Renark von Bek seeks to save the human race from the collapse of the universe itself. And in THE TWILIGHT MAN, the last man born on earth dares to leave for the stars, in search of a cure for the malaise inflicting the remaining members of mankind.
