327676:::::Rose:::::With its striking artwork by multiple World Fantasy Award winner Charles Vess, this graphic novel prequel sets the table for Jeff Smith's continuing Bone saga. In this mini-epic, Rose (a.k.a. Gran'ma Ben) must repel a devastating dragon attack on Northern Valley villages. Resonant whether you read it as a series starter or a powerful stand-alone.
