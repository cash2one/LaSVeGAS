17318621:::::Let Him Go:::::"With you or without you," Margaret insists, and at these words George knows his only choice is to follow her. It s September 1951: years since George and Margaret Blackledge lost their son James when he was thrown from a horse; months since James s widow Lorna took off and remarried that thug Donnie Weboy. Now Margaret is steadfast, resolved to find and retrieve her grandson Jimmy the one person in this world keeping her son s memory alive while George, a retired sheriff, is none too eager to stir up trouble with Donnie Weboy. Unable to sway his wife from her mission, George takes to the road with Margaret by his side, traveling through the Dakota badlands to Bentrock, Montana, in unstoppable pursuit. When Margaret tries to convince Lorna to return home to North Dakota, bringing little Jimmy with her, the Blackledges find themselves mixed up with the entire Weboy clan, a fearsome family determined not to give the boy up without a fight. With gutsy characters and suspense-filled prose, Bring Him Back speaks to the extraordinary measures we take for family and the overpowering instinct to protect those we love. From the award-winning author who gave us Montana 1948, Justice, and American Boy , Larry Watson is at his storytelling finest in this unforgettable return to the American West.
