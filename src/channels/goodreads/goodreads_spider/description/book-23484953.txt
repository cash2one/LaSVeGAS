23484953:::::The Rocker Who Cherishes Me:::::***Mature Content. Not Intended For Readers Under The Age Of 17*** The Rocker Who Cherishes Me Wroth The marines took me from a Tennessee farm boy and turned me into a hard man. Between the things I d seen during my tour of duty and the things I d done during my years as a member of OtherWorld, nothing could faze me. Nothing. Except for HER. She s everything that is good in the world. At least, my world. Everything I ve ever done has been for her. Always for her. I feel as if I need her to breathe, to feel alive. But I can t have Marissa. She s to innocent, to damn perfect. And me? I m not good enough for that girl. She deserves better, someone who would spend their life CHERISHING her. Not breaking her heart. Marissa Between my brother and Wroth Niall I d been protected from the world for most of my life. You would think I was still a little girl the way they treated me. But I wasn t made out of glass. It would take a lot to break this girl. Because if a childhood cancer hadn t kicked my butt, nothing would. Right? Wrong. All I ve ever wanted was for him to look at me. Really look at me and see that I wasn t a fragile piece of porcelain that would break if he touched me. What I got was a lot more but nowhere close to enough. Once I touched heaven at least heaven for me and now I didn t know how to go back to what Wroth and I had had before. I can t go back to the life I was living before my short time with Wroth. It would destroy me to stay that close, when I know that I m not what he really wants. So when my brother asks me to go on tour with him yet again, I decide to jump on that tour bus without a backwards glance. Only I wasn t prepared to be stuck on HIS bus.
