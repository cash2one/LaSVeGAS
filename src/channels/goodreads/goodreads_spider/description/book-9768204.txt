9768204:::::Voyager: The Art of Pure Awareness:::::Inspired by the Upanishads sacred writings and the poetry of Zen and Taoism, Voyager is an inspirational and transformational work that conveys the ineffable truth of existence -- we are pure awareness at our centre, human in appearance. There is a light that shines beyond all things on earth, beyond the highest, the very highest heavens. This is the light that shines in your heart . --Chandogya Upanishad We are voyagers, set on a course to find our unique purpose in life. In our heart lies the key to true peace and happiness. Each of the twenty-five chapters presents a voyage toward our inner, True Self, bringing a deeper and wider perspective along the way. Exploring the shores of human-beingness ever more deeply, we realise Soul is the lighthouse -- the light that guides us safely home. By simply experiencing ourselves without distraction of mind, we see through personal drama to our inner true nature. We are all connected in the still ocean of pure awareness. It is only the mind which appears as the world and as bondage; there is no world other than the mind. On inquiry, this mind turns out to be nothing more than ripples (thoughts) in the still ocean of pure Awareness . --The Ribhu Gita Pure awareness is an art that requires practice to quiet the surface of mind and still the moving waters of our emotional seas. Awakening is recognising all world appearances are illuminated from the light that shines in our heart. We stand at the bow of our ship. The sky is clear, the sea is calm. ...Now voyager sail thou forth to seek and find . --Walt Whitman
