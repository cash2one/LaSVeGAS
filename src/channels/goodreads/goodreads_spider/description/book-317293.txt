317293:::::Playing James:::::Rules? What rules? Plucky beat reporter Holly Colshannon has a flair for the dramatic, a nose for trouble, and the remarkable ability to smile through any indignity though her latest assignment is about to test her mettle. Newly promoted to crime reporter for the Bristol Gazette, she must shadow the unsmiling (though undeniably delicious) Detective James Sabine through his action-packed days, and then capture all the danger and thrills of a cop s life in a daily column for the rag. Well, on the bright side, she gets her own byline. On the down side, delectable James is hardly overjoyed to have her around. But soon her columns are a hit with readers who can t get enough of her personal adventures riding shotgun with the sexy crime stopper. Who ever expected law and order to be so romantic? Certainly Holly s rugby-playing boyfriend and James s super-gorgeous fianc e are enough to keep any sparks of electricity in check? In the end, though, love always evens the score. . . .
