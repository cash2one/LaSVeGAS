1259288:::::Where's Nancy?:::::Where's Nancy? Nancy was going to tell you about this big mystery, but she disappeared. Poof. Just like that. So now Bess, Ned, and me, George, have the Case of the Missing Detective on our hands. We've got to find Nancy! Let me tell you, this sleuthing thing is no joke. We've worked with Nancy on lots of cases, but we've never had to do it ourselves -- and the stakes have never been so high. We think this might have to do with that possible museum theft Nancy was talking about -- we're just not sure yet. But we're woking on it. Wish us luck!
