836475:::::Girls Rule:::::This is a book for girls. For girls who are thinkers and believers. For girls who are readers and changers and dreamers. For girls who look for rainbows and friendship. For girls who are not afraid to be different. Join one such girl as she narrates this book, becomes your friend, and takes you on a journey through all the fun, craziness, and challenges of being a girl in the world. She's here with words of experience, support, advice, and a whole lot of laughs. And she's even left some space for you to write down your own thoughts, memories, wishes, and ideas. Along the path through these special pages, you'll find a shout of encouragement and a sharing of dreams for girls who know deep down that they have what it takes to achieve anything they want. You'll discover a celebration of the lives of girls--the smiley days, the dreamy days, the giggly days, the teary days, the victorious days, and even everything in between. Because every day, in a million different ways: girls rule.
