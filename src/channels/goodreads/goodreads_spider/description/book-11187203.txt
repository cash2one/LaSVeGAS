11187203:::::For the Love of a Vampire:::::Like most seventeen year olds, Ridley Heller thought she had her future all planned out. What she wanted most in life was to get out of small town Harker. Her only goal was to keep her mouth shut and her grades high so she could win a cheerleading scholarship to Stanford. But that was before she met Bo. In Ridley s wildest dreams, she could never have planned for someone like Bo, for a love so intense it left her breathless. No human girl could. A haunting stranger that watched her from afar, Bo stole Ridley s heart from the moment she laid eyes on him. But he has secrets. Bo s a vampire. Both his past and his present are a danger to Ridley, but the biggest threat is not her blood; it s her heart. He s feeding a thirst for revenge that will cost him his life, and it may already be too late. The more darkness Ridley uncovers, the more she realizes that her life will never be the same with or without Bo. Can she sacrifice her future and her heart for someone who has a death wish?
