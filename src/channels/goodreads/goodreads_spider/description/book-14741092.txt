14741092:::::Softly at Sunrise:::::Rachel Kelly has traveled a long, hard road in her journey back to her husband, Ethan, and the Kelly family. Now, as she and Ethan are poised to move into their new home, safe behind the walls of the Kelly compound, Rachel wonders if she ll finally be free of the ghosts that have haunted her for so long and if she ll step into the sun after a past steeped in darkness. I adored seeing the Kelly family do what it does best: be there for each other to support and lean on through the good and the bad.
