17404078:::::The Disaster Artist: My Life Inside The Room, the Greatest Bad Movie Ever Made:::::From the actor who lived through the most improbable Hollywood success story, with an award-winning narrative nonfiction writer, comes the inspiring, fascinating and laugh-out-loud story of a mysteriously wealthy outsider who sundered every road block in the Hollywood system to achieve success on his own terms the making of The Room , the Citizen Kane of bad movies (Entertainment Weekly). In 2003, an independent film called The Room written, produced, directed, and starring a very rich social misfit of indeterminate age and origin named Tommy Wiseau made its disastrous debut in Los Angeles. Described by one reviewer as like getting stabbed in the head, the $6 million film earned a grand total of $1,800 at the box office and closed after two weeks. Now in its tenth anniversary year, The Room is an international phenomenon to rival The Rocky Horror Picture Show . Thousands of fans wait in line for hours to attend screenings complete with costumes, audience rituals, merchandising, and thousands of plastic spoons. Readers need not have seen The Room to appreciate its costar Greg Sestero s account of how Tommy Wiseau defied every law of artistry, business, and interpersonal relationships to achieve the dream only he could love. While it does unravel mysteries for fans, The Disaster Artist is more than just an hilarious story about cinematic hubris: It is ultimately a surprisingly inspiring tour de force that reads like a page-turning novel, an open-hearted portrait of a supremely enigmatic man who will capture your heart.
