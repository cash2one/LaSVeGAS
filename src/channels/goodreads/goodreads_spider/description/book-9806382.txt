9806382:::::Hudson House:::::Hudson House . . . Teenagers Eric, Tommy, and Ed never should have entered . . . but once they did, they unleashed a power impossible to control, an evil presence intent on destroying everything they know. They are not the first to suffer in the house at the corner of Mangle Lane and Jackson Drive. Not the first to discover its unholy promise . . . or the first to know its evil . . . One will perish, one will be seduced, and one will do anything to fight back. To fight the evil that resides at Hudson House, the darkest regions of the mind and heart must be explored. But once they go down that path, there may be no way back.
