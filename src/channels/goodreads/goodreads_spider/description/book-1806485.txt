1806485:::::It Happened One Night:::::In a spellbinding tale that marks the debut of a born storyteller, a beautiful woman finds herself transported back in time. . . to a world of shimmering desire and heartrending danger. . . . Alanna Chapman knows that no accountant worth her salt would leave town during tax season, but now she has no choice. To honor her aunt's final wishes, the Colorado CPA has come to the mist-shrouded shores of Ireland, intending to stay just long enough to accomplish her mission. But on the mysterious grounds of Carraig Cor, something extraordinary happens: Alanna finds herself catapulted back to the year 1803. Taken for a "seer" who can foretell Ireland's future, she becomes the prisoner of a ruthless privateer...a dangerously attractive sea captain who has no doubt that he can bend this modern temptress to his will, to use her magic powers for his own ends. But when Alanna crossed over to the nineteenth century, she didn't leave her independent spirit behind. Now she's looking for a way to escape the captain's irresistible embrace--and his enemy's notice--before this perilous adventure costs her her heart...and her life.
