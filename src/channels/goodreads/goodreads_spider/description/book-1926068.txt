1926068:::::Forbidden:::::Claimed by the Sorcerer as his future mate, Liana is forbidden, and cannot be touched by any man. But from the moment she sees the dark stranger, Liana cannot help but fantasize about him. What his touch might feel like upon her skin, and how it would be to have him deep within her... Aric L'tiercel, King of the Nordain, is sworn to prevent Liana from mating with the Sorcerer and fulfilling a dread prophecy. While spiriting her away from the Sorcerer's grasp, he can think only about thrusting inside her, burying himself in her welcoming warmth. His desire for her transcends all reason, forcing him to choose between Liana and his people. Will Liana and Aric find a way to be together? Or will their love remain. Forbidden.
