47582:::::Soul Kitchen:::::If you can't stand the heat...Get the hell out of New Orleans! Liquor has become one of the hottest restaurants in town, thanks in part to chefs Rickey and G-man s wildly creative, booze-laced food. At the tail end of a busy Mardi Gras, Milford Goodman walks into their kitchen he s spent the last ten years in Angola Prison for murdering his boss, a wealthy New Orleans restaurateur, but has recently been exonerated on new evidence and released. Rickey remembers him as an ingenious chef and hires him on the spot. When a pill-pushing doctor and a Carnival scion talk Rickey into consulting at the restaurant they re opening in one of the city s floating casinos, Rickey recommends Milford for the head chef position and stays on to supervise. But soon Rickey finds himself medicating a kitchen injury with the doctor s wares, and G-man grows tired of holding down the fort at Liquor alone. As the new restaurant moves toward its opening, Rickey learns that Milford s past is inextricably linked with one of the project s backers, a man whose intentions begin to seem more and more sinister. Full of the flavor of one of America s greatest cities, Soul Kitchen is a sharp commentary on race relations in pre-Katrina New Orleans and a fast ride through the dark side of haute cuisine.
