12521887:::::Forgive Me, I Meant to Do It: False Apology Poems:::::This Is Just to Say If you re looking for a nice happy book put this one down and run away quickly Forgive me sweetness and good cheer are boring Inspired by William Carlos Williams s famous poem This Is Just to Say, Newbery Honor author Gail Carson Levine delivers a wickedly funny collection of her own false apology poems, imagining how tricksters really feel about the mischief they make. Matthew Cordell s clever and playful line art lightheartedly captures the spirit of the poetry. This is the perfect book for anyone who s ever apologized . . . and not really meant it.
