1107821:::::I'll Be Seeing You: A World War II Novel, Pacific Theater:::::As the Depression worsens a distant war draws near. Dan O'Brian finds he is once again embroiled with the inner conflicts he had hoped were far behind him after returning from World War I. Dan holds a strong conviction that the United States should stay out of the new war-because this time it is his son, Cory, whose life could be threatened by a foreign menace. But convictions can change. Through his work as a musician, Dan finds an unlikely new friend in Josh Brown, a man who challenges Dan's view of the world. And though both men share a common tragic link to the past, events of the future will soon forever bind the two men's families together. In an era where the future is as uncertain as it is exciting, Cory O'Brian and Nathan Brown know they must defend freedom, just as their fathers have done. What they don't yet understand are the human costs of war-to those in the battle and those at home. I'll Be Seeing You reaches beyond the battlefield, as Jerry Borrowman delivers an enthralling and beautifully detailed narrative that will touch your heart and inspire your soul.
