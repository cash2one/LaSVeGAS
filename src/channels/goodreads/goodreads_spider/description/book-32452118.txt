32452118:::::6 weeks of white castle /n rust:::::6 weeks of white castle /n rust is a collection of poems which takes the gravity of the post-industrial American Mid-West as its subject. The poems are the brutal, often humorous conjurings of a world populated by waitresses, dead-end wages and ghosts. Built from the scrap, wreckage and junk typical of places defined by their decay and abandon, DiSabatino's world of rust and rebirth carves a unique voice in new American poetry. (from the interior flap) one-size fits all: factories, gravel - beer cans, hubcaps. a limited, discount rate: lost bars, back roads, minimum-wage sex. available w/ night shifts, waitresses. down payments at 4-/n-a-quarter percent: motels, last calls, ghost stories of the living. pill bottles, parole, fast food chicken. loss, lust. ruin, rain. drive it away today: 6 weeks of white castle /n rust.
