23279048:::::MARS:::::my heart has become a planet and you are the star it has chosen to orbit. 'gravity' by Della Hicks-Wilson There is something about gravity that when you pull it just the right way, two different planets could revolve around each other. Amy, the shy girl who is still getting over her ex, tries to pull away from the blunt, over confident yet optimistic Logan, a person whom she can t seem to shake. They slowly begin to orbit each other, pulling and pushing between their clashing personalities yet similar interests. A tragedy that happens to one of them may make or break them, and the two tries to hold on as long as they could. But soon enough Amy and Logan find just the right pull to fall in love with each other, slowly, then all at once.
