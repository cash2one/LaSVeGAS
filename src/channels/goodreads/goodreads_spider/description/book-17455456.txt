17455456:::::Vampires Don't Sparkle!:::::What would you do if you had unlimited power and eternal life? Would you go back to high school? Attend the same classes year after year, going through the pomp and circumstance of one graduation after another, until you found the perfect date to take to prom? Would you spend your days moping and brooding, finding your only joy in a game of baseball on a stormy day? Or would you do something else? The authors of this collection have a few ideas; some fanciful, some humorous, and some as dark as an endless night. Join us, and discover what it truly means to be vampyre.
