34082:::::The Waste Land and Other Writings:::::Also includes Prufrock and Other Observations, Poems (1920), and The Sacred Wood Introduction by Mary Karr First published in 1922, The Waste Land, T. S. Eliot s masterpiece, is not only one of the key works of modernism but also one of the greatest poetic achievements of the twentieth century. A richly allusive pilgrimage of spiritual and psychological torment and redemption, Eliot s poem exerted a revolutionary influence on his contemporaries, summoning forth a potent new poetic language. As Kenneth Rexroth wrote, Eliot articulated the mind of an epoch in words that seemed its most natural expression. As commanding as his verse, Eliot s criticism also transformed twentieth-century letters, and this Modern Library edition includes a selection of Eliot s most important essays.
