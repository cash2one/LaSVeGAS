305858:::::Anna Karenina:::::This new translation of Tolstoy's masterpiece is the first to appear in forty years and truly a noteworthy literary event. While previous translations of Anna Karenina softened the robust, and sometimes shocking, quality of Tolstoy's voice, Richard Pevear and Larissa Volokhonsky have produced an accurate translation to allow his voice to be heard. Beautiful, vigorous, and eminently readable, this award-winning team's translation of Anna Karenina will immediately supersede all other English versions.Regarded by many as the greatest novel ever written in any language, Anna Karenina relates the doomed love affair between the sensuous and rebellious Anna and the dashing officer Count Vronsky. Set against a vast and richly textured canvas of nineteenth-century Russia, Anna's tragedy unfolds with relentless force as she rejects her passionless marriage to the aging official Karenin and must endure the hypocrisies of society. This authoritative edition of Anna Karenina includes an illuminating introduction and careful explanatory notes compiled by the translators.
