18807831:::::Taut: The Ford Book:::::Ford Aston is known for many things. Being an emotionless, messed up bastard, a freakishly smart social outcast, and a cold, domineering master who keeps "pets" instead of girlfriends. And after Rook broke his heart, he plans to keep it that way. Ashleigh is known for nothing, and that's exactly what she's got going for her. She's broke, stranded in the mountains with a three month old baby, and Ford Aston is screwing with her head. Big. Time. And she plans to mess with his right back. It's a coy game at first, filled with flirting, and innuendo--but Ford soon realizes something is not quite right with Ashleigh. In fact, something is seriously, seriously wrong and the closer they get to their final destination, the closer Ford gets to the truth. One night of devastation, self-loathing, and emptiness turns into the best thing that ever happened to Ford Aston. But one day of in-your-face reality threatens Ashleigh's whole existence. Ford first appears in Rook and Ronin #2, Manic. He has a bigger role in Panic, R&amp;R #3, and then he has a novella, called SLACK. This TAUT book is only FORD. It's not really part of the R&amp;R series, as that plot has all been sidelined for this one romance book.
