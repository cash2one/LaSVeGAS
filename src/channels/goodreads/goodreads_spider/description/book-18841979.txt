18841979:::::Flatland: A Romance of Many Dimensions:::::A classic of scientific and mathematical fiction, Flatland is the story of a Square as he journeys through new dimensions. He experiences Spaceland (a universe with three dimensions), Lineland (a universe of one dimension), and Pointland ( a universe no dimensions). This work of literature looks at the world through a purely mathematical lens to help us better understand the concepts of dimension as well as the sociological implications of hierarchies. Finally, the Square dares to dream of a land with four dimensions, an incredible idea which gets him banished from Spaceland.
