17727206:::::Corroded:::::Hungry for vengeance, Cherry St. Croix is forced to the fog-ridden streets of Victorian London. My rival, a collector of bounties like myself, has murdered one of my own. In consequence, I have been removed from my house, my staff, and all who would support me. I have nowhere else to turn, so I beg asylum within the Midnight Menagerie, London s decadent pleasure garden. Micajah Hawke s dominance there will not tolerate my presence for long. I am fixated on revenge, but I walk a razor s edge under his scrutiny His wicked power is not easily ignored, and I must not allow myself to submit no matter how sweet the sacrifice. Challenging my rival to a race is the only way to end this, no small task when the quarry is the murderous Jack the Ripper. As my enemies close in, I fear the consequences of this hunt. I am trapped between two killers, and what doesn t kill me may leave its scars forever.
