1919486:::::The Goddesses: Portraits by Madame Yevonde:::::Madame Yevonde was an esteemed portrait photographer who, in the mid 1930s, made portraits of society women in the guise of various ancient heroines--principally goddesses. She was a pioneer in color photography, utilizing the Vivex tri-color process which gave a memorable artificiality to the photographs. All 22 portraits are reproduced in our book through the cooperation of The Yevonde Portrait Archives. Lawrence Hole, of the Archive, contributes a preface which sheds new light on the portraits. Welleran Poltarnees, in his foreward, speculates on the power of this remarkable series.
