16077527:::::The Pretend Boyfriend:::::Samantha Fox is awkward, clumsy and totally in need of a new boyfriend by this weekend. Her younger, prettier sister is getting engaged . . . and all set to make old maid big sister Sam feel all crummy and shelved. Enter Brian Morton. He is bewilderingly gorgeous, fantastically rich, razor-tongued snarky and utterly promiscuous. He was also the bully who made Sam s middle school life a living hell. A series of bizarre circumstances culminates in Brian losing a bet. His punishment? To be Sam s slave for the weekend . . . and to do anything she wants. Sam has just found her pretend boyfriend for her sister s party. And Brian has just found that the woman he used to call Jaws in school (for her braces) packs a helluva bite.
