545421:::::Narrow Rooms:::::A powerful story of love turned round, of passion and fierce discovery, of lives illuminated by flickering violence. As Purdy spins the story of the extraordinary symbiotic relationship between four boys in a remote West Virginia mountain town, led by the seemingly hypnotic power of the one known as "the renderer," the prose itself is rendered by Purdy into spare, ecstatic brilliance, and Narrow Rooms takes on the resonance of any time, any place, of haunted myth, of a tale of horror told in the darkness by generations, and never, never to be forgotten... From the first-edition dust jacket.
