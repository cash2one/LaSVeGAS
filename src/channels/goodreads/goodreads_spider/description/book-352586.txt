352586:::::The Sinful Nights of a Nobleman:::::Award-winning author Jillian Hunter pens another deliciously sexy tale of passionate romance and beguiling trickery. At a glamorous soiree in the romantic English countryside, Lord Devon Boscastle, one of the most elusive bachelors in London, is on the prowl for a willing and wicked lady to share a night of all-consuming sin. So he's delighted to accept a mysterious invitation for a midnight rendezvous. Miss Jocelyn Lydbury, a demure young debutante, has her heart set on a marriage proposal from a certain respectable gentleman. Invited to a secret tryst at the stroke of twelve, she hopes to finally meet her longtime admirer. To her dismay, it is the heartbreaking Devon who lies in wait for his midnight lady. Before the pair can unmask their deceiver, they are caught in a passionate, if unplanned, embrace and forced into marriage. Although Devon claims he won't change his roguish ways for anyone, upon returning to London he is surprised to find that his once-timid bride has become an alluring temptress. But little does he know that Jocelyn has vowed to tame her handsome rake-in the ballroom and in the bedchamber.
