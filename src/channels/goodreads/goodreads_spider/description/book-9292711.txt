9292711:::::What Nathan Wants:::::What could a man who already has everything possibly want? How about a baby? Someone to carry on his business when he dies? But to have the baby, he needs a wife. This is why Nathan Rudolph interviews all the single women in his company. They think they might get a job promotion, but he comes with a marriage license instead. And the winner isn't happy. But he's dealt with difficult people before and is certain that, in no time at all, Amy Watson will be very happy to be Mrs. Nathan Rudolph...as long as he seduces her right. *These are the books in the Omaha Contemporary Romances Series: Book 1: With This Ring I Thee Dread Book 2: What Nathan Wants Book 3: Just Good Friends
