20646451:::::Mercy's Pen:::::What happens when you re not who you think you are? A child s question, Cat s revelations, a confession, and an accident in the Maine woods bring David, Debbie and their extended family to the Maine seacoast on a journey through the past to their future. Note from Glori: Attention All Readers: Mercy s Pen contains Christian content (Yeah, Cat s seriously unleashed here.) and Strong Language (There are certain secret agents that need their mouths washed out with soap. Okay, I m no angel either.) that may not be appropriate for all readers. I think you ll want to know what happens with us. After all, you ve read Book #4. There s bound to be a little redemption involved. The Redemption Series should be read in order: Book One: KILLER CUPID Book Two: FAME, FORTUNE &amp; SECRETS Book Three: IN THE NAME OF GLORI Book Four: LAST TANGLE IN PARIS Book Five: MERCY S PEN
