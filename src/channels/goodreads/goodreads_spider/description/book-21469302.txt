21469302:::::Love... From Both Sides:::::'I haven't giggled so much in ages. I sailed through it, only occasionally having to put it down to wipe the tears of mirth from my cheeks.' Daily Mail 'Clevery constructed and downright hilarious.' Closer When Nick Spalding self-published Love... From Both Sides and Love... And Sleepless Nights he became one of the bestselling ebook authors of 2012. Now for the first time the Love... books are being published in a longer format with more of the love story, more of Laura and Jamie's ups and downs and more of the laugh-out-loud hilarious moments that fans have come to know and love. Sometimes, the hardest part of finding love is keeping a straight face... For Jamie Newman, being a single guy isn't proving to be much fun, especially when confronted with a sexually belligerent divorcee and a goddess so far out of his league she might as well be a different species. Mind you, being a girl in search of love isn't a bowl of cherries either. Just ask Laura McIntyre, who's recently contended with a horny estate agent on a quest for light relief and a rabid mountain bike enthusiast with a penchant for lycra that leaves little to the imagination. When Jamie and Laura bump into one another (quite literally) it looks like their luck may have changed - but sometimes finding the right person is only the start of your problems... Love... From Both Sides is a warts-and-all romantic comedy for everyone who knows how tricky the quest for love can be.
