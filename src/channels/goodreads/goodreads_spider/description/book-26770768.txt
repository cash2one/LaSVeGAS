26770768:::::Falling Star:::::I met Byron when I was 10 years old. Even then I knew he was special; he was a shining star in our small town. Now it is our Senior year of high school and he is slipping from my grasp. He never smiles anymore. I think he is depressed, but how do you bring that up to someone? He knows that I love him. If only he would let me in. I hope he asks for help soon... Falling Star is based on true events that happened in the author's life, and is written to bring more awareness to teen depression. It is a young adult novel about finding yourself that is filled with love, friendship, and heartbreak. H.B. Catherine is also currently running the #EMBRACEYOURSELF campaign where all proceeds go to a foundation for helping with depression and suicidal thoughts. www.hbcatherinewriting.com
