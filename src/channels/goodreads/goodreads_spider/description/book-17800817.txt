Isabelle,"Izzy", is a barely noticeable artist, whose home life is less than to be desired. She feels completely alone in the world, that is until the fateful day when Jeremy saves her from school tormentors and changes both their lives forever. Isabelle cannot believe her good fortune when Jeremy forms a friendship with her because nothing goes her way. After all, she is blatantly tormented by her peers, ignored by her school crush, has never been kissed, and her mother is an alcoholic. How could she ever have a relationship, even a friendship, with anyone, let alone someone so good looking and altruistic? Though, it's not all good looks, good deeds and fast cars for Jeremy, whose past still haunts him. Can a horrific event that forces Isabelle out of her home and into Jeremy's spare bedroom teach these two how to live and love?
