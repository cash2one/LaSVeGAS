22925759:::::Keela:::::Keela Daley is stressed out with nightmares and memories from her past, they are haunting her. She has no time to dwell on them as she is moving out of her dog box sized apartment and into her first house with her fianc . Moving house is a dreaded task, and Keela would love nothing more than for things to go quietly and smoothly, but when you re engaged to a Slater brother, nothing goes quietly or smoothly. Nothing . Alec Slater loves his woman. He also loves playing games and surprising her. Picking moving day to do both, turns out to be a failure of epic proportions. Alec wants to make it up to Keela for his mistakes, but as the day goes on, and things go from bad to worse, he doesn t know if living with him is something she wants anymore. What started out as a simple day of packing and moving house turns into the day from Hell. Unwanted house guests. Business propositions. Alcohol. Pregnancy tests. Panic attacks. Fighting. Arguing. Sex, and everything else that is crazy and represents the name Slater. Keela has a choice to make, and not one she will make lightly. Keela adores Alec, and what Keela adores, Keela cherishes.
