6356101:::::The Songs and Sonets of John Donne:::::There is perhaps no superior edition of Donne's Songs and Sonets than Theodore Redpath's wonderful annotated volume. Out of print for a decade, the book is reprinted here in its second, revised edition. The book's twofold origin is evident on every page of Redpath's limpid commentary: it arises partly out of a life of scholarship and partly from Redpath's experiences and concerns as a teacher. The volume contains notes "on every point likely to cause difficulty to a reader of average intelligence."
