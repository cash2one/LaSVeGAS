35150206:::::Sweet Disaster:::::Kady: My life is a complete and utter disaster. One major screw up after another. In other words - I m trouble. I attempted college, but made a mess of that scene, too. Chalk it up to yet another disappointment in my parents ever-growing list of Kady failures. Deciding I needed an escape from reality, my best friend and I flew off to Europe, where we were going to have the time of our lives. The only problem with that plan is that I ran out of money after two weeks, and now I m stuck in Florence, Italy with no means of getting home. See? Trouble finds me wherever I go. Gavin: All I ever wanted to do was play basketball. It s all I m good at. I bypassed college and went straight to the pros. I ve been playing overseas in Italy for six months, gaining fame, fans and having fun. There s only one problem. I miss home. I m not too big to admit I m homesick for my family and friends. But that all changed when I heard from Cade Griffin, a former college hoops star. He called and asked me to rescue his sister, Kadence, who s stranded and alone here in Florence. Seems easy enough, right? Except for the fact that Kady Griffin is gorgeous, completely off-limits and a sweet disaster waiting to happen all over my life. ***SWEET DISASTER is a standalone novel and the fourth in The Sweetest Thing series.
