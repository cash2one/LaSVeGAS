He was surviving alone, outside the war, until he happened to win a cake at the f te. From that moment, he is ruthlessly hunted by Nazi agents and finds himself the prey of malign and shadowy forces. "A master thriller and a remarkable portrait of a twisted character." Time This Penguin Classics edition features an introduction by Alan Furst.
