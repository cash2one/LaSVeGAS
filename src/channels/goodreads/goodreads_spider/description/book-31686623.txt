31686623:::::Switch:::::*An Amazon Top 10 Bestseller* Mallory Sims is late for her first day of work. After spilling her tea, she discovers she has no gas in her car. Add that her arm keeps sticking to her dress from syrup left on the console of her car, flustered feels like an understatement. Then she sees her new boss. Graham Landry is the epitome of NSFW in his custom-fit suit, black-rimmed glasses, and a look so stern her libido doesn t stand a chance. Being flustered is just the start of her problems. Her punctuality is only the start of his. With a pink slip in hand, he s been waiting on his new secretary to show up only to let her go. Then she rushes in with her doe eyes and rambling excuses, smelling like bacon and lavender. The termination paper falls to the side as she falls in his arms. This is a disaster in the making. Not because of his pinpoint exactness or her free spirit, but because when they re together, the sparks that fly threaten to burn the whole place down.
