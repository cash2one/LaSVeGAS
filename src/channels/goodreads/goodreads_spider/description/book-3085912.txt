3085912:::::Best Laid Plans:::::Best Laid Plans was my first woman's fiction novel! I was so excited when I was able to get my rights back and claim it as my own! Take a trip back to 1983. There was no TSA and people smoked on airplanes. (The airplane scene actually happened to me and the nun!) This was New Orleans before Hurricane Katrina a place I fell in love with and visited a half-dozen times. Alas, some of the restaurants I knew are no longer in business and menu prices certainly have changed. Fashion is still fashion! The styles come and go, but somehow are reborn again and again. While it was a sensuous romance when it was first published, it was fun to amp things up! Meet Amanda Wyatt she had an eight year plan and accomplished so much more. Attractive, talented, she was a success whether she was designing high fashion or running her own elegant shop in New Orleans. And she had a friend with benefits relationship with Lucas Crosse, her lawyer and the brother she never had for twelve years. He knew her intimately - well almost.
