11415233:::::Damascus Road:::::(Damascus Road is Book Two of the Corescu Chronicles) How far would you go to protect the innocent? Giving up your life to save a stranger is one thing, but subject yourself to constant torture in an effort to save some people you've never met? This is the kind of man you'll find in Tony Agricola; survivor of Book One: The Judging. Tony will sacrifice his very blood so the town can sleep safe at night. Would you? Book Jacket Copy: Tony Agricola is on a mission: pursue and attempt to redeem the newly-turned and ravenous vampire, Paul Black. But how do you subdue a creature a hundred times stronger than you or save one who is more than determined to remain as he is? With the help of new friend and part-time preacher, Big John Jenkins, Tony is able to convince Paul to concentrate his bloodlust on the two of them alone, leaving the rest of the population safe from his deadly kiss. But at what cost? Behaving is not one of Paul's strong points. In danger at every turn of the vampire's whimsy, and dodging two indomitable police detectives on their trail, Tony valiantly drags Paul to Germany to confront his master, Doctor Mark Corescu, who fled humanity after the events of Book One. Before the dust settles, Hope Brannen, madly in love with the doctor, arrives and puts her fists in the fight. Vacillating between the desire to be good and the lust for blood, Mark, Paul, and Tony wrestle to the end, making the final result anybody's game.
