10592058:::::Wiccan:::::Where does evil live? Is it in the heart? Or in the blood? Nearly-nineteen year old Mercy Holloway has a gift. Long ago murders play out right before her eyes when she passes over a place of death, but Mercy never thought that her unusual ability would interfere with her having a normal college experience. Until today, that is. On her way to school, Mercy witnesses another murder--only this one's different. And Mercy's the only one who can do anything about it. Out of time and out of options, Mercy takes what little information she has to the police where she meets Detective Caleb Grayson. Grayson doesn't necessarily believe Mercy, he's just better at hiding his feelings than most. It's not long, however, before Grayson has no choice but to believe her. As the two embark on a mission to solve a murder, Mercy starts having more visions. Only these contain messages. And they're meant for her. This powerful, evil killer knows things about Mercy that she didn't even know herself, things she never wanted to find out. Body by body, Mercy discovers that her gift is not a gift at all, but a curse. And it's one she can't escape. It runs in her veins. Can Mercy and Grayson catch a killer and capture love? Or are they destined to fail...at both? Book 1- Wiccan Book 2- Wiccan Born, Coming Soon About Michelle: I love coffee and chocolate, even more so when they are combined. I'm convinced that one day they could be the basis for world peace. I also love the color red and am seriously considering dying my hair.
