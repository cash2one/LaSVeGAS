16059709:::::How Hard Can It Be?:::::HOW HARD CAN IT BE? One happy ending coming right up ************************************************* What happens when an accountant decides to grab life by the horns and try something new? Apparently a pirate named Dave, a lot of pastel fleece, and blackmail just to start with Visualize and succeed, Oprah said. I was sure as hell trying, even if my campaign to score a job as the local weather girl had ended in a restraining order. Okay, TV was not my strength. But a lack of talent has never stopped me before. Which is why I ve embarked on a writing career. I mean, how hard can it be to come up with a sexy romance? Leave it to me to wind up in a group of grandmotherly porno writers who discuss sex toys and apple cobbler in the same breath. Also leave it to me to leak an outlandish plot idea to a bestselling author with the morals of a rabid squirrel. And only I could get arrested for a jewelry heist I didn t commit by a hunky cop whose handcuffs just might tempt me to sign up for a life of crime. Maybe I ve found my calling after all
