13497161:::::Illumination Idyllic Comfort To Opt:::::Poetry of the soil and the depths of the living. A reflection of truth, comfort and views, mirrors of choices with a single voice to opt. Life over lies, kisses and visions from eyes. The brightness of emotions and wisdom to speak through, the changes of soothing comfort.
