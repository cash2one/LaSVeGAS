7841512:::::To Fetch a Thief:::::In this third book in the brilliant mystery series, Chet and Bernie go under the big top to solve the most unlikely missing persons (and animals!) case ever. Chet has smelled a lot of unusual things in his years as trusted companion and partner to P.I. Bernie Little, but nothing has prepared him for the exotic scents he encounters when an old-fashioned traveling circus comes to town. Bernie scores tickets because his son is crazy about elephants. The only problem is that Peanut, the headlining pachyderm, has gone missing along with her trainer. Stranger still, no one saw them leave. How does an elephant vanish without a trace?
