What People are saying about Bob Moore "The most delicious "superhero" themed book I've read. The world is incredibly deep, believable, and realistic with its own rules and terminology. The characters come alive and make you feel." -Vitaly Alexius, Creator Romantically Apocalyptic "This was quite an enjoyable read. When you cross a gritty gumshoe with spandex superheros, their two worlds collide in spectacular fashion." -Jeffrey Hendricks, Author Seeking the Heavens "The book is fast and keeps your interest. This was the first book that as I approached the end, I started getting a feeling of dread that the end was coming up and at the same time I had to find out the finale. What an enjoyable sensation." -Greg Rose
