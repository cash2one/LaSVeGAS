Once done, they'll return home and the future will be as it should be. But Kallen didn't plan on meeting Aaric Utzman, a young cartographer from post-colonial America. Nor did he plan to fall in love with him. He must find a way for them to stay together or Aaric will have been dead for over six hundred years after Kallen's return. No matter what he decides, the past, the present, and the future will be irrevocably altered."
