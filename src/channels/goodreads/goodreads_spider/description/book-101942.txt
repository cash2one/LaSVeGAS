101942:::::The Tripods Trilogy:::::Long ago the Tripods, gigantic three-legged machines, descended upon Earth and took control. They used "Caps," administered ceremoniously near each child's 14th birthday, to control humans' brains and keep them docile. Now there is pleasant life in villages, little technology, and no war--but there is no freedom either. In this powerful and suspenseful series, 13-year-old Will Parker and his friends deal with hunger, humanity, envy, and pride as they struggle to find out all they can about the Tripods and overthrow their rule. Written by John Christopher, author of many juvenile science fiction and fantasy books, The Tripods Trilogy is sure to make a science fiction fan out of any reader--young or old. This box set of paperbacks includes The White Mountains, The City of Gold and Lead, and The Pool of Fire, the chilling conclusion to the series that poses the question: Who would rule the world if it were freed from the aliens?
