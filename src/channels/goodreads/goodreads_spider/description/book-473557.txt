473557:::::The Journal of Albion Moonlight:::::Kenneth Patchen sets off on an allegorical journey of his own in which the far boundaries of love and murder, madness and sex are sensually explored. His is the tale of a disordered pilgrimage to H. Roivas (Heavenly Savior) in which the deranged responses of individuals point up the outer madness from which they derive in a more imaginative way that social protest generally allows. Like Camus, Kenneth Patchen is anti-cool, anti-hip, anti-beat.
