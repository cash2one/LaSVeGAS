18754418:::::Forbidden Desire:::::Savanna felt the cold autumn air touching her lips ,through reality and fantasy in ages long before her time in this land far from home among endless mountain peeks.Right here she could dance naked against the ruin walls that took control of her soul.It was here she found Nikolas ,with eyes like midnight and hair dark as raven feathers ,her immortal love.From the moment he laid eyes upon her ,he wanted her as his goddess he had search for his existence.In one breath ,he seduced her mind ,but no one knew Nikolas until the truth came out.
