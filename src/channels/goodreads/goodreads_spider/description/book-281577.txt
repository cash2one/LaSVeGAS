281577:::::The Nannies:::::Good girls. Life in La Crosse couldn t be any blah-er. Kiley s way out? A pricey school in California that she can only afford if she s a resident of the Golden State. That s why she s on Platinum Nanny , vying for the chance to work for a wacko rock star or be sent home nationally humiliated. Wild girls. Lydia has spent eight years stuck in the Amazon with her do-gooding parents. When her aunt offers her a lifeline babysitting in posh Bel Air Lydia hops the next plane to civilization. Pucci sandals, poolside cabanas, clubbing in Hollywood It spots was there even a question she d accept? Now she just has to find a cute pool boy to make up for all that lost time. . . . Wilder boys. Moving into the guesthouse of one of Beverly Hills most powerful families isn t exactly what Esme had in mind for a summer job. Neither was losing her head over Jonathan, her new boss s almost famous (and already hot) son. Safe to say her boyfriend isn t going to like this. Grab your sunglasses and welcome to The Nannies , a crazy world of Hollyweird backstabbing and skyscraping palm trees, spoiled tots and private swim lessons. But how hard can a nanny job be? After all, eight to four is kid time. After that? It s our time.
