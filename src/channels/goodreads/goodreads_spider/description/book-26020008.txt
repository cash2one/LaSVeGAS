26020008:::::Conflict of Interest:::::Ambitious and insightful, Gabby DiVirgilio only has one thing standing in the way of her climbing the corporate ladder: her new business partner, Lucas McCarthy. He's arrogant and dismissive, driving her mad with his sexy Irish accent in every possible way. Recently promoted to the executive ranks, Lucas must prove that he s the right man for the job. He never expected that the HR professional he d be forced to work with on a daily basis would be gorgeous, challenging and smart as hell. He s not the type to accept help from anyone, especially not a bubbly, policy-enforcer that he d rather bend over his desk. Never one to lose focus, Lucas avoids Gabby at all costs until circumventing her becomes career suicide. Fraternizing in the workplace is strictly prohibited and neither one of them are willing to break the rules. But with their undeniable chemistry about to ignite, Lucas and Gabby must decide which consequence is worse combusting from sexual frustration or violating company policy.
