13594805:::::The Grapes of Wrath:::::Alternate Cover Edition for ISBN: 0 1400 4239 3 When John Steinbecks's The Grapes of Wrath first appeared in 1939, it electified an America still convalescing from the depression. Particularized in the story of the Koad family, the movel is not only a powerful dramatization of the forced migration of the "Okies" from their bank-foreclesed fields and forams; it is a dramatization as well of the plight of the dispossessed everywhere. Written out of passionate conviction by a master storyteller, The Grapes of Wrath is both a great social document of an era and a milestone in American fiction. Those who have read it before will find a new impact in the rereading of it, and those of a later generation who come to it for the first time will have the shock of a major literary discovery.
