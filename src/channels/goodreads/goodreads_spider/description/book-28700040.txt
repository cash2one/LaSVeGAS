28700040:::::Me: An Exaggerated Autobiography:::::I'm not a fan of spoilers, or going into so much detail that the surprises are lessened, so I don't know what to say here. I can give you the first paragraph, which doubles as the back cover, and I suppose I can say that I think my story feels like a Doctor Who series, but it's not and should in no way be taken as such, because it's just ME. But if you like Time Travel, paradoxical occurrences that are confusing, 90's memories..., wizard-like abilities, and questionable sanity in an Author, then my books for you. Oh, also... alternate timelines, esp, astral projection, cheesy conversation, confusion inducers, bent reality, nostalgia, timey wimey talk, and fast analytical ramblings... etc. Hope you love "ME" ... and chose to tell others to check "ME" out. And here's that excerpt: ... My heart stopped. For approximately 30 minutes I ceased to live before I even began life. Miraculously, the doctors were able to restart my heart, bringing me back to the living, so that I could live a normal life. Everyone became hysterical, thinking their baby would never breathe a breath. If only they knew their baby would live more than most people could ever live... That was only the beginning... The adventure begins at birth, but will end beyond one's imagination.
