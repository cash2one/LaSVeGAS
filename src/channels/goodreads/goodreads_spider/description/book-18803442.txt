18803442:::::Against All Odds:::::Our lives shattered... Our hearts broken... Our souls torn to pieces... He was my world, my whole life. My reason for breathing. I had a perfect marriage, a baby on the way, and I felt fulfilled almost invincible. Until the day life hit, leaving me broken, vulnerable, and alone. She was my life. My ray of hope on the cloudiest day. With her, I thought I had the ultimate safety. A love that would never hurt or betray me. I gave her my heart, my body, and my soul. Until she broke me, destroying every dream and illusion I had about life, love, and marriage. In our grief, we made a mistake. A mistake I'm not sure we can come back from.
