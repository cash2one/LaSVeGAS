8642235:::::Krazy Kat: A Celebration of Sundays:::::In 2005, years ago, Sunday Press created a new standard for comic strip reprints with it's publication of "Little Nemo in Slumberland, So Many Splendid Sundays." Now it's been hundred years since Ignatz Mouse first tossed a brick at Krazy Kat, and to commemorate the occasion, Sunday Press Books presents Sunday comics from the genius of George Herriman; over 150 of the best Sunday pages reprinted for the first time in their original size and colors. This hand-bound volume features his greatest Krazy Kat Sunday comics, from the first B&amp;W (1916) to the last color Sunday (1944). Also included is a sample of all of Herriman's creations for the Sunday comics from 1901 -1906, most of which have never been reprinted before, with contributions by Michael Tisserand and Art Spiegelman. As co-editor Patrick McDonnell states in the introduction; "All great art is timeless. It's made with presence and stays in the present. George Herriman's Krazy Kat doesn't age it just is."
