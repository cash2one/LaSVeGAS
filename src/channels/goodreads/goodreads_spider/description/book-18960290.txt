18960290:::::Locomotives in Winter:::::Hunter, a high school senior, finds himself with no place to go and ends up sharing a bed with the friend and classmate he once had abandoned. Brandon, who has been in love with Hunter since ninth grade, finds having Hunter in his bed every night leads to some surprises. After graduating, the two boys part. Years later Brandon receives an unexpected call from Hunter, who has been married twice and has a son. Now, he's come to realize Brandon was always the love of his life. Hartwell charts the lives of not only Brandon and Hunter but their friends Case, Jorge, and Scott, as well. Readers also come to know Hunter's son, Ben, and Case's son, Taylor, who are best friends. Locomotives in Winter is an intimate, sexy novel as well as an oddly-literate novel --with its title taken from a Whitman poem--for readers looking to read something a bit out of the ordinary.
