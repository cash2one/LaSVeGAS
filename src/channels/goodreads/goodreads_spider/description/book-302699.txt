302699:::::Brat Pack:::::Rick Veitch's fierce and darkly comic BRATPACK has long been considered a subterranean classic of the genre. Now, at last, the notorious graphic novel that made the mainstream safe for totally twisted superhero satires is available in a new KING HELL trade paperback edition! Veitch's no-holds-barred dissection of the hoary old 'kid sidekick' phenomena is as harrowing as it is hilarious; subversively subtle yet completely over the top. BRATPACK is an edgy and unforgettable dance macabre that is a must for every graphic novel collection. With an introduction by Neil Gaiman. BRATPACK is a companion volume to Rick Veitch's THE MAXIMORTAL and was nominated for "Best Graphic Album" in the Eisner Awards in 1995.
