253772:::::Ordering Your Private World:::::We have schedule planners, computerized calendars,and self-stick notes to help us organize our business and social lives everyday. But what about organizing the other side of our lives the spiritual side? One of the great battlegrounds of the new century is within the private world of the individual.The values of our Western culture incline us to believe that the busy, publicly active person in ministry is also the most spiritual. Tempted to give imbalanced attention to the public world at the expense of the private, we become involved in more programs, more meetings.

In this timely update of his classic Ordering Your Private World , Gordon MacDonald equips a new generation to live life from the inside out, cultivating the inner victory necessary for public effectiveness.
