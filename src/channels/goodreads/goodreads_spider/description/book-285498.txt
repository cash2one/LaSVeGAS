285498:::::Lives of the Signers of the Declaration of Independence:::::While most children grasp the importance of America's Declaration of Independence, few experience the lives of its multifarious signatories. Few read of the trials &amp; tribulations of those who risked their "lives, fortunes &amp; sacred honor" for the liberty we dearly cherish. LIVES OF THE SIGNERS OF THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE, originally published in 1848, provides a brief biography of each of these men. These biographies, accompanied by fifty engravings, illuminate "the chief events in the lives of the men who stood sponsors at the baptism of blood of our infant republic." Children will rediscover the private &amp; public virtues of America's most venerated fathers; they will relive the creation of the most stable &amp; enviable nation in the world. LIVES OF THE SIGNERS also offers an instructive survey of the causes of Independence, simplifying the Declaration with discussion &amp; analysis for each grievance. An excellent tool for the promising young scholar, &amp; a worthy addition to any library.
