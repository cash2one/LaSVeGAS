11607961:::::Never Say Genius:::::Today is Coke and Pepsi McDonald's thirteenth birthday. Someone's out to make sure they never make it to thirteen and a half. Racing across America, the twins will nearly be BOILED ALIVE in a huge basket of french fries, FROZEN TO DEATH by soft-serve ice cream, STAMPEDED in a wild stadium riot, KIDNAPPED from a high-speed roller coaster, and WORST OF ALL their parents think they're totally joking! Will they survive? Will they defeat Archie Clone? Will they be dropped out of a helicopter onto the tip of the Washington Monument? Will they ever say "genius"?
