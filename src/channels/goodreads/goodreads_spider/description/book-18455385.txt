18455385:::::Love... And Sleepless Nights:::::Falling in love is easy... ... starting a family is far from it. Just ask Jamie and Laura Newman, who (thanks to a rather relaxed attitude to contraception) find themselves about to have a baby. It s obviously a terrifying prospect for a newly married couple, but as long as they stick together they ll be fine, right? They d better, because the path between conception and those first few baby steps is littered with many obstacles such as public sickness, rabid insomnia, violent mood swings, complicated sex, and copious amounts of swearing. Featuring a cast that includes an overbearing mother-in-law, a terrifying midwife, and at least one chorus of mating humpbacks, Love And Sleepless Nights is the hilarious sequel all about what happens next... Falling in love with another person is easy. Making a new one with them is where things get complicated.
