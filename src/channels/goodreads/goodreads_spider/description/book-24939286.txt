24939286:::::Dark Strands: Stirrings beneath the surface:::::There is beauty in darkness. Dark Strands is a collection of poetry by JD Estrada where the more shadowy aspects of humanity are explored. As humans, there are many sides to us and some of them aren t so pretty. Still, the statement "life is beautiful" is true, even in the not so lovely parts. Anger, sadness, despair, and madness can all have their moment to shine because they can all happen. Experiencing any of these emotions is human so why not enjoy them in verse as well. Care to come in and enjoy a slice of the dark? Don t worry, the worst that can happen is that you enjoy it.
