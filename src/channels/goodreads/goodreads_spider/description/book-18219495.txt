18219495:::::The Grace in Darkness:::::Every part of me yearns for Ryland and there hasn t been a day that s gone by that I don t question if I made the right decision. Adjusting is something I should be used to by now but how can I do that when life has other plans? When darkness consumes you, only true light can free you Remembering how I existed before Araya came into my life and turned everything upside down has been the hardest thing I ve ever had to do. I can t stand to be round anyone and the feeling is mutual. But I m ready to take back what s mine. I m ready to be whole again. But every decision has a choice and every choice has a consequence. To find the grace in darkness, you must Dare to be BRAVE Dare to be STRONG Dare to be ALIVE
