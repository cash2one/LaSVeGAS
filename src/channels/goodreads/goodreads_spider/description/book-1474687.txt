1474687:::::The Little Book of Demons: The Positive Advantages of the Personification of Life's Problems:::::In his own inimitable style Ramsey Dukes takes us through the advantages and dangers of hobnobbing with Demons. However for him Demons are very much our own creations; lifes problems and challenges personified and given form. We can either be their slaves or strike bargains and get back into the driving seat. With his characteristic wit and wisdom, Uncle Ramsey takes us on a rollercoaster ride through our own subconscious in a sustained effort for us to accept and negotiate with lifes challenges.
