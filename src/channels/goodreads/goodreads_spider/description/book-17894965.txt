17894965:::::Legacy: Awakenings:::::What would you do? You live in small town U.S.A. You're a typical teenager. You just have to make it through each day without horribly embarrassing yourself. You have a normal, uneventful life. You're part of a wonderful, supportive family. Sure, your mother has the power to heal with her hands. But everyone has secrets, right? What would you do? You find out that you have a special power as well. That doesn't make you a freak, right? It's just one more thing you have to incorporate into your life. You just have to keep it hidden, no big deal. What would you do? Your world is about to come crashing down upon you. Just when you think you have a good bead on things. But as many of us already know, life rarely goes according to plan. What would you do?
