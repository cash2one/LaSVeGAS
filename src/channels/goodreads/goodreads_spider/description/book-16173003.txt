16173003:::::Kids We Were:::::This anthology of childhood memories was furnished by family and friends from all walks of life and drawn from a wide range of people. All the stories are true, as far as memory allows, and the contributors are real people whose ages range from 16 to 87. The individuals concerned were born in the 20th century. I interviewed each person and edited the stories and recollections. In some instances, where I have received verbal recall, I have excluded much of the strong language. In other instances, where such expression is milder, I have included it to maintain the voice and flow of the storytelling process. This is not a children s book, although older children may find it rewarding to discover the childhoods of their parents, grandparents and even great-grandparents. These were childhoods enriched through street games and songs and all manner of simple entertainment long before the arrival of cellphones and home computers.
