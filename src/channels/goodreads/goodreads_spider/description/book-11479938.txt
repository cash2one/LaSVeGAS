11479938:::::Boyfriend From Hell:::::Fifteen year-old Megan Barnett and her single mom, Suze, have a special relationship-they are friends, close friends, who do almost everything together. "But come on, guys, she's my mother... Can I really tell her that while we're snuggled up on the sofa watching Spider Man Three, I'm secretly undressing James Franco with my eyes? Of course not..." The special bond takes a turn for the worse when Suze decides to start dating again. She hasn't had a man in her life since Megan's father left ten years ago. Enter two mysterious young men, Megan's new classmate, sinfully attractive bad boy, Guy Matson, and the dangerously handsome art dealer, Armando. Before long Megan and Suze both wind up in steamy relationships. But neither of the handsome pair is quite what he seems. In fact, one of them is Satan, with his sights set on a new bride. Megan has precious little time to figure out how to stop him. If she doesn't, either Megan or Suze are quite literally going to HELL. "Boyfriend From Hell" is the first book in the Falling Angels Saga from the author of the gruesomely hilarious, "Never Slow Dance With A Zombie."
