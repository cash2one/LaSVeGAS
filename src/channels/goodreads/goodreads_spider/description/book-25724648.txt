25724648:::::Home: A Hidden Tale - Sinister Tales:::::I am Maria. My only desire in this world is to have a real family, to have a mother and father that I could call my own. So why did I kill the people who gave me home? They did nothing wrong to me. But I have to do it, Mom and Dad aren't real. The stench of the blood from my father is invading my nostrils.I need to close my eyes again, the blackness comforts me better than the view of the dead bodies in the living room. I should feel no guilt, my real family is waiting for me...
