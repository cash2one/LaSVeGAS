523974:::::How I Paint: Secrets of a Sunday Painter:::::What is the process by which a painting comes into being? What goes on in the artist's mind? What different techniques are used in creating a still life, landscape, or portrait? In this look at the complex, often mysterious painting process, painter/museum director Thomas S. Buechner combines clear how-to instruction with striking insights to help us look at pictures in a wholly new way. An expert on painting techniques, Buechner offers valuable tips for both amateur and professional painters on traditional methods that many schools do not teach today. An impassioned painter himself, whose work hangs in The Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American Art, Buechner includes illustrations of many of his most inspired paintings and drawings-some shown in step-by-step series with enlarged details-illuminating for us the intimate relationship between the artist and his materials. 129 illustrations, 98 in full color, 8 1/2 x 10 3/4" THOMAS S. BUECHNER, former director of the Brooklyn Museum of Art and the Corning Museum of Glass, is the author of several books, most notably Abrams' definitive biography Norman Rockwell: Artist and Illustrator. In addition to his long experience in interpreting works of art for museumgoers, Buechner brings to this book the perspective gained from decades of teaching painting.
