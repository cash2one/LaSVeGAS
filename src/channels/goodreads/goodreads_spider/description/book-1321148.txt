1321148:::::The Bum's Rush:::::Packed with all the outrageous shenanigans that quickly marked Who in Hell is Wanda Fuca? and Cast in Stone as two of the most original mysteries in years, G.M. Ford crafts a devilishly funny and bat-out-of-hell paced novel featuring his smart-aleck yet irrepressible Seattle-based p.i., Leo Waterman.Nobody loves you when you're down and out--except maybe Leo Waterman. As a man who has transformed a gaggle of residentially challenged devotees of cheap alcohol into a crack surveillance team, Leo has a soft spot for society's downtrodden. When a homeless woman says she's the mother of a deceased rock idol, Leo takes it upon himself to investigate the lady's claim, thereby embroiling the Boys, his dissolute deputies, and his own already bruised body in a high speed, life-threatening pursuit of the truth.
