408833:::::Voluntary Servitude: Poems:::::A chilling and masterful second poetry collection by Mark Wunderlich, the author of the award-winning The Anchorage Sometimes the heart breaks. Sometimes it is not held hostage. The red world where cells prepare for the unexpected splays open at the window's ledge. Be not human you inhuman thing. -from "Amaryllis" Voluntary Servitude asks of the beloved, "You say, Don't wreck me, and I say I won't, but how can I know that?" Here the poet is both servant and master to memory, sex, family, and the will of the lover, and the resulting poems describe the physical and psychological constraints and releases of relationships at the breaking point.
