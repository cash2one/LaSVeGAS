Traditionally, science of well-being has been considered as a branch of social science. However, it is currently considered as an interdisciplinary science that collaborates with other fields such as medicine, neuroscience, neurobiology, physiology, chemistry, psychology, genetics, behavioral science, social science and economics. Science of well-being includes physical well-being, mental well-being, spiritual well-being and social well-being. In the book Dr. Ray explains how yoga is related to all these four aspects of well-being. Yoga has four central components: physical yoga, energy yoga, action-yoga and wisdom-yoga. Each of these four domains is related to a different meaning of the scientifically clumsy term well-being, and each has its own road to happiness. . Throughout the life our song changes, in the young age we need education at the older age we need protection and care. Therefore life has many levels of well-being. Yoga deals with all levels of well-being in a systematic manner. The author does a great job explaining what yoga can offer for the well-being of individual and for the society as a whole.
