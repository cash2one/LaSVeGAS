Bainbridge, the cad who now inhabits Milligan's arachnid form, is known throughout the galaxy as thoroughly selfish and uncivilised. What he might get up to with a body such as Milligan's simply does not bear thinking about. With the help of Milligan's mechanical valet Forsythe, his revered Uncle Angus, his psychotic cousin Gertrude, and Pigstick, his former comrade in arms, he must recover his arachnid body and prevent Bainbridge from disgracing his family name. Through twists and turns, Milligan's pursuit leads him into thrilling adventures. Be prepared for "daring espionage, scandalous scenes," and "perilous levels of dry wit."
