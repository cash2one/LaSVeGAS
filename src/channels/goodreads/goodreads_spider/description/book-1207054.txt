1207054:::::Rodeo Rider:::::STEVIE, CAROLE, AND Lisa are off to Texas to visit their friend Kate Devine at her family s ranch the Bar None. It s the perfect time to visit, since the annual rodeo has come to town! The girls decide they don t want to just watch the wranglers compete; they re going to enter the competition too. And they need every minute to practice if they re going to go up against real cowboys. But when they realize someone's trying to sabotage the Bar None competitors, the girls real work begins. And it s just the kind of work the Saddle Club is made for.
