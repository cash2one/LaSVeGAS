9714741:::::The One Year Devos for Animal Lovers: Cool Things Animals Show Us about Our Creator:::::Dandi Daley Mackall is an avid animal lover and best-selling writer of many animal books (including Winnie the Horse Gentler and Starlight Animal Rescue); she clearly has a gift for sharing animal stories in a unique and interesting style. Her gift comes through once again in this One Year devotion that uses animals to point to spiritual truths. Each devotion begins with a fun or interesting fact about an animal; this fact then introduces a concept of life and godliness that is reinforced by a scripture verse. The devotion concludes with an activity to do that day that relates to the devotion; there is also a sidebar with more fun/interesting facts. The animals used in this devotion range from the beloved and familiar (such as horses and dogs) to the extraordinary and unfamiliar (such as the kookaburra and the Pompeii worm).
