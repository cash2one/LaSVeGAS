They appear to be cursed: everyone of Starker blood has died after being struck by lightning. Fourteen-year-old Newton Starker is the last of his line except for his great-grandmother, Enid, a woman as friendly as a pickled wolverine and he s determined to survive. Newton has spent all of his life surviving, following a list of rules for self-preservation, guidelines passed down through generations of Starkers. But Newton wants to try something new. He has enrolled at Jerry Potts Academy of Higher Learning and Survival in Moose Jaw with the hope that he ll be able to beat the odds he has a dream of becoming a great chef someday. If he wants to go beyond just getting by, Newton is going to need more than rules. He s going to need friends. From the creative mind of award-winning writer Arthur Slade author of Dust , Tribes and Megiddo s Shadow comes a quirky, laugh-out-loud story about dreaming big, standing out and knowing when you need help. HIGHLIGHTS FROM NEWTON STARKER'S RULES FOR SURVIVAL Do not take a bath during a thunderstorm. When thunder roars, go indoors. Fast! Beware of cumulonimbus clouds. Check the weather before exiting any building. Remember not to get angry. Anger has been the downfall of many a Starker. If your hair stands on end, you are about to be struck by lightning.
