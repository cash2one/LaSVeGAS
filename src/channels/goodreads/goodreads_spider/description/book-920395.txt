920395:::::Only Forward:::::Michael Marshall Smith s surreal, groundbreaking, and award-winning debut which resonates with wild humour interlaced with dark recollections of an emotional minefield. Stark lives in Colour, a neighbourhood whose inhabitants like to be co-ordinated with their surroundings a neighbourhood where spangly purple trousers are admired by the walls of buildings as you pass them. Close by is Sound, where you mustn t make any, apart from one designated hour a day when you can scream your lungs raw. Then there s Red get off at Fuck Station Zero if you want to see a tactical nuclear battle recreated as a sales demonstration. Stark has friends in Red, which is just as well because Something is about to happen. And when a Something happens it s no good chanting Duck and cover while cowering in a corner, because a Something is always from the past, Stark s past, and it won t go away until you face it full on.
