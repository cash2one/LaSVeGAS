1322303:::::The Fox and The Hound:::::Tod, a red fox, is sharp-witted, cunning, dauntless, and valiant. His ability to defy death becomes legendary. Copper, a half-bloodhound tracker, is the dog who lives to hunt the fox and, along with his beloved master, embarks on a lifelong quest to end the life of the elusive Tod. Described from the animal's perspectives, the paths of these rivals intersect and overlap in a world teeming with scent, sound, sight and instinct. Their story is vivid, gripping, absorbing, arresting and unflinching. The reader's awareness of wildlife and the essence of their domain may be reshaped and refined and, in the end, irrevocably changed.
