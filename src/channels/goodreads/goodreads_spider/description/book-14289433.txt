14289433:::::Uncle Tom's Cabin:::::Alternate cover edition of 0140390030 / 9780140390032 A powerful indictment by America's first major woman novelist, "Uncle Tom's Cabin" was hailed by Tolstoy as "one of the greatest productions of the human mind." Published in 1852, "Uncle Tom's Cabin" brought the abolitionists' message to the White House and beyond - no woman before or since Harriet Beecher Stowe has so successfully written a novel designed to motivate America to act on a major issue of the day. Controversial still, this novel has weathered continual debates on all aspects of its writing and its subject matter. In her eloquent introduction, noted American Studies scholar Ann Douglas establishes the historical and literary significance of "Uncle Tom's Cabin": accurate in its portrayal of the slave experience, brilliant in its narrative structure and use of dialogue, and profoundly feminist in its implications.
