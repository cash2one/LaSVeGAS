551866:::::I and Thou:::::An alternate cover for this isbn can be found here . Martin Buber's I &amp; Thou has long been acclaimed as a classic. Many prominent writers have acknowledged its influence on their work. Students of intellectual history consider it a landmark. The generation born since WWII considers Buber as one of its prophets. The need for a new English translation has been felt for years. The old version was marred by many inaccuracies &amp; misunderstandings. Its recurrent use of the archaic "thou" was seriously misleading. Now Prof. Walter Kaufmann, a distinguished writer &amp; philosopher in his own right who was close to Buber, has retranslated the work at the request of Buber's family. He's added a wealth of informative footnotes to clarify obscurities &amp; bring readers closer to the original. He's written a long Prologue that opens up new perspectives on the book &amp; Buber's thought. This volume should provide a new basis for all future discussions of Buber.
