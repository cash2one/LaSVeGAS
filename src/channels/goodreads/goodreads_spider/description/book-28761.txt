28761:::::The Last Herald-Mage:::::Alienated from his family, unsuited to life as a warrior or landholder, Vanyel is entrusted to the care of his aunt, Savil, a Herald-Mage in the kingdom of Valdemar. Sensing that there is something unusual about the youth, Savil seeks to help him discover his true talents. Yet it is not until his friend and fellow student Tylendel opens a Gate of power and unleashes horror upon the land that Vanyel's latent talents are jolted awake -- with dangerous effects. The only thing that may save Vanyel from his own wild magic is the intervention of a Companion, one of the beautiful, mysterious beings in the form of great white horses who bond for life with a chosen human Herald or Herald-Mage. But though Vanyel may prove to be the most powerful Herald-Mage Valdemar has ever seen -- if he survives long enough to master his abilities -- desperate trials await him. For ill luck has taken an increasingly heavy toll on Valdemar with each passing year, claiming the lives of many among the Herald-Mages. Even more disturbing, there is no rest for Vanyel even in sleep, for his dreams have long been haunted by the barely glimpsed image of an unknown enemy -- one who may be only a figment of his own imagining... or the creature responsible for all the evil and misfortune that plague the kingdom. Is Vanyel Foreseeing his own doom, as he believes in his darkest moments? Or are the dreams a warning that will enable him to save Valdemar, his fellow Herald-Mages, and himself? Includes Magic's Pawn , Magic's Promise , and Magic's Price .
