19140641:::::Heritage:::::Kara Magari isn't normal, even by Ourea's standards--and in a world of shape-shifters and soul stealers, that's saying something. To the royalty, she's a loose cannon. To the masses, she's a failure. But Kara doesn't have a home to go back to anymore. This war-torn world is all she has left, and she'll save it even if she dies trying. An ancient isen named Stone takes an interest in Kara's training, and it turns out he has more answers than he originally led her to believe. In an effort to unearth a secret that might end the bloodshed, Kara instead discovers an ugly truth about her family--and how much she has in common with one of the most evil men in Ourean history. Braeden Drakonin has slowly rebuilt his life after the betrayal that tore it apart. His father wants him dead, and frankly, his so-called allies wouldn't mind that either. Private alliances are formed. Secrets are sold. Tension is driving the armies apart. A single battle will end this war, and it's coming. Braeden may be a prince, but it will take more than royal blood to survive. He must take the fight to his father's door--and win. ---------------- Novels in the Grimoire Saga: Lichgates (#1) Treason (#2) Heritage (#3) Illusion (#4)
