4593274:::::Everyday Life:::::Growing up in Long Beach, California, L is a positive hard working young man desperate to escape the trappings of a violent life in the Hood. He is guided only by his strong sense of self and the need to provide a better life for his daughter. L shares powerful childhood bonds with his three best friends, C - ex-military/gangsta, E - hustler/activist and B - a promising young rapper. L is constantly at odds with the world in which he finds himself. But in a neighborhood dominated by gangs, drugs, alcohol, guns and self-created obstacles there are no guarantees, especially when it comes to making it out alive. EveryDay Life relays powerful messages about life, death and all things in-between in America s urban ghettos and forces people to look at issues that are all too easy to ignore from urban sprawl, race relations to sex and politics. This is a work of literature that that holds no punches while delivering an extremely humorous story. It is far from just a story about a selected African American community in Los Angeles, it s about all of us and what we choose as our life. It is a true piece of African-Americana. Honestly everyone who picks up EveryDay Life wont get it, but those that do have said that it is now their favorite book.
