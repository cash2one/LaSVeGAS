20434791:::::The adventure of Charles Agustus Milverton:::::This is a story from The Return of Sherlock Holmes II collection. No case is too slight for the mental powers of the Great Detective in this second selection from The Return of Sherlock Holmes. A young girl is stalked by a "Solitary Cyclist"; whilst the "Dancing Men" hieroglyphics found in Norfolk lead to a sinister connection with America. Holmes enters the murky world of high society blackmail in "Charles Augustus Milverton"; and finds an abducted student from the "Priory School". As always, his friend Dr. Watson is with him to assist and chronicle these cases.
