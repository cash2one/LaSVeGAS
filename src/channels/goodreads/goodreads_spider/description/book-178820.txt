178820:::::In China's Shadow: The Crisis of American Entrepreneurship:::::This book begins with an eye-opening exploration of the rise of China s economy and an assessment of its potential for further rapid growth. The implications of China s new power are nothing short of profound, Reed Hundt contends. In China's Shadow proceeds to paint a detailed landscape of the new reality confronting American businesses and citizens. For the first time in over one hundred years, Americans face critical challenges to their economy and way of life owing not only to China s impending economic might but also to the drift of U.S. business practices and government regulations over the past decade. Aiming for a respectable defeat in the competition of nations will imperil not only the American Dream of an ever-increasing standard of living but also the American project itself, Hundt warns. Meeting the foreseeable challenges is not a matter of legislative strategy from the political left or right or prescriptive plans for businesses. The best chance for Americans to lead the world in job and wealth creation lies in an expanded and renewed culture of entrepreneurship. Hundt reviews the lessons of the 1990s, when the architectures of law, technology, and leadership produced a robust culture of entrepreneurship, and analyzes how entrepreneurship is being undermined today. He challenges Americans to do what they do best adapt, invent, innovate, take risks and points the way for a reinvigorated entrepreneurial society.
