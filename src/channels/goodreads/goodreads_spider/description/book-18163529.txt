18163529:::::Cocaine:::::Paris in the 1920s dizzy and decadent. Where a young man can make a fortune with his wits unless he is led into temptation. Cocaine s dandified hero Tito Arnaudi invents lurid scandals and gruesome deaths, and sells these stories to the newspapers. But his own life becomes even more outrageous than his press reports when he acquires three demanding mistresses. Elegant, witty and wicked, Pitigrilli s classic novel was first published in Italian in 1921 and charts the comedy and tragedy of a young man s downfall and the lure of a bygone era. The novel s descriptions of sex and drug use prompted church authorities to place it on a list of forbidden books, while appealing to filmmaker Rainer Werner Fassbinder who wrote a script based on the tale. Cocaine retains its venom even today.
