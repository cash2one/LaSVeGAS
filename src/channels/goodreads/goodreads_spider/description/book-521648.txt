521648:::::The Arms of Krupp: The Rise and Fall of the Industrial Dynasty that Armed Germany at War:::::A masterwork of history restored to print and made available for the first time in trade paperback. In this massive, compellingly readable book, America's preeminent biographer/historian brings to life Europe's richest, most powerful family, a 400-year dynasty that developed the world's most technologically advanced weapons (from cannons to submarines to anti-aircraft guns); provided arms to generations of German leaders, including the Kaiser and Hitler; operated private concentration camps during the Nazi era; survived conviction at Nuremberg; and wielded enormous influence on the course of world events. William Manchester's account of the rise and fall of the Krupp dynasty is history as it should be written, alive with all its terrifying power.
