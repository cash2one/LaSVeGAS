13631536:::::Zombie Zone Zero:::::In this hauntingly savage tale of survival, a group of strangers trapped in a liquor store in Prince George, British Columbia, struggle to stay alive in the first few weeks of the zombie apocalypse during the depths of a bitter Canadian winter in late 2012. Led by store manager, Chris Daniels, and the mysterious, but brutally effective, Arthur Johnson, the ragtag group eventually escapes the city and goes on the run from town to town across a province that has gone from one of the most beautiful places in the world to a frigid landscape of gruesome terror, where the dead desire only to rend the flesh of the living. However, the hordes of ravenous flesh-eating corpses soon become overshadowed by an even greater danger. Other survivors roam the lonely wastelands of the frozen north and one group is ruthlessly hunting all of the others, cruelly slaughtering every living soul in celebration of the end of the world. At times darkly amusing, Zombie Zone Zero is both an erotic love story and a gruesome horror tale, but mostly it is a story of redemption. Spanning the towns of Prince George, Vanderhoof, Fraser Lake, Burns Lake, Houston, Smithers, Hazelton and Terrace, before ending in the rugged wilderness of Princess Royal Island, in BC's Great Bear Rainforest, home of the Kermode Spirit bear, Zombie Zone Zero finishes with a final showdown between good and evil that will leave you breathless.
