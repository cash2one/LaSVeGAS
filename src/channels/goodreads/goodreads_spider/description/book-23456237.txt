23456237:::::The King's Scrolls:::::Following the harrowing events that brought them to Landale Forest, Jace and Kyrin have settled comfortably into their new lives and the mission of protecting those under the emperor s persecution. The fast approach of winter brings with it the anticipation of a quiet few months ahead. That is until the arrival of four mysterious, dragon-riding cretes who seek aid in a mission of great importance not only to their own people, but to all followers of El m. Hidden in the vast mining valley north of Valcr , a faithful crete has spent years sharing his knowledge with the destitute miners and their families and is known to possess what may be Arcacia s last surviving copies of the King s Scrolls the Word of El m. Joining the cretes, those in Landale must find the crete teacher and bring him to safety, but it is a race against time. Should Daican s men find him first, execution and the destruction of the Scrolls is certain. When disaster strikes, all seems lost. Could El m have a plan even in the enemy s triumph?
