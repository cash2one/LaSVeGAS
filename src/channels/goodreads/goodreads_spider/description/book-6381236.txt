6381236:::::For the Love of Dogs:::::From the author of the Copper Star series, winner of multiple awards, comes this heartwarming tale of Samantha Christiansen, a young woman who is capable, confident, good at her job of managing the family's olive oil ranch...and is going blind. Gently pushed by her family to get a guide dog, Samantha is partnered with Azure, a yellow lab with infinite patience. Samantha and Azure are assigned to Jack Shaw, an instructor known for bringing out the best in his students...even those with absolutely no experience with dogs, like Samantha. Jack understands how difficult it can be to trust the unseen. A former professional football player, he lost everything-his career and his family-through a costly mistake. Jack is determined to make the rest of his life count for something. He knows he can help Samantha, if only she'll let him. Fiercely independent, Samantha is reluctant to depend on anyone or anything, even a guide dog that is trained to enhance her independence. While at the guide dog school, Samantha is faced with discovering a new way of seeing: trusting in what, or whom, she cannot see.
