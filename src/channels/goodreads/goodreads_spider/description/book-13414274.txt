13414274:::::Faint Echoes Of Laughter:::::The shocking and spirited sequel to the much-praised Empty Chairs . Life on the streets of Sydney was preferable to the nightmare Stacey Danson had survived in the hell that was home. She hit the streets running at the age of eleven, and armed with a flick-knife and a fierce determination to live a different life, she began the journey from the 1960s to today. For those that came to know Sassy girl in 'Empty Chairs', and for those caring people that asked how her life worked out from there, 'Faint Echoes of Laughter' continues the story. For those that haven t met her yet, this book stands alone as a tribute to the kindness of strangers, the loyalty of true friendships and the way things really are on the streets of any town .... anytime.
