1547379:::::Winona's Web: A Novel of Discovery:::::To the surprise of her family, Winona Pathfinder, an elderly Lakota Sioux medicine woman, announces she intends to die in two months. For counseling, Winona is referred to psychologist Dr. Meggie O'Connor--Caucasian, middle-aged, and divorced. A reluctant client, the feisty Winona decides to turn the tables and teach Dr. O'Connor a thing or two about life, while steadfastly refusing to renounce her plans to die. As fall turns to winter on the scenic Leelanau Peninsula of Michigan, Winona casts her web around the doctor. Ever-dubious, Meggie O'Connor sees her professional methods slowly crumble before the earthy humor and soaring spirit of her new teacher. Who is healing whom? Can the doctor convince Winona to step back from the gates to the spirit world? As Meggie's eyes open, she also rediscovers the pull of romance, involving her with two intriguing Native American men. Strange visions begin to appear, and Meggie faces a battle of wills with her stubborn patient armed with a prayer pipe, a strong heart, and the conviction that she is about to "cross over." Graceful and powerful, the story is deeply rooted in traditional Lakota teachings. Winona's Web will delight you and touch your heart with its message of hope and prayer, love and loss, and learning to listen to the web of the world.
