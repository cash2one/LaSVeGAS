20708785:::::Ship of Dolls:::::Can a ship carrying Friendship Dolls to Japan be Lexie s ticket to see her fun-loving mother again? A heartwarming historical novel inspired by a little-known true event. It s 1926, and the one thing eleven-year-old Lexie Lewis wants more than anything is to leave Portland, Oregon, where she has been staying with her strict grandparents, and rejoin her mother, a carefree singer in San Francisco s speakeasies. But Mama s new husband doesn t think a little girl should live with parents who work all night and sleep all day. Meanwhile, Lexie s class has been raising money to ship a doll to the children of Japan in a friendship exchange, and when Lexie learns that the girl who writes the best letter to accompany the doll will be sent to the farewell ceremony in San Francisco, she knows she just has to be the winner. But what if a jealous classmate and Lexie s own small lies to her grandmother manage to derail her plans? Inspired by a project organized by teacher-missionary Sidney Gulick, in which U.S. children sent more than 12,000 Friendship Dolls to Japan in hopes of avoiding a future war, Shirley Parenteau s engaging story has sure appeal for young readers who enjoy historical fiction, and for doll lovers of all ages.
