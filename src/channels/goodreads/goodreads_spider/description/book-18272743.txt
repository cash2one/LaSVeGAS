"Rendezvous with Hymera follows the development of a beautiful love story and a bizarre chain of events which lead to the investigation of a mystery that falls into a strange and somewhat paranormal discipline - Yoga.

In the scene enters Colin Lambert, a special man from Clara s past. Their attempts to elucidate the intriguing mystery bring them close again and the unfinished business between them turns into a beautiful and hot love story. The fate of the female enigma of this story seems to resemble, in a strange way, that of the people lost during The Philadelphia Experiment.".
