1523931:::::Above Us Only Sky: Liverpool FC's Global Revolution:::::Liverpool's third season under Rafael Ben tez was a tumultuous time both on and off the pitch. In 2007 Liverpool FC finally changed hands, with Americans George Gillett Jr. and Tom Hicks buying the club; work began on a radically redesigned state-of-the-art stadium at Stanley Park; and the team reached a seventh European Cup final. Without doubt a new era has begun. Above Us Only Sky is much more than just the story of one season. As well as reflecting on the recent past, this book looks to the future, to examine how the new regime can make the Reds competitive in all aspects of the game - from silverware, and the pounds (and dollars) that help secure it, through to the players to whom Gillett and Hicks will be looking to achieve success on the pitch, including exciting new signings Fernando Torres and Ryan Babel, to name just two. What do the Reds need to do to win a 19th league crown ? Above Us Only Sky also examines how Liverpool FC has evolved from the provincial club of the 1960s, to now touch the lives of people in every corner of the globe. What does it mean to be a Liverpool fan in the new millennium, either as a native Liverpudlian or as one born thousands of miles away ? How can the club move forward with a large and diverse fan base whose members, both local and global, have very different needs and desires ?
