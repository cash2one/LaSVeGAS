18051:::::The Small Bachelor:::::What must a man do in order to put an end to his bachelorhood? For George Finch, one of nature's white mice and probably the worst artist ever to put brush to canvas, there are many obstacles. Undoubtedly the greatest is his beloved Molly's fearsome stepmother, Mrs. Waddington, who has her eye on an eligible English lord for a son-in-law. Luckily, George has an ally in sharp-witted Hamilton Beamish, an old family friend of the Waddingtons, not to mention George's butler, Mullett, and his light-fingered girlfriend, Fanny, whose valuable skills are of particular interest to the would-be father-in-law. Wodehouse is the greatest comic writer ever. (Douglas Adams) Mr. Wodehouse's idyllic world can never stale. He has made a world for us to live in and delight in. (Evelyn Waugh) Author Bio: P.G. Wodehouse (1881-1975) grew up in England and came to the United States just before World War I, when he married an American. He wrote more than 90 books, and his works, translated into many languages, have won him worldwide acclaim.
