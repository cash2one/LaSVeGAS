29238350:::::Commissioning:::::They re not saints, nor are they heroes. No, they ve been chosen for something deeper, their strength, because they believe in Good, but understand they have to embrace the Evil in order to defeat it. They will do what saints can t, what heroes won t, fighting a secret war for an end that, at times, will require accepting horrific means. They are Tricent, the elite unit of spies branded with one mission: to protect the very foundation of Rome and stand between peace and chaos. Jason is a slave and ex-gladiator, young, beautiful, and hardened by his struggle to survive a harsh life of unspeakable evil. Mallia is an elite Senator s daughter, embedded in a privileged world she s come to despise. Argus and Tacitus are disgraced soldiers, cast from their legion and the only life they ve known. Assembled by Severus, a retired General and close confidant of the Emperor, they will die to their old lives and be reborn as something entirely different. TRICENT is a modern story of intrigue, heartache, romance, and suspense set against the backdrop of an imagined Ancient Rome in all its glory and horror.
