6673172:::::Shadow Tag:::::Erdrich is a true original [and] one of our major writers. Washington Post Book World Shadow Tag , the brilliant new novel by Louise Erdrich, is a stunning tour-de-force from the National Book Critics Circle Award winning and New York Times bestselling author of Love Medicine and Pulitzer-Prize-finalist The Plague of Doves . In the vein of the novels of such contemporaries as Zoe Heller and Susan Minot, Shadow Tag is an intense and heart-wrenching story of a troubled marriage and a family in disarray and a radical departure from Erdrich s previous acclaimed work.
