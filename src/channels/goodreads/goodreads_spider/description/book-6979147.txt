6979147:::::Baby, It's Cold Outside:::::(Same as Melting Point) Heather had just left her salon on the way to a Christmas party at her cousin's house when it began to snow. Quinton hasn't been able to stop thinking about Heather since he met her a few months ago, so when he spots her walking down the street, he can't resist stopping to offer her a ride......anywhere she wants to go......even when he finds out that her destination is three hours away through the mountains. When the mountain pass is closed for snow removal, leaving Quinton and Heather temporarily stranded by the side of the road, they decide to generate their own heat to pass the time.
