Not for the first time you run into a house that could be full of guns, with death waiting for you. It is a time of profound change for Ellie Linton. Enemies are everywhere. Some come crawling over the hills; others drive in and knock on the front door. Sometimes her friends are at her side and sometimes she is on her own. Ellie is a fighter. She has faith in her own abilities. But she is not Superwoman. Never has she faced enemies so ruthless, so brutal. And not every battle can be won with a gun and bullets. When the ammunition runs out, who will be left standing? Trapped and helpless, Ellie must face the end of life as she knows it...sustained only by strength and imagination.
