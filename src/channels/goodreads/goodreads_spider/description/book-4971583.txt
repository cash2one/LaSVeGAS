4971583:::::The Wallflower:::::Is Emma ready for a bite? Emma Carter has been in love with Max Cannon since high school, but he barely knew she existed. Now she runs her own unique curio shop, and she's finally come out her shell and into her own. When Max returns to his small home town to take up his duties as the Halle Pride's Alpha, he finds that shy little Emma has grown up. That small spark of something he'd always felt around the teenager has blossomed into something more--his mate! Taking her--out for a bite--ensures that the luscious Emma will be permanently his. But Max's ex has plans of her own. Plans that don't include Emma being around to interfere. To keep her Alpha, Emma must prove to the Pride that she has what it takes to be Max's mate. Warning: This title contains explicit sex, graphic language, loads of giggles and a hot, blond Alpha male.
