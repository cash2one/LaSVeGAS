31299:::::Hickory Dickory Dock:::::An outbreak of kleptomania at a student hostel was not normally the sort of crime that aroused Hercule Poirot's interest.

He congratulated the warden, Mrs. Hubbard, on a "unique and beautiful problem."The list made absolutely no sense at all. But, reasoned Poirot, if this was merely a petty thief at work, why was everyone at the hostel so frightened?
