90988:::::Christie Malry's Own Double-Entry:::::B.S. Johnson's funniest and most accessible novel, reissued for the first time in 25 years. Christie Malry is a simple person. Born into a family without money, he realised early along in the game that the best way to come by money was to place himself next to it. So he took a job as a very junior bank clerk in a very stuffy bank. It was at the bank that Christie discovered the principles of double-entry bookkeeping, from which he evolved his Great Idea. For every offence Christy henceforth received at the hands of a society with which he was clearly out of step, a debit must be noted; after which, society would have to be paid back appropriately, so that the paper credit would accrue to Christy's account. Acerbic yet funny, this is a novel which, even as it provokes laughter, will alarm and disturb as well.
