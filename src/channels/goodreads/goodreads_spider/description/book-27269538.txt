27269538:::::A Lover's Lament:::::In a matter of seconds my entire world changed, and it was in that moment that I stopped living and simply began to exist. In my grief, I sent a letter to the first boy I ever loved. I hoped in writing it I d find some peace from the nightmare I was living, some solace in my anger. I didn t expect him to write back. I wasn t prepared for his words, and I certainly wasn t ready for the impact this soldier would have on my life. A deep-rooted hate transformed into friendship, and then molded into a love like I d never known before. Sergeant Devin Ulysses Clay did what I couldn t: he put the shattered pieces of my heart back together, restoring my faith in humanity and teaching me how to live again. But now that I m whole, I have a decision to make. Do I return to my life as I knew it and the fianc I left behind, or do I walk away from it all for the only man to ever break my heart? *** I ve been living in hell, but you won t hear me complain. These men depend on me, as I do them, and this brotherhood is the only family I ve ever known. The Army saved me from a callous mother and a life on the wrong side of the tracks that was quickly spiraling out of control. So unlike most of the men in my platoon, going home wasn t something I longed for. I was content overseas, spending my days defending this country that gave me my life back. Fighting became my new normal until her. A letter from Katie Devora a letter that I almost didn t open. Her words put a fire back inside of me that I didn t know I d lost. She gave me hope during a time when I was fighting every day just to stay alive, and now it s time I fight for her.
