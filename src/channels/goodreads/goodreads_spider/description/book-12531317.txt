12531317:::::Wicked Game:::::Cass Pendleton and Jaime Dalton have been mortal enemies since the first day of kindergarten when Jaime pulled her hair and Cass knocked him flat on his ass. Jaime is on the verge of superstardom in the NFL; all that s missing is a Super Bowl ring and a personal assistant who can handle his business without handling his business. Cass seems to be the best person for the job. She s smart, mouthy, dependable, pig-headed, loyal, and completely not his type. So why can t Jaime think of anything except Cass? He knows one thing for dead certain. If the game doesn t kill him, sex with Cass Pendleton most definitely will.
