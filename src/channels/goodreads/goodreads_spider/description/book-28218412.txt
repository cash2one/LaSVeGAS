28218412:::::The Adventure Begins:::::The new and improved CASCADE ADVENTURES, book 1. Coming soon! Young Kale Dillans lived a perfect life: he was the star player and captain of his island's waterball team, fans who adored him, peers who envied him, and a girlfriend who couldn't get enough of him. But on one particularly sunny morning, Kale awakens to find a boy with pointed ears claiming that Kale's tropical island paradise will be destroyed in just 12 measly hours unless Kale goes with him. Needless to say, Kale doesn't believe him. So Kale goes on about his day, a day like any other... but then the elf boy's prophecy comes true, and Kale dies. His whole world ends... but Kale does not. He awakens, naked and alone, in a shattered world where nothing is as it seems: the inhabitants are all crazy loons, yet strangely loveable. The Queen receives strange visions that she claims to be "prophecies of the future" and no one but her believes in them. Two witches collect the wandering souls of the dead and feed them to a horrid beast living in their potion shop. So, Kale begins taking steps to find out the truth of what exactly happened to his island, and if that means teaming up with a mopey mechanic and an uptight magician to stop the same mysterious entity that destroyed Kale's home from destroying what remains of this one, then so be it.
