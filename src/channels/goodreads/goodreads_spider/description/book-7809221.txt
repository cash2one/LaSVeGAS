7809221:::::M Is for Mama's Boy:::::NERDS combines all the excitement of international espionage with all the awkwardness of elementary school, and the results are hilarious. A group of unpopular fifth graders run a spy network from inside their school. With the help of cutting-edge science, they transform their nerdy qualities into incredible abilities! Their enemies? An array of James Bond style villains, each with an evil plan more diabolical and more ridiculous than the last. Publishers Weekly raved: Buckley has a flair for exaggerated humor. School Library Journal said: Funny, clever, and thoroughly entertaining. Praise for NERDS: M is for Mama's Boy "Fans of the first novel will find even more laughs here." Booklist "Peppered with lessons on cracking codes, ciphers and invisible ink, the second adventure in Buckley s silly spy-kids spoof is as frenetically goofy as the first .a terrific package for reluctant readers or book lovers out for thrills, gadgets and larfs." Kirkus Reviews
