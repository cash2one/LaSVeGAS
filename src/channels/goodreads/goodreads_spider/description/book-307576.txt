307576:::::Vapor:::::Soon to be a major motion picture directed by Neil LaBute and starring Renee Zellweger, this is a surreal love story from the author of Nude Men. Now in paperback, Amanda Filipacchi's quirky comic romance gives aspiring actress Anna Graham a makeover that no reader will ever forget. Anna's payback for rescuing the eccentric scientist Damon Wetly from a subway mugger is imprisonment in a specially designed cage designed to transform her into the foremost actress of her time. How Anna succeeds in both her acting career and turning the tables on Damon is a reversal of the Pygmalion myth and a perversely tender love story.
