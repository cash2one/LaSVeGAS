Sent to accompany and protect him is Ash, a genetically modified supersoldier raised and trained by an infamous death cult. Corwyn is lousy with superheroes, led by the obnoxious Dark Justice. Kaede finds himself dancing around Dark Justice as he digs into his father s mysterious business and teaches his socially awkward but physically lethal bodyguard to acclimate to normal life.

The course of love and world domination never did run smooth.
