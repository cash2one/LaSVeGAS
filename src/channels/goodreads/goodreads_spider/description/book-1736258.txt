1736258:::::Cassidy:::::The story of the Mormon farm boy from Southern Utah who put together the longest string of successful bank and train robberies in the history of the American West. Unlike most cowboy outlaws of his day, Butch Cassidy defended the poor and oppressed, refused to shoot people, and shared his stolen wealth with those in need. Early in his outlaw career, Butch discovered true love. Her name was Mary, and the love they shared lasted for decades. However, Pinkerton agents, law officers, bank detectives and bounty hunters chased Cassidy relentlessly, making it impossible for him to leave the outlaw life, eventually pushing him to seek refugein Argentina and Bolivia. But in the end Butch outsmarted them all.
