18461891:::::Revealing Kia:::::The events of Claudia s party were nothing more than a distant memory as far as Kia was concerned. She was ready to resume her life as though that night had never happened. But it s a slippery slope keeping a secret and Kia s about to learn just how hard when she s faced with the truth and the consequences of her decision. Adam Chaves was no stranger to girls wanting him. He was no stranger to breaking hearts, although never intentionally. What he didn t understand was how Kia could undress him, touch him, burn him with her eyes and still keep him at arm s length when it was evident how much it cost her. But what Kia didn t realize was that he had never given up on anything in his life and he wasn t about to start now. He would have his girl even if it meant he had to kidnap her to do it.
