"The book and the film really complement each other." From the singular mind of horror maestro Rob Zombie comes a chilling plunge into a nightmare world where evil runs in the blood... THE LORDS OF SALEM Heidi Hawthorne is a thirty-seven-year-old FM radio DJ and a recovering drug addict. Struggling with her newfound sobriety and creeping depression, Heidi suddenly receives an anonymous gift at the station-a mysteriously shaped wooden box branded with a strange symbol. Inside the box is a promotional record for a band that identifies themselves only as The Lords . There is no other information. She decides to play it on the radio show as a joke, and the moment she does, horrible things begin to happen. The strange music awakens something evil in the town. Soon enough, terrifying murders begin to happen all around Heidi. Who are The Lords? What do they want? As old bloodlines are awakened and the bodies start to pile up, only one thing seems certain: all hell is about to break loose.
