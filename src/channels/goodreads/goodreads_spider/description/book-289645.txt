289645:::::On Every Side:::::After suffering the loss of his mother and separation from his sister and the girl he loved, Jordan Riley fills the holes in his soul with anger. But Faith Evans begins to disassemble the walls around Jordan s heart, and he realizes there s something very familiar about her Everything Is on the Line ...for Faith Evans, an up-and-coming newscaster. A woman of honor and integrity, who finds herself making a stand against the one man she never imagined would be her enemy... ...for Jordan Riley, a powerful attorney dedicated to fighting for human rights and against God. A man still reckoning with the boyhood loss of the three women who once meant everything to him... ...for Bethany, Pennsylvania, a small town no one ever dreamed would become the center of national attention. But it has. All because of a beloved, hundred-year-old statue of Jesus Christ that stands in Bethany s park. A statue that some say is a clear violation of separation of church and state. A statue that has to come down. A statue that suddenly becomes the focus of a bitter conflict one rife with political intrigue, social injustice, and personal conflicts. Before it s over, everything that Jordan and Faith and the town of Bethany stand for will be challenged. Will love be enough when the battle rages on every side? Story Behind the Book Each of my novels is a piece of my heart. Where Yesterday Lives was my first-ever novel, and as such it is somewhat autobiographical. The childhood story of Ellen Barrett, her love for her parents and siblings, is my story though her current story and struggles are fictional. On Every Side sheds light on the struggle for religious freedom in today s climate; something I am passionate about. Finally, When Joy Came to Stay is the story of one woman s battle against depression and the secrets of her past. Karen Kingsbury
