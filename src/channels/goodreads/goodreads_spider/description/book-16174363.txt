16174363:::::Dark Space:::::Brady Garrett needs to go home. He s a conscripted recruit on Defender Three, one of a network of stations designed to protect the Earth from alien attack. He's also angry, homesick, and afraid. If he doesn t get home he ll lose his family, but there s no way back except in a body bag. Cameron Rushton needs a heartbeat. Four years ago Cam was taken by the Faceless the alien race that almost destroyed Earth. Now he s back, and when the doctors make a mess of getting him out of stasis, Brady becomes his temporary human pacemaker. Except they re sharing more than a heartbeat: they re sharing thoughts, memories, and some very vivid dreams. Not that Brady s got time to worry about his growing attraction to another guy, especially the one guy in the universe who can read his mind. It doesn t mean anything. It s just biochemistry and electrical impulses. It doesn t change the truth: Brady s alone in the universe. Now the Faceless are coming and there s nothing anyone can do. You can t stop your nightmares. Cam says everyone will live, but Cam s probably a traitor and a liar like the military thinks. But that s okay. Guys like Brady don t expect happy endings.
