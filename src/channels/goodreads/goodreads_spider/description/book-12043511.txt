12043511:::::Trinity:::::Book I - Trinity of the Dark Legacy Cycle details the violent end of the Kai Order - an ancient, spiritual guild of warrior guardians and priestesses who have sworn their lives to protect the Oracle Queen of Atlantis - at the hands of Maniok, the being referred to as the "Great Evil" in the age-old Song of the Oracle King. It is a chronicle of Arkan, the last Kai guardian, and his desperate attempt to save the life of his priestess who carries his unborn son, and his escape from Atlantis. It is the story of Kieko, a lonely Lemurian boy of mixed blood who seeks to know more about his absent father's mysterious Atlantean past. Constantly bullied by Aiko, he eventually takes refuge with the village priest in the Kadek Temple where he studies medicinal and culinary arts, calligraphy, and ultimately, the art of Ki sword. Under the tutelage of the priest he comes to know the grim truth about his father, and is prepared to face the horrific assault of the armies of the Atlantean Empire upon his humble world. And this is just the beginning . . .
