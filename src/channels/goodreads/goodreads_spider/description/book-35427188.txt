35427188:::::Horn-Horn:::::Horn-Horn is definitely a weird name for a town. That s the first thing misfit Cassie Gellar thinks when she learns where her parents are moving them to. Of course, this is the least weird thing that comes with the seaside vista. In a town where the cemetery and art gallery are the same place, a team of vindictive socialite teenage princesses rule the school, a teacher obsessed with creepy garden gnomes teaches them, and a school bus driver is hellbent on killing them all, the vast array of utterly bizarre town residents is going to keep Cassie on her toes. Meanwhile, Zagreus, a Child of Crux, is nestled deep within the Horn-Horn woods, trying his best to move on from his dangerous past. A magical orphan with the power to grant wishes, he is hiding from his previous guardian Ursula, a self-centered woman child from the world of Danube (a planet always hiding behind Pluto). When Cassie discovers Zag in a hollowed-out tree and takes him home before Ursula can get to him, the three lives intertwine in a way nobody could have predicted - with dramatic repercussions for everyone in town. Full of intelligent comedy, fantasy and horror, the constantly evolving 'Horn-Horn' proves that friendship and family can transcend even space and time itself.
