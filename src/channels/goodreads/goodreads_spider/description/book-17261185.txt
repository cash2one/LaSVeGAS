17261185:::::Friends and Traitors:::::The Slayers teens who have powers to fight dragons are back by popular demand in this high-octane sequel, now with a new cover package! Tori is at a White House dinner party when she hears a horrifying sound: dragon eggs hatching. It means in less than a year, the dragons will be mature and dangerous. The Slayers are well-trained, but their group is not yet complete, and Tori is determined to track down Ryker Davis, the mysterious Slayer who has yet to surface. What Tori doesn t bargain for, however, is the surprising truth about her powers: she isn t a Slayer after all, but a Dragon Lord, with a built-in predisposition to protect dragons, not kill them. How will she overcome this to save the lives of her friends?
