7573098:::::The Battle for Rondo:::::Peril awaits Leo and Mimi on their return to the fantastic world of Rondo. With the help of Rondo's seven best witches and wizards, their friends have made plans to combat attacks of the Blue Queen. But it soon becomes clear that defence is no longer enough. The queen has a dragon on her side, and is plotting a terrible revenge on all those who have defied her. A daring plan, a reckless quest and a mysterious prophecy text the friends' wits and courage to the limit as they plunge into an adventure packed with suspense, shocks and danger and ending at last in the battle that will decide Rondo's future forever. Praise for The Key To Rondo: "...a very neatly written distillation of fairytale elements that combine, collapse and reappear like a dream had after an evening spent with the Brothers Grimm, Madame Leprince de Beaumont and Walt Disney. Talking pigs, malevolent ducks and menacing swans bustle through its pages, family mysteries are solved, allies are found and lost, and extravagant evil and deception is punished. Great fun." - Sydney Morning Herald
