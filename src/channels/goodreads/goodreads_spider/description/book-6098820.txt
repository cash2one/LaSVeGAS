6098820:::::The Life of St. Dominic:::::There are few biographies of St. Dominic that exist in English, but this is by far the best. For Augusta Theodosia Drane gives here a rendition of his life, his times, his many miracles and the founding of his order that captures the spirit of the Saint that was Dominic Guzman-a man raised up by God to convert heretics, to save countless souls, and to found an order which would send a spritual tidal wave throughout the Church and around the world, one that would be felt down to our own time and that still influences us all today. The Life of St. Dominic was first published in 1857 in London. The present edition is retypeset from the first part of a two-part work entitled The Life of St. Dominic, with a Sketch of the Dominican Order published by Burns, Oates &amp; Washbourne, c. 1890.
