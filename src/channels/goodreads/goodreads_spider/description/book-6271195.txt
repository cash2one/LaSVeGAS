6271195:::::The Last Pharaoh: Mubarak and the Uncertain Future of Egypt in the Volatile Mid East:::::"Egypt is the next domino to fall and, as they say, so goes Egypt so goes the Middle East.- - Robert Baer, former Middle East-based CIA operative, author of See No Evil and Sleeping with the Devil -Equally alarming is the rise of anti-American and Anti-Semitic conspiracy theories in Egypt-s state media and society. Haunted by the memories of the overnight fall of the Shah of Iran to the Ayatollahs, U.S. policymakers fear a similar event in Egypt. Bush's successor is likely to face an unbelievably bad choice in the largest Arab country. Elaasar-s book is indeed an eye opener- - Swiss News Agency -With so much at stake, the West is slowly coming to grips with a new reality; a reality which no single book or author could possibly address. The Last Pharaoh should be indispensable to anyone hoping to understand Egypt-s role, not only the Middle East, but the potential for Mubarak-s Egypt to impact the destiny of global events-. - The Media Oasis -In this remarkably frank and revealing portrayal of Mubarak-s Egypt, no reader of this book could ever again think of Egypt as anything less than the potential tipping point of Middle Eastern society.- - Syndicated Columnist Ray Hanania " The Last Pharaoh is remarkably thorough. The simplicity of the style and content makes this book required reading for students, journalists, policymakers and general public in order to better understand the mechanisms of authoritarianism and despotism in Egypt." - Political Science Professor, Noureddine Jebnoun, University of Montana.
