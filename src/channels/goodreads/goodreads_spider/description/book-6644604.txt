6644604:::::Hunting with the Heart:::::Hunting with the Heart is a remarkable autobiography of journeys in inner and outer spaces. Graham Saayman writes uncompromisingly of his inner journeys and the confrontation with unconscious forces that take him to the very verge of life. The courage and power to articulate the nature of psychic experience cannot help but inspire readers to realise that a life's journey is not solely in the outer world. But it is Saayman's outer journey through life, professionally and personally, that has the mark of authenticity, that unwavering gaze at life's travails and it's triumphs. The book is in the tradition of other autobiographies, particularly those of Bion and Jung. Because it is, Hunting with the Heart brings a reader close to what life's meanings are all about; the courage to receive the grave dictates of life.
