261000:::::Junie B., First Grader: Toothless Wonder:::::Barbara Park's New York Times bestselling chapter book series, Junie B. Jones, is a classroom favorite and has been keeping kids laughing--and reading--for more than twenty years. Over 60 million copies in print and now with a bright new look for a new generation! Meet the World's Funniest First Grader--Junie B. Jones! One of Junie B.'s top front teeth is loose! Only Junie B. is not that thrilled about this development. Because what if she looks like toothless Uncle Lou? And even worse . . . what's all this tooth fairy business? Like, who is this woman, really? And what does she do with all those used teeth? So many questions, so little time. USA Today "Junie B. is the darling of the young-reader set." Publishers Weekly "Park convinces beginning readers that Junie B.--and reading--are lots of fun."
