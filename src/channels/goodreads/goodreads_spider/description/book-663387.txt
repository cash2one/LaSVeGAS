663387:::::Caught in the Web: A Tale of Tudor Times:::::Following on from the success of the historical novel Under the Scaffold, Faith Cook has taken the content of her acclaimed biography of Lady Jane Grey and crafted a novel around a fictional member of the royal court, but based upon the facts surrounding the life of Lady Jane Grey, focusing particularly upon her Christian faith. This historic novel enables the reader to gain an appreciation of the courage of this young lady and will be an inspiration. Using a narrative form in which some of the characters are fictitious, Faith Cook brings to life for the modern reader a period of English history which was marked by great suffering fo Christians who sought to remain faithful to the truths of the Bible. The account is based first of all on the life of young Lady Jane Grey, nine-day Queen of England, who found herself caught up in a web of intrigue and political ambition, and then on the frightening cruelties which followed during the reign of Mary Tudor. Set against a background of actual historical events, the narrative introduces the reader to many authentic historical figures, often using their own recorded words; both a challenge and encouragement to believers today is provided.
