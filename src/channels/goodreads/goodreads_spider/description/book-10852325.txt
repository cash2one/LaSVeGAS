10852325:::::Anything Else But Love:::::I loved you even before I knew it, The scent of your skin still lingers on my senses, I can see that we are blinded by our natural magnetism towards each other, We are dancing to each others' tunes, rhythmic beats, And still you say that between us there can be 'Anything else but love!' Shewali Singh is a simple, sweet and appealing girl who cares for family and its values. She has just moved to Bangalore to head a project. Always engaged in work, somewhere she has imagined a list of qualities her guy should have. But as her fate would have it, she bumps into a guy who works in the same office as hers. And not only that, he's a flirt, a prankster, who calls himself the Avi Malhotra, who not only misfits the list, but also manages to get a rise out of the generally very easy going Shewali. What follows is, daily fights, gradual friendship, sudden likeness, and then ? All the rules of the artist's sketch of their better half are thus broken. But, what rules do you follow when you start falling in love? Will the phrase "Opposites attract" hold true for them?
