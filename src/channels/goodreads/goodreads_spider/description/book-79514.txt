79514:::::Herbs: The Magic Healers:::::"Health and happiness means to be rid of fatigue and disease. To have a good appetite, good memory, good humor, and precision in thought and action. To be free from anxiety and fear. To have a great capacity for survival over illness and anxieties. To have joy, long life, and great spiritual adventures."

Among the proponents of such natural organic foods were the great Masters of Eckankar, perhaps the first spiritual masters to recognize that healthy bodies aided the concentration necessary to reach God-Realization.
