Between receiving a dreaded invitation to her fifteen year high school reunion, her best friend's divorce drama and her own solitary dating status her fun meter is pretty much pegged. When Taci's partner goes missing while covering a missing child feature she is suddenly thrown into the story of her career, which oddly enough delves into a past she would rather forget. She soon finds herself squaring off against a malicious class Barbie Doll, the High School Quarterback and a steamy Fireman from her past whose deep blue eyes are still enough to curl her toes. It's full speed ahead in this sassy, page turning, first book of the series, where Taci must learn to put the past to rest before she winds up next on the missing person's list.
