30368400:::::Empty Net:::::Spartanburg Spitfires goalie and captain Isaac Drake ended last season with an unexpected trip to the playoffs. He s found a home and family with his coach and mentor, Misha Samarin, and he s looking forward to making a serious run for the Kelly Cup. But things take an interesting turn when Isaac s archnemesis, Laurent St. Savoy, is traded to the Spitfires. After Laurent s despicable behavior in the playoffs last year, Isaac wants nothing to do with him no matter how gorgeous he is. But that changes when Isaac discovers the reason for Laurent s attitude. Laurent St. Savoy grew up the only son of a legendary NHL goalie in a household rife with abuse, constantly treated like a disappointment on and off the ice. When a desperate attempt to escape his father s tyranny sends him to the Spitfires, the last thing Laurent wants is to make friends. But there s something about Isaac Drake that he can t resist, and Laurent has an opportunity to explore his sexuality for the first time, but he s cracking under end-of-the season pressures. When facing the playoffs and a rivalry turned personal vendetta, Isaac s not sure he s enough to hold Laurent or their relationship together.
