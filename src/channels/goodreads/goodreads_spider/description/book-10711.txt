10711:::::God Knows:::::Joseph Heller's powerful, wonderfully funny, deeply moving novel is the story of David--yes, King David, but as you've never seen him before. We already know David as the warrior king of Israel, husband of Bathsheba, and father of Solomon; now meet David, the cocky Jewish kid, the plagiarized poet, the Jewish father. Hear David tell his own story, a story both ancient yet modern, about growing up and growing old, about men and women, and about man and God. It is quintessential Heller.
