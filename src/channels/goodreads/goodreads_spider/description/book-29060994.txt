29060994:::::Megan & Flos: Book 1:::::Megan is the kind of person who is never happier than when she's lost in a book - especially if it's a science fiction book. Flos is the kind of person who loves flowers - she loves the look of them; she loves the smell of them; she loves just lying down among them and breathing them in. At first glance they might seem like unlikely friends but that's not true. They hit it off from the moment they met and are so devoted they would lay down their lives for each other. Hopefully it won't come to that. Megan and Flos are strong, principled females who won't be fobbed off and will get pro-active when no-one else seems to be doing anything. They're kind, they're smart, they're determined to save the planet and, oh yeah, they're telepathic. Megan &amp; Flos - the popular comic from Violet's Veg*n e-Comics - is now here in paperback. Recommended for readers aged 8 and up.
