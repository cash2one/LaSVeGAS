32027656:::::More Than Friends:::::He's not perfect, but he's all I want... I m your average girl at your average high school, trying to figure out my place in life. After catching my now ex-boyfriend messing around with my now ex-best friend, I ve made some big changes. No more band, no more backstabbing friends and no more boring old life. Now I have new friends, a new job and new interests. But there s a certain someone who s interested in me, and I don t get it. Jordan Tuttle could have anyone he wants. He s the most popular boy in school. Rich, gorgeous, smart and the star quarterback, he s perfect. Yet he acts like he wants no one else but me. So despite my fears and doubt, I let him get close. Probably too close. I discover that he s not so perfect after all, but it doesn t matter. I m falling for him, even though he runs so hot and cold. I know someday he s going to break my heart. And I m going to let him.
