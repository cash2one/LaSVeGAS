23255948:::::Alpha Games Volume 1:::::Alpha Games serial - Part 1 Two years ago, curvy she-wolf Aspen ran from her shifter pack and her future as alpha female, where she was expected to choose handsome, blue-eyed Rafe, son of the current alpha, as mate and the next alpha of the pack. Now she s back and living with three sexy former friends and pack mates, including Rafe, who promises to protect her from wolfish advances long enough for her to choose one of three potential future alphas without pressure. Of course Rafe wants Aspen to choose him, and it has nothing to do with wanting to be alpha and everything to do with his feelings for the curvaceous she-wolf. But Aspen doesn't believe that, and it'll take time to convince her. Time Rafe may not have, between a rogue wolf stalking Aspen and Aspen emitting pheromones that are making the other males in the house increasingly desperate to claim her for their own. Important note from the author! Alpha Games is a paranormal romance serial about a female wolf shifter and the three sexy alphas she s destined to choose between. The story is told in novella length episodes with cliffhangers, and is free through Kindle Unlimited. If you aren't getting it that way, I ve priced each part low enough that by the time you have purchased all parts, you ll only have paid the price of one book (99 cents for each part). I know that this format isn t for everyone, but I love serials and find they keep things exciting for me as a writer. I hope you enjoy if you decide to still read it.
