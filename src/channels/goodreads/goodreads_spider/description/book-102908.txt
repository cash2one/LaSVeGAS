102908:::::Beautiful Losers:::::One of the best-known experimental novels of the 1960s, Beautiful Losers is Cohen s most defiant and uninhibited work. The novel centres upon the hapless members of a love triangle united by their sexual obsessions and by their fascination with Catherine Tekakwitha, the 17th-century Mohawk saint. By turns vulgar, rhapsodic, and viciously witty, Beautiful Losers explores each character s attainment of a state of self-abandonment, in which the sensualist cannot be distinguished from the saint.
