18722236:::::Wings of a Sparrow:::::A comedy about football, fortune, and a fanatical fan When Rob Cooper, editor of the anarchic soccer fanzine Wings of a Sparrow , receives the latest in a long line of solicitors letters, he suspects yet another law suit has landed in his lap. Instead, he finds himself slap bang in the middle of a situation the likes of which fans the world over have dreamed about since the birth of the game. He gets the chance to be chairman of his rival football team, giving Rob the chance to do to City what he, as a United supporter, has always dreamt of doing. But when your dreams become a reality, they very quickly take on a very different meaning. Sometimes they can even turn into nightmares. Not simply a tale of revenge and bitterness, this is a light-hearted story of one man, the great game, a small fortune, and a season of personal discovery.
