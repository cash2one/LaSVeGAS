28637637:::::A Lady Unrivaled:::::Lady Ella Myerston can always find a reason to smile even if it's just in hope that tomorrow will be better than today. All her life everyone has tried to protect her from the realities of the world, but Ella knows very well the danger that has haunted her brother and their friend, and she won't wait for it to strike again. She intends to take action . . . and if that happens to involve an adventurous trip to the Cotswolds, then so much the better. Lord Cayton has already broken two hearts, including that of his first wife, who died before he could tell her that he loved her. Now he's determined to be a better person. But that proves difficult when old rakehell friends arrive on the scene and try to threaten him into committing a crime. He does his best to remove the intriguing Lady Ella from danger, but the stubborn girl won't budge. How else can he redeem himself, though, but by saving her and his infant daughter from people ready to destroy them all?
