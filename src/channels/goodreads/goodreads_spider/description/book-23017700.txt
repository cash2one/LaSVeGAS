All right...maybe she does want to get nailed, but that's just because her hottie landlord and local diner owner Mack Ryan is confusing her with his mouth. Can friends become lovers? Especially friends who might not even be friends in the first place? Going Down is the sexy and hilarious first novella in the five-part Wish Upon A Stud series. Each novella is roughly 100 pages with no cliffhanger. Wish Upon A Stud...A happy ending is just a coin toss away.
