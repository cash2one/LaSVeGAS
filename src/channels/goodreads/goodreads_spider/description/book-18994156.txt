18994156:::::Daughter of Asteria:::::After having destroyed the world, Adisia wakes up unaware and disturbed by the sense she's forgetting something. The problem is, she's replaying everything... just in a different way. As soon as her mind catches up and brings her back to the danger still after them, several new disasters occur, each leading Devin to worry about the safety of his only love. With time against them, no one is willing to risk a repeat of the last encounter they had with Safina. Everyone goes all in to prepare, but will it be enough this time? Along the way, Adisia still struggles with her inability to trust the man she loves. It only gets worse in the small world of immortals where Devin is a known womanizer. Then comes a new face, one claiming Adisia is destined to be his, causing Devin's jealousy to surface for a change. Love's never easy for an Aphrodite, cursed by beauty, destroyed by the ones she trusts the most.
