51684:::::Lion's Gaze: A Commentary on Tsig Sum Nedek:::::The most profound and direct teaching of Buddha Shakyamuni's is called Dzogchen, or atiyoga, the Clear Light Great Perfection. This is the culmination of all nine vehicles that form the foundation path. Familiarity with its view, meditation and conduct brings unique results. In "Lion's Gaze", the authors Khenchen Palden Sherab Rinpoche, a highly qualified Lama and Dzogchen Master, and Khenpo Tsewang Dongyal Rinpoche, also a highly qualified Lama, Kama and Terma lineage holder and recognized expert in ancient Tantric literature, gather the teachings and reintroduce their essence in a timeless way. The first part of the book summarizes the history of Dzogchen and notes its lineage masters, illustrated with 15 beautiful portrait line drawings, and continues with explainations of the preliminary practices. The second section begins with "Three Words That Strike The Crucial Point", written by 8th century Vidyadhara Garab Dorje, the first human teacher of Dzogchen. This three line text is followed by Master Patrul Rinpoche's famous commentary entitled, "The Special Teaching of The Wise and Glorious Sovereign", written in the 19th century. The original Tibetan with English translations are provided for all original texts.
