491944:::::How to Ruin a Summer Vacation:::::Moshav? What s a moshav? Is it shopping mall in Hebrew? I mean, from what Jessica was telling me, Israeli stores have the latest fashions from Europe. That black dress Jessica has is really awesome. I know I d be selling out if I go with the Sperm Donor to a mall, but I keep thinking about all the great stuff I could bring back home. Unfortunately for 16-year-old Amy Nelson, moshav is not Hebrew for shopping mall. Not even close. Think goats, not Gucci. Going to Israel with her estranged Israeli father is the last thing Amy wants to do this summer. She s got a serious grudge against her dad, a.k.a. Sperm Donor, for showing up so rarely in her life. Now he s dragging her to a war zone to meet a family she s never known, where she ll probably be drafted into the army. At the very least, she ll be stuck in a house with no AC and only one bathroom for seven people all summer no best friend, no boyfriend, no shopping, no cell phone Goodbye pride hello Israel.
