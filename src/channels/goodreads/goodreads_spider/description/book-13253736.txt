13253736:::::Darkness Rising:::::In the aftermath of the Battle of the Elven Woods, the two legends of Marithian prophecy are both dangerously close to the dark grip of death as Marithia suffers under the powers of the Blood Red Moon. Vartan, prophesised to save Marithia, lays spellbound under the protection of the mythical dragons. The vampire sorceress Kassina, prophesised to bring about their Armageddon has been moved to the underworld by the demon lord himself, Shindar. A seed of the gods has grown and their greatest gift to Marithians, Anakari, makes her fated journey to discover her purpose.

Talonsphere must be found before Marithia merges with the Underworld and Shindar brings about the world's end
