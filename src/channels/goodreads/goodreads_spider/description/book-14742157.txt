14742157:::::Buddhist Boot Camp Manuscript:::::Buddhism is all about training the mind, and boot camp is an ideal training method for this generation's short attention span. The chapters in this small book can be read in any order, and are short and easy to understand. Each story, inspirational quote and teaching offers mindfulness-enhancing techniques that anyone can relate to. It is very possible (and perfectly okay) for people who are Catholic, Muslim or Jewish, for example, to still find the Buddha's teachings motivational. As the Dalai Lama says, "Don't try to use what you learn from Buddhism to be a Buddhist; use it to be a better whatever-you-already-are." There is absolutely no reason to argue over which religion came "first" or whose philosophy is "better". The important thing is to be kind, understanding, peaceful, patient and compassionate, which is actually fundamental in all religions. Whether it's Mother Teresa's acts of charity, Gandhi's perseverance, or your aunt Betty's calm demeanor, it doesn't matter who inspires you, so long as you're motivated to be better today than you were yesterday. Regardless of religion or geographical region, race, ethnicity, color, gender, sexual orientation, age, ability, flexibility or vulnerability, if you do good, you feel good, and if you do bad, you feel bad. Amen! Hallelujah! And all that Jazz! If you agree that Buddhism isn't just about meditating, but also about rolling up your sleeves to actually relieve some of the suffering in the world, then become a fan on Facebook (and a follower on Twitter) to meet other like-minded-folks for beach cleanup events, feeding the homeless, caring for the elderly, community yoga, cooking classes, tutoring, or anything we can each do to help others. You're now a soldier of peace in the army of love; welcome to Buddhist Boot Camp!
