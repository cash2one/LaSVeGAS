27474810:::::Safe at Home:::::Driven by fear and desperate to protect her family, Samantha is forced to leave Chicago and everything she's worked to achieve, only to start over by tossing a dart-at-the-map. The Georgia townsfolk's true Southern charm is the unexpected prescription needed to heal her soul, and the sexy carpenter who touches her heart are distractions she didn't plan on, but they might offer her a chance at a new life, if she can let go of her past. Town heartbreaker Spencer Malloy isn't looking for anything serious. His days are perfect working as a contractor, attending his nephew's baseball games, or taking him fishing. He never expects to fall for the big city girl, Samantha. She's not his type, timid and closed off, but in her unguarded moments, he's intrigued by the woman he can't get out of his mind. The urge to get closer to her grows stronger each day, and when the shadow of evil resurfaces, he vows to protect Samantha, even if it means abandoning his home and joining her on the run. When confronted by the man who's bent on revenge, Samantha must choose between running again to save the people she loves, or, if she has the strength, to stay and fight for her new life.
