6581129:::::The Tragedy of Hamlet:::::George Lyman Kittredge s insightful editions of Shakespeare have endured in part because of his eclecticism, his diversity of interests, and his wide-ranging accomplishments, all of which are reflected in the valuable notes in each volume.

Features of each edition include: The introduction to the original Kittredge Edition Editor s Introduction to the Focus Edition. An overview on major themes of the plays, and sections on the play s performance history on stage and screen. Explanatory Notes.

Performance notes. These appear separately and immediately below the textual footnotes and include discussions of noteworthy stagings of the plays, issues of interpretation, and film and stage choices. How to read the play as Performance Section.
