19380557:::::Azlander: Second Nature:::::Puck is an Elven prince who was formerly known as Robin of the Forest (Robin Hood/Robyn Hode). He falls in love with a mortal girl and follows her soul into the Heavens and beyond ... AZLANDER tells of the spiritual worlds - of dark and glorious beings that crowd the spaces. There is the vaguest shimmer of true Faerie that lightly touches the pages, whereupon the astute may catch a glimpse as the thoughts become enlivened by its words. Two men, one the immortal Puck, and one a mortal man - and a single girl - are all stalked by a Demonic Master who seeks to own the earthly realm through his tinkering in the virtual worlds. Can Puck help save Humanity from the dark being who threatens to control the globe? And who may save Puck? - His dear friend Paracelsus? The Tribunal of Horus? Or the guidance of the Azlan himself?
