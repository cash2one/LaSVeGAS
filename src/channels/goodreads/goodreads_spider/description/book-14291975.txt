14291975:::::The Reason:::::When facing the impossible, will you believe? Storm clouds gather over a small Michigan town. As thunder shakes the sky, the lights inside St. Thomas Church flicker . . . and then go out. All is black until a thick bolt of lightning slices the sky, striking the church s large wooden cross leaving it ablaze and splintered in two. When the storm ends the search for answers begins. James Lindy, the church s blind minister, wonders how his small congregation can repair the cross and keep their faith in the midst of adversity. And he hears the words only believe. Macey Lewis, the town s brilliant young oncologist, is drawn to Alex, a young boy who s recently been diagnosed with an aggressive leukemia. She puts her hope in modern medicine yet is challenged to only believe. And Alex s single mom, who has given everything she can to her boy, is pleading with God to know the reason this is happening . . . to save her son. But she only hears silence and wonders how she can possibly only believe. The Reason is a milestone debut novel, opening with a thunderbolt and never letting up as it introduces us to everyday characters who are wrestling with the questions: Where is God when bad things happen? And does God ignore the prayers of the faithful? The answer each character receives will astound readers while offering an unforgettable call to hope, to change, to . . . only believe. This is a skillfully written first novel with the narrative voice, knack for dialogue, and plot movement of a veteran author. Publishers Weekly
