The Russos look like an average family: Mom and Dad run a Manhattan deli, while their kids, Alex, Justin, and Max, deal with school, friendships, and first dates. But things are not exactly as they seem because these kids are all wizards in training! To make things more complicated, only one of them will remain a wizard after the age of 18. Talk about sibling rivalry! Full of the magic, comedy, and fun that you've come to expect from Disney Channel, this series is sure to continue conjuring a smash hit. Wizards of Waverly Place #4: Spellbound Best friends Alex and Harper get invited to rude 'n' rotten Gigi's annual tea party, and to Alex's horror, Harper is psyched to go! But when Alex learns Gigi's game plan is to humiliate Harper, she decides she too will pop in to the tea-and use her magic to give Gigi an education in embarrassment. Plus, after casting a spell to help Harper with her Waverly Sub Station job, Alex battles the backlash from her magical misuse.
