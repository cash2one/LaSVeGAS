629623:::::Heartbreaker:::::While vacationing in Utah s mountain wilderness, Lynn Nelson suddenly finds herself having to deal with her teenage daughter Rory s raging hormones. The object of Rory s passion is their guide, drop-dead gorgeous Jess Feldman, a man the divorced Lynn instinctively distrusts, even as she shields herself from his blazing baby blues. But after Lynn and Rory fall off a cliff of sheared rock, Jess becomes their only hope.

Exhausted and injured, all they have is one another a terrified child, and a man and a woman who rediscover passion in each other s arms as they race against time for their lives.
