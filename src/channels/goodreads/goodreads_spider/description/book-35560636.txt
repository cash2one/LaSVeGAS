35560636:::::Lucky Number Eleven:::::I ve always been the person that does whatever someone tells me I can t. Can t graduate with a four-point-oh? Check. Can t win a modeling contract without trying? Did it. Check. Can t make it in the pro football league? Triple check with an MVP Award on top. When my best friend told me to stay away from his little sister, Layla, it didn t sound like a challenge. Then again, I d never seen her before. He obviously wasn t thinking about who he was talking to if he believed I could ignore her. I obviously wasn t thinking of him at all when I fell in love with her either. Fact of the matter is: I not only fell harder than a quarterback sack on a Sunday night game, but I did us one better. Kind of like that MVP award, only not so shiny. Sort of like my Player of the Year title, except the only thing I m walking away with is an ex-best friend and a woman that hates my guts. It s okay. Just tell me I can t win her back. I m Branch Lucky Best and today s my lucky day. Lucky Number Eleven is a STANDALONE NOVEL.
