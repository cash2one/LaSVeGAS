34327331:::::More Than Need You:::::I m Griffin Reed cutthroat entrepreneur and competitive bastard. Trust is a four-letter word and everyone is disposable except Britta Stone. Three years ago, she was my everything before I stupidly threw her away. I thought I d paid for my sin in misery until I learned we have a son. Finding out she s engaged to a bore who s rushing her to the altar pisses me off even more. I intend to win her back and raise our boy. I ll have to get ruthless, of course. Luckily, that s one of my most singular talents. Sixty days. That s what I m asking the gritty, independent single mother to give me twenty-four/seven. Under my roof. And if I have my way, in my bed. Britta says she wants nothing to do with me. But her body language and passionate kisses make her a liar. Now all I have to do is coax her into surrendering to the old magic between us. Once I have her right where I want her, I ll do whatever it takes to prove I more than need her.
