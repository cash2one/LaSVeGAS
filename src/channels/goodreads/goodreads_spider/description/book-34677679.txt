34677679:::::Rock Stars Are a Trope:::::[Siren Allure: Erotic Contemporary Romance, light bondage, sex toys, HFN] Gabby Denis, a struggling fashion designer, is not stupid. There is something off about Nate Cooper. She just doesn't know what it is. Not many men are willing to take a girl out shopping and pay for her new clothes. She's also never been out with a man who seems to have women recognize him. Or one with friends that need a formal dress made. Of course, she doesn't turn down the chance to make it! Gabby likes Nate for who he is, not because he lends her a car and pays for some of her things. For the first time in ages, she meets someone who supports her, and she genuinely enjoys his company. But he never tells her what he does for a living...until she sees him on the front page of the news. Although, for Gabby, rock stars are a trope from movies and romance novels, she's going to have to decide if she's willing to give a real life one a shot at loving. ** A Siren Erotic Romance
