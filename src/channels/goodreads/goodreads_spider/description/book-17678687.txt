17678687:::::The Story of My Making:::::In a few short hundred years, man had destroyed that which took the Mother many millennia to create. Most were deaf to her pleas, but Mana answered, and those in touch with Mother Earth became the 'tel. They survived the Earth being scoured clean, leaving behind a fresh canvas on which to paint the future. Ka'mana, Mana's shamanic apprentice, tells the tale of an immortal race of shape-shifters who have maintained harmony with the land for a thousand years. Their Oath to protect Mother Earth leads them to rescue a downtrodden slave girl. The more they learn about her, the deeper they are dragged into a sinister world where humans have re-emerged, and driven by a pain-addicted God, have become a cancer, consuming everything around them. Within one turning of Grandmother Moon, Ka'mana's life is irrevocably shattered, forcing her past the edge of sanity, not a good trait in a telepath with unlimited power.
