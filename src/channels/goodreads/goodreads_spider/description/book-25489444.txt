25489444:::::For Cheddar or Worse:::::In the new Cheese Shop Mystery from the Agatha Award-winning author of As Gouda as Dead , an extra-sharp tongued cheese critic is cut down during a summer cheese festival. It s time for the annual Cheese Festival in Providence, Ohio, and Charlotte Bessette s cheese shop is packed with homemade specialties. Meanwhile, her friend Erin is prepping her dairy farm and inn for cheese makers, marketers, journalists, and one surprise guest Lara Berry, pretentious cheese whiz, pompous bestselling author, and pungent critic whose extra sharp tongue can crumble a reputation. Even though any love for Lara by her friends curdled long ago, Charlotte is surprised when the foodie is smothered to death in her room at Erin s inn. Accusations start flying, but the one laying blame on Erin strikes Charlotte as a crock. Now, to clear her friend s name, Charlotte has to sift through Lara s ex-lovers, former business partners, and unforgiving enemies to find a killer before Lara s past casts a tainted pall on the festival s future.
