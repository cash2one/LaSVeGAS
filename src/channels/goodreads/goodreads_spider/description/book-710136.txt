710136:::::Goodbye, I Love You:::::Good-bye, I Love You is the true story of a wife, her homosexual husband, and a love that transcended tragedy when he came home to die. First released in hardcover in 1986, Good-bye, I Love You was the first widely acclaimed memoir of what was to become a continuing tragedy: death resulting from the AIDS virus. Since problems related to AIDS take an ever-increasing toll, the continuing popularity of Pearson's book is no surprise. It may be that no one has documented the heart-wrenching effects of homosexuality and the AIDS epidemic on the American family better than Ms. Pearson.
