15954310:::::Feral Sins:::::When female wolf shifter Taryn Warner first encounters Trey Coleman, an alpha male wolf shifter with a dangerous reputation, she s determined to resist his charms. After all, Trey who was only fourteen when he defeated his own father in a duel, winning the right to be alpha of his pack can t have anything to offer the talented healer besides trouble, or so she thinks. Taryn finds herself drawn in by Trey s forceful demeanor and arctic-blue eyes, and she eventually agrees to enter an uneasy alliance with him. If the two succeed in convincing their respective packs that they ve chosen each other as mates, Trey will win valuable political allies, while Taryn will escape an odious arranged mating. But there are a lot of potential pitfalls to this plan including the very real possibility that the wolf shifters, overwhelmed by their growing attraction to each other, will be unable to maintain the clear heads needed to pull off the deception.
