161768:::::King Kong:::::Introduction by Greg Bear Preface by Mark Cotta Vaz The giant prehistoric gorilla King Kong is one of the most recognized images in our culture. So great is the mighty Kong s hold on the popular imagination that his story a gripping yarn of man versus nature, coupled with a fantastical update of the Beauty and the Beast legend has been thrice made into a motion picture (most recently in 2005) and referenced endlessly in every medium, from books to prime-time sitcoms. Beneath King Kong s cultural significance, however, is a tense and surprisingly tender story. One cannot help but be frightened by Kong s uncontrollable fury, be saddened over the giant s capture, mistreatment, and exploitation by venal showmen, or sympathize with the beast s ill-fated affection for the down-on-her-luck starlet Ann Darrow. This Modern Library edition of a true colossus among adventure stories is reprinted from the original 1932 novelization of the movie script, and includes a Preface by Mark Cotta Vaz, the preeminent biographer of Merian C. Cooper, producer of the original 1933 classic film. From the Trade Paperback edition.
