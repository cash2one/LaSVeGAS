355704:::::Such a Perfect Sister:::::Yet another of Phoebe Redmond's friends is getting married and once again, as bridesmaid, she must suffer the mortification of a taffeta frock that does nothing for her figure. As if she didn't have enough problems, her job as sous chef at a smart bar and restaurant is like working in a war zone under the command of a psychopath. To cap it all, the man she wants, Luke, is dating someone else, and it happens to be her dazzling sister Alex. It's tough. It's even tougher because she suspects that Alex isn't really in love with Luke at all. Then Alex rashly accepts Luke's proposal and Phoebe must don taffeta once more. But Phoebe's not the only one let down in love. One evening, into the restaurant walks Will, all dressed up with nowhere to go. He's just come from a wedding his own where the bride jilted him at the altar.
