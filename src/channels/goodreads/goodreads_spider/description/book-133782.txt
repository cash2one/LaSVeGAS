133782:::::The Sunflower: On the Possibilities and Limits of Forgiveness:::::While imprisoned in a Nazi concentration camp, Wiesenthal was taken one day from his work detail to the bedside of a dying SS man. Haunted by the crimes in which he'd participated, the soldier wanted to confess to--&amp; obtain absolution from--a Jew. Faced with the choice between compassion &amp; justice, silence &amp; truth, Wiesenthal said nothing. But even years after the war had ended, he wondered: Had he done the right thing? What would you have done in his place? In this important book, 53 distinguished men &amp; women respond to Wiesenthal's questions. They are theologians, political leaders, writers, jurists, psychiatrists, human rights activists, Holocaust survivors &amp; victims of attempted genocides in Bosnia, Cambodia, China &amp; Tibet. Their responses, as varied as their experiences of the world, remind us that Wiesenthal's questions are not limited to events of the past. Often surprising, always thought provoking, The Sunflower will challenge you to define your beliefs about justice, compassion &amp; responsibility.
