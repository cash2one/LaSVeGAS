Instead, I feel my face go hot. Silence stretches as wide as an ocean. When I look up, Felicity has this expression on her face like she's just seen Elvis. Slowly, she leans forward and in a gentle voice I've never heard her use before she says, 'Have you done a pregnancy test?' When Hedda discovers she is pregnant, she doesn t believe she could ever look after a baby. The numbers just don t add up. She is young, and still in the grip of an eating disorder that controls every aspect of how she goes about her daily life. She s even given her eating disorder a name Nia. But as the days tick by, Hedda comes to a decision: she and Nia will call a truce, just until the baby is born. 17 weeks, 119 days, 357 meals. She can do it, if she takes it one day at a time Heartbreaking and hopeful by turns, Karen Gregory s debut novel is a story of love, heartache and human resilience. And how the things that matter most can t be counted. Perfect for fans of Lisa Williamson, Non Pratt and Sarah Crossan.
