In "Waiting for Kate Bush", the reader will not only laugh out loud at Herskovits' attempt to make sense of his life in an alien culture, but also learn in detail what Kate Bush - known alternately as 'the barmiest bird in pop', 'the pre Raphaelite mymph with Minnie Mouse's soprano' and the 'greatest artist of the last 30 years' has been up to in the silent decade - plus - since the release of her last album.
