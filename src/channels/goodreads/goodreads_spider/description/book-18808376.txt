18808376:::::Rio's World:::::Rio's World Riona Marionette is a girl with a strange past that haunts her in the form of gut-wrenching nightmares. She tries to put it behind her and enjoy life, traveling with her basketball team, but is soon reminded of the fact that things never go as planned... Victore Deville. Even his name sounded deadly. Ever since the mysterious all-too-perfect specimen of male had shown up with his intense glares and infuriating comments, Riona had lost all control of her own emotions and thoughts. Hoping he wouldn't notice his effect on her, Rio used her sharp wit and sarcasm to keep him at bay, however, much to her dismay, here was the only person who wasn't thrown off by her humour. As the only girl competing in an all boys basketball tournament, you'd think Rio would have enough problems. Add to that the crude nightmares, almost romances, crazy teammates, dramatic cheerleaders, hilarious moments and mysterious events, and you've got... Rio's World.
