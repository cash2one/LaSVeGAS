18114266:::::Mary Coin:::::Bestselling author Marisa Silver takes Dorothea Lange s Migrant Mother photograph as inspiration for a story of two women one famous and one forgotten and their remarkable chance encounter. In 1936, a young mother resting by the side of the road in central California is spontaneously photographed by a woman documenting migrant laborers in search of work. Few personal details are exchanged and neither woman has any way of knowing that they have produced one of the most iconic images of the Great Depression. In present day, Walker Dodge, a professor of cultural history, stumbles upon a family secret embedded in the now-famous picture. In luminous prose, Silver creates an extraordinary tale from a brief event in history and its repercussions throughout the decades that follow a reminder that a great photograph captures the essence of a moment yet only scratches the surface of a life.
