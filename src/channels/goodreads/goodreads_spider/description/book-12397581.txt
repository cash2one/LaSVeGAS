12397581:::::Next of Kin:::::Beth Venable has seen too much... Witness to a major mob hit, she's placed in protective custody until the trial. But after her third safe house is riddled with bullets, she goes off-grid to save herself. What the FBI can't do, her kinfolk will. The beautiful but forbidding Appalachian Mountains of Kentucky welcome Beth back, dirt roads and rustic shacks a world apart from L.A. But her homecoming - even her blissful reunion with strong, silent Ryal Walker - is made bittersweet by the fight she's brought to the clan's doorstep. Hidden in a remote cabin with the man she's always wanted, Beth begins to dream of a new life: her old one. But after so long, with such dangers stalking her... impossible. But love can distil life down to its essence: an elixir of pure hope, nerve, and the will to survive.
