18513828:::::Miracles & Merits of Allah's Messenger - Al Bidayah VI:::::Darussalam is proud to present the abridged English translation of the classic work: Al-Bidayah wan Nihayah. This book focus on the events that took place after the death of Messenger of Allah, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, such as the choosing of Abu Bakr as the Caliph, the ghusl of Prophet, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, and his burial. The book then discusses the blessed and beautiful characteristics and merits of the Prophet and then goes on to describe the miracles that he performed. Ibn Katheer then compares the miracles given to Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, with those that were given to other prophets; he then shows that Prophet Muhammad, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him, collectively received the same miracles that were granted to other Prophets separately. Al-Bidayah wan Nihayah (The Beginning and The End) by the renowned scholar Abu Al-Fida Imad ad-Deen Isma eel bin Umar ibn Katheer, is considered one of the most authoritative sources of Islamic history.
