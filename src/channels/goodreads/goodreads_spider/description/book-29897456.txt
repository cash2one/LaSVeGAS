29897456:::::Luke Walker: Animal Stick Up For-Er:::::Luke Walker is an eight year old boy with a mind of his own. He's noticed that life often isn't fair for non-human animals; and that what adults tell him sometimes doesn't make sense. Wanting to right wrongs, he becomes a vegetarian outlaw who will not play by the rules if the rules mean being unkind. He knows he's right but he also knows that, in order to do the right thing, he sometimes needs to be sneaky. These first eight chapters of Luke Walker's adventures sticking up for animals are funny, inspiring, and very entertaining. Great mischief, great adventures, great fun! Luke Walker is a vegan 'Just William'. Suitable for children aged 8 and up to read alone, or for reading to younger children.
