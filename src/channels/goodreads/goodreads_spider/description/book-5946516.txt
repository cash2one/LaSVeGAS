Conductors in Conversation: The Complete Collection is an amalgamation of two books now out of print, Conversations with Conductors (1976) and Conductors in Conversation (1990), both published by Robson Books and described by one reviewer as "a prime example of what any music book should offer". Author Robert Chesterman's interviews with conductors as celebrated as Leonard Bernstein, Claudio Abbado and Herbert von Karajan present fresh insights into their individual characters, their personal ideologies and their practical approaches - and in many cases, their private lives - as well as into classical music in general. For this new edition, Chesterman has re-edited the entire contents, updated information on the conductors, added a further chapter on Rafael Kubelik, incorporated fascinating rare photographs and written a compelling new introduction. This resulting volume is an indispensible addition to the bookshelves of musicians, students, journalists, academics, lovers of classical music and any scholars who need to know something about 20th century music history. There is captivating new biographical information on the conductors, their teachers and their mentors - all in the easily-readable form of conversational Q &amp; A, which gives the reader a true sense of intimacy with these musical powerhouses while enlivening the sometimes-staid world of classical music journalism.
