542712:::::Soul Surfer: A True Story of Faith, Family, and Fighting to Get Back on the Board:::::They say Bethany Hamilton has saltwater in her veins. How else could one explain the passion that drives her to surf? How else could one explain that nothing not even the loss of her arm could come between her and the waves? That Halloween morning in Kauai, Hawaii, Bethany responded to the shark s stealth attack with the calm of a girl with God on her side. Pushing pain and panic aside, she began to paddle with one arm, focusing on a single thought: Get to the beach.... And when the first thing Bethany wanted to know after surgery was When can I surf again? it became clear that her spirit and determination were part of a greater story a tale of courage and faith that this soft-spoken girl would come to share with the world. Soul Surfer is a moving account of Bethany s life as a young surfer, her recovery after the attack, the adjustments she s made to her unique surfing style, her unprecedented bid for a top showing in the World Surfing Championships, and, most fundamentally, her belief in God. It is a story of girl power and spiritual grit that shows the body is no more essential to surfing perhaps even less so than the soul.
