They have undisclosed evidence she has been having an affair with a society artist plus the fact that a quantity of arsenic has been found in the judgeOCOs body. She appeals for help to McLevy though the case is not in his parish; there is an ambivalent quality to her, an elusive attraction that the Inspector canOCOt resist.

McLevy finds the answer but will justice be done?"
