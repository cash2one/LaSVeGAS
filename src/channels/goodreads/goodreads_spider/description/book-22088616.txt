I know that statement makes no sense at first glance but I will do my best to explain what is, to me, alien at best. Sometimes it takes great planning and care to get the moment just right. And sometimes it s better if you just man up and do it. You might enter into it thinking, What s the worst thing that can happen? And sometimes the worst thing surprises you. But every once in awhile, every once in a blue moon, magic happens. These stories are like that like both that s." - D.B. Tarpley
