11563:::::Danse Macabre:::::The author whose boundless imagination &amp; storytelling powers have redefined the horror genre, from 1974's Carrie to his newest epic, reflects on the very nature of terror--what scares us &amp; why--in films (both cheesy &amp; choice), tv &amp; radio, &amp;, of course, the horror novel, past &amp; present. Informal, engaging, tremendous fun &amp; tremendously informative, Danse Macabre is an essential tour with the master of horror as your guide; much like his spellbinding works of fiction, you won't be able to put it down.
