1318645:::::Dragon's Bait:::::Falsely accused of witchcraft, 15-year-old Alys is staked out on a hillside and left as sacrificial bait for a hungry dragon. It's cold. And dark. And raining. And Alys is thoroughly alone. Even when she breaks free of her bindings, there's nowhere for her to go. If she tries to return to her village, the people of St. Toby's will simply stake her out again. Alys hears wolves howling in the distance. Then she sees the shadow of the dragon coursing across the moon. The question is...does the dragon see Alys?
