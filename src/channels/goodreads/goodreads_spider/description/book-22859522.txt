It celebrates the ones we hear nothing of: the brave women whose hearts and minds were broken by a life of bitter hardship. A &amp;#8220;homesman&amp;#8221; must be found to escort a handful of them back East to a sanitarium. When none of the county&amp;#8217;s men steps up, the job falls to Mary Bee Cuddy&amp;#8212;ex-teacher, spinster, indomitable and resourceful. Brave as she is, Mary Bee knows she cannot succeed alone. The only companion she can find is the low-life claim jumper George Briggs. Thus begins a trek east, against the tide of colonization, against hardship, Indian attacks, ice storms, and loneliness&amp;#8212;a timeless classic told in a series of tough, fast-paced adventures. In an unprecedented sweep, Glendon Swarthout&amp;#8217;s novel won both the Western Writers of America&amp;#8217;s Spur Award and the Western Heritage Wrangler Award. A new afterword by the author&amp;#8217;s son Miles Swarthout tells of his parents Glendon and Kathryn&amp;#8217;s discovery of and research into the lives of the oft-forgotten frontier women who make The Homesman as moving and believable as it is unforgettable.
