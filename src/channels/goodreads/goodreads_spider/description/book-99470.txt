99470:::::Five Plays:::::Includes: - The Misanthrope - Tartuffe - The School for Wives - The Miser - The Hypochondriac This volume brings together five of Moliere's finest and best-known plays. The three verse plays, The Misanthrope, Tartuffe and The School for Wives, have been skilfully turned into sparkling English couplets by Richard Wilbur's 'brilliant rhymed translation' Sunday Telegraph; while the playwright Alan Drury has translated the two prose comedies, The Miser and The Hypochondriac ('a cherubically funny translation' Independent).
