8642793:::::The Death of the Adversary:::::Written while Hans Keilson was in hiding during World War II, The Death of the Adversary is the self-portrait of a young man helplessly fascinated by an unnamed adversary whom he watches rise to power in 1930s Germany. It is a tale of horror, not only in its evocation of Hitler s gathering menace but also in its hero s desperate attempt to discover logic where none exists. A psychological fable as wry and haunting as Badenheim 1939 , The Death of the Adversary is a lost classic of modern fiction.
