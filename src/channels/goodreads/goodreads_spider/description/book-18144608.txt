18144608:::::Let It Be Me:::::Do you see that woman there? The one with long, wavy blond hair and blue eyes that used to sparkle? That s me, Violet Moore. Do you see those men over there? One is my husband, Rob. A man who claimed he loved me, but proved his fist loved me more. The other is Tucker McCloud, my savior and confidant. I'm torn between what's right and my own fear. But not anymore. I m taking my life back now. I will fight back. I will be happy.
