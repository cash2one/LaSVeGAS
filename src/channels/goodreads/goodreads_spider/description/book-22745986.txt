Through Lily and Benny's persistent pestering, they convince the three men that Caitlin did not run off with a "lover" but has actually disappeared into thin air. Lily and Benny are convinced that their Aunt Birdie may be deeply involved in Caitlin's disappearance.

Everywhere Lily and Benny go, suspicious characters seem to pop up but Sheriff Beaumont's interest seems to be focused on other things. That is until the pieces of the puzzle start falling together.
