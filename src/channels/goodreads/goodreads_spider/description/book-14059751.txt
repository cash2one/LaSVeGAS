14059751:::::Lady Be Bad:::::Meet Marlayna, a woman determined to get answers in Lady Be Bad When the invitation arrived, Marlayna O'Brian was stunned. There was her ex-husband's name attached to both an engagement announcement and the opening of Kingman Castle, Jorstadt Island, in the St. Lawrence. Noah Drake walked out of her life without a word - just divorce papers. She wanted answers and he was the only man who could provide them. When Marlayna RSVP'd she had only one aim in mind: to be in Noah's arms again - no matter what she had to do to get there. She gave him fair warning: "Seduction is the plan for today. Keep on your toes, Mr. Drake. You never know when or where I'm going to strike!"
