15846851:::::The Vampire's Release:::::Her hair smelled like ripe oranges. It teased and beckoned me forward. I came to stand beside her and took one of the gently waving amber locks into my fist. Her head turned towards me, but she closed her brilliant eyes and let her lashes sweep over whatever emotion that might have been blooming inside her head. Without real intent, my fingers left her hair and touched her chin. Why do you close your eyes? You frighten the hell out of me, Michael. Sarah and Michael have faced deadly challenges. He gave himself over to his worst enemy to save her life. When an old friend comes to his rescue, her methods may bring an end to the Michael that Sarah Wood has come to love. The secret to his release may give rise to a lethal monster who poses the greatest threat that Sarah has ever faced. This fourth book in the series contains language that some might find offensive, sexual scenarios not appropriate for children and violent situations. It is roughly the same length as the other books in the series (36,788 words as calculated in Microsoft Word 2010.)
