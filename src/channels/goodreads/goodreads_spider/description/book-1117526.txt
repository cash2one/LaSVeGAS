1117526:::::The Book of Useless Information:::::What you may so cavalierly call useless information could prove invaluable to someone else. Then again, maybe not. But to The Useless Information Society, any fact that passes its gasp-inducing, not-a-lot-of-people-know-that test merits inclusion in this fascinating but ultimately useless book... Did you know (or do you care)... - That fish scales are used to make lipstick? - Why organized crime accounts for ten percent of the United States's annual income? - The name of the first CD pressed in the United States? - The last year that can be written upside-down or right side-up and appear the same? - The shortest performance ever nominated for an Oscar(R)? - How much Elvis weighed at the time of his death? - What the suits in a deck of cards represent? - How many Quarter Pounders can be made from one cow? - How interesting useless information can be? The Book of Useless Information answers these teasers and is packed with facts and figures that will captivate you--and anyone who shares your joy in the pursuit of pointless knowledge.
