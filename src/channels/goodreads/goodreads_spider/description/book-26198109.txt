26198109:::::Louder Than a Whisper: Clearer Than a Bell:::::Louder Than a Whisper; Clearer Than a Bell challenges the status quo of Humanity by inviting it to look at the morass of confusion, despair and uncertainty that pervade our society. Through a series of heartfelt essays this book examines topics such as Pride , Desire , Responsibility , Betrayal and Loneliness . What are they and how do they influence our lives? These topics go deeply inside the human psyche to places many are reticent to visit. We re uncertain about what we might uncover and let s be honest, in a world that s way too busy, it s inconvenient to invest our time on uncertainties. If we have nagging doubts about the purpose of our lives - most of us do - then surely these deserve investigation rather than a disinterested response of Whatever . We already know the consequences of ignoring what s happening in our world; more war, more control, more crime, more hatred and more separation - only we can change it. The journey we must all one day undertake begins within us and only through this journey will we discover our true nature. Fear creates the roadblock that prevents us from taking that first bold step to changing our world; fear of the unknown. The challenge is to overcome this fear and the inertia of getting started. As with 'Just Around The Bend', only paperback versions of this book are illustrated.
