That day, she believed, was the day that she had been cursed with the uncanny ability to locate lost items, people and things, but never to be able to find things she had lost herself. Tossed around from home to home, because no one wants her around, Amy is placed under the care of an old German man named, Mr. Heckler. There Amy finds, a lost baby deer, a home, and a chance of a new life. Given a list of lost items to locate, Amy sets out to prove her abilities, only to find herself a pawn of power, in a very dangerous game of seek and find, where desperate individuals will stop at nothing until she has found every secret, and dug up every treasure the town has. FLOTSAM, is an adventure story that tells of forgiveness, and hope, of shipwrecked lives, and of those amazing coastguards of life who take the time to find us when we are lost.
