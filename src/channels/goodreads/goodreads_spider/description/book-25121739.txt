25121739:::::House of Royals:::::Every town has its history and skeletons, but Silent Bend, Mississippi s are darker than most. Ruled from the shadows by the House the immortal Born and their aging, enslaved Bitten everyone knows not to go out after dark and that the police will never look into crimes involving blood. Alivia Ryan didn t know the man who claims to be her father through a will even existed until she inherits the Conrath plantation. Instead of the sleepy house she expects, she finds a mansion and a staff who look at her with fear in their eyes. Ian Ward tried to kill Alivia the first time they met, and then insisted he train her to defend herself against the House, who he claims will try to manipulate and take her in for their own political reasons. And the growing attraction between them will threaten their lives Ian is a sworn enemy of the House. In Silent Bend, people disappear, the threat of a demented King and the legend of his resurrecting Queen hang over everyone s heads, and proving loyalty means far more than blood. You d better watch who you trust in this town
