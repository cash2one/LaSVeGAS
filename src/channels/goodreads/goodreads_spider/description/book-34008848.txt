34008848:::::The Last Confession:::::Since she was a child, Maggie Callahan has been intrigued by the family legend that her great aunt shot a priest. But family members have never been able to tell her why-or what happened to the priest. But now that she's a career journalist, Maggie decides to use her investigative skills to find out the truth behind her family's scandal. Knowing only that the event happened in the mid-1930s, during the building of the Grand Coulee Dam, Maggie begins her quest with the bishop of the Archdiocese of Spokane. She quickly discovers that he, like so many others, will do whatever it takes to keep any hint of dishonor behind locked doors and to protect the Catholic Church. But Maggie finds an unlikely ally in Father Matthew, a parish priest who has been given the task of stalling her. The Last Confession deftly explores the twin mysteries of romance and faith in a story of past and present love affairs that both test a priest's commitment to his vow of celibacy. Ultimately, will the truth about her ancestor's sins be the key that unlocks Maggie's future?
