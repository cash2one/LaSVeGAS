20830845:::::Fallen Beloved:::::When a small town journalist stumbles upon a local story of an elderly man with unearthly healing powers, he gets into more than bargained for. What started out as a spellbinding miracle of biblical proportions has now turned into a manhunt for murder. Jack Waters, the town reporter, suspects him of foul play. Some say the stranger is a gift from God, while others believe he is the devil himself. Once Jack's only daughter is diagnosed with a terminal illness, he is confronted with a major decision. Does he sit back and watch his own flesh and blood waste away, or does he schedule an appointment with Gud. With authorities hot on Gud's trail, Jack soon becomes a new suspect in the case. Just how far is he willing to go to save his daughter's life? Jack finds the quest for writing the news-breaking story makes him the headliner. This book also introduces the first glimpse into the world of The Protector's, a real life religious society established for spreading and protecting the Word of God at any cost.
