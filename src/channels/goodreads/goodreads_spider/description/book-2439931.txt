2439931:::::Sniper One: The Blistering True Story Of A British Battle Group Under Siege:::::Iraq, 2004. Sgt. Dan Mills and the rest of the 1st Battalion, The Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment, were supposed to be winning hearts and minds. They were soon fighting for their lives... Within hours of the battalion's arrival in Iraq, a grenade bounced off one of their Land Rovers, rolled underneath, and detonated. The ambush marked the beginning of a full-scale firefight during which Mills killed a man with a round that removed his assailant's head. The mission had already gone from bad to worse. Throat-burning winds, blast bombs, and militias armed with AKs, RPGs, and a limitless supply of mortar rounds were the icing on the cake for Mills and his men. For the next six months--isolated, besieged, and under constant fire--their battalion refused to give an inch. This is the""breathtaking true chronicle of their endurance, camaraderie, dark humor, and courage in the face of relentless, lethal assault.
