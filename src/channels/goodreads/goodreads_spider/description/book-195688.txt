195688:::::Life Sucks:::::Life sucks for Dave Marshall. The girl he s in love with doesn t know he exists, he hates his job, and ever since his boss turned him into a vampire, he can t go out in daylight without starting to charbroil. Undead life in its uncoolest incarnation yet is on display in this cinematic, supernatural drama told with gallons of humor and hemoglobin. In striking, colorful, B-movie style artwork and light-hearted, intelligent writing by Jessica Abel, Gabe Soria, and Warren Pleece, Dave Marshall s story comes alive in a vampiric kind of way.
