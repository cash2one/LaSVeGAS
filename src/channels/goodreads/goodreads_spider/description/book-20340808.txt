The One transcendent God manifests in and through everything. We can adore God as Devi, Allah, Buddha, Jesus, Sai Baba, Great Spirit. God's presence can be sensed in nature as a flower, a scintillating sunset or the vast, breathless, star studded expanse of space. When we gaze into the soft, innocent eyes of an infant, God is there. And in the warm, beckoning eyes of our sweetheart, God is actively present. In God, the Great Effulgence and Purest Love we move, breathe and have our being. Sonya Ki has eloquently expressed her love for the many forms of God through her ecstatic poetry. These poems are woven in rich, meaningful beauty and language designed to inspire the reader and elevate his/her consciousness above the ordinary into a realm of love, hope and spiritual insight. As you meditate on the uplifting words in this book, allow yourself to experience a pure connection to Divine Love, which is the source of all inspiration.
