18661755:::::The Revelation:::::It's been three years since I have turned, and I am not sure who I am anymore. I don't even know if I want to be what I have become. Is love enough to keep me alive inside even if I am dead? How can I find peace within myself when everything around me screams war and death? How will things end when one man holds my eternal love and another wants me dead? There is no end as far as I can see. It s just the beginning because I can feel the darkness approaching. It wants me. It calls for me by name. I will keep on fighting until it arrives. The problem is, if I don t learn to shut off my emotions I may just become my own worst enemy. Is it all too much, or not enough? These are the things a vampire queen, new mother and woman fighting with her past human morals must ask herself. I have one more important question to answer that could change everything. IS THIS REALLY WHAT I WANT? The red jeweled necklace the coven called The Eye of the Queen sat right at my cleavage. I ran one finger over my pale skin and red lips as I looked at my reflection in the mirror. Queen was my title, but I knew different. I was just a beautiful killer.
