26810441:::::Beaten:::::My name is Lo Knight. I am possibly the worst person in the world. All I wanted was for them to disappear. I killed my parents. Heath Mavrick has a claim on me that can t be touched. He is a free soul, a wild card, but he was the tiny spark that caught my whole world on fire and brought it all crumbling down into a pile of ashes. I cut him from my life, and, in turn I lost the love I loved the most. Change is hard, especially if it s being forced. So when life gives you a second chance, you take it. You make it right. You play it safe. You don t fall for a dangerous street racer. I was warned. Never date the bad-boy, tattooed, asshole, and Talon is all three. The names Talon Baylor. I m great-looking, hot-blooded, and worshipped. I don t ask. I just take. I love competition and I never lose. Me? I m numero uno Okay, okay, I know what you re thinking. I m a bossy dominant prick. There, you happy? I said it. There s a new blonde in town that I ve made a promise to stay away from, but I can t. When she turned me down, she made this a challenge, and if I wasn t interested before I certainly am now. She can resist all she wants, but in the end, I always get my little trophy.
