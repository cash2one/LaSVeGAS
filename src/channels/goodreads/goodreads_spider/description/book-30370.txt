30370:::::Texas! Sage:::::"He was everything she despised in a man. So why couldn't she stay out of his arms?" This had to be the worst night of Sage Tyler's life. First her fianc jilts her. Then she has to fly home with Harlan Boyd, the arrogant, drop-dead gorgeous stranger who overheard every word of that humiliating episode--and enjoyed it! All Sage wants is for this sexy, no-account drifter to keep his distance--and keep her broken engagement a secret. But Harlan Boyd has desires of his own... She was the most beautiful, exciting, unpredictable woman Harlan had ever met, and he could barely keep his hands off of her. Yet he tried to stay away, tried to remember that Sage Tyler needed a man who'd convince her of her own worth, not a man who'd be moving on. Then Sage's family business, the Tyler Drilling Company, came under the threat of ruin, and Sage and Harlan suddenly found themselves fighting side by side to save it... in quarters too close to keep passion at bay. Can spoiled, headstrong Sage find love with a man who seems so easy to get and so hard to keep?
