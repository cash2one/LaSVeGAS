As one of the internet s most prestigious video bloggers, West talks about high school relationships under the name Sam Green. As far as he knows, no one from school, not even his best friend, Cat, has seen his videos. But the highlight of the whole thing is Harper Knight, who comments every day at exactly 2:02 in the afternoon. He doesn t know anything about her aside from the occasional deep philosophical messaging on why pizza tastes so delicious, but as stupid as it sounds, he might be falling for her. So when they finally agree to meet in real life, West s hope for romance seems more and more in reach. But that all changes as soon as he arrives at their meeting spot and sees Cat walking toward him, wearing the same I &lt;3 Sam Green T-shirt Harper promised she'd have on. To his alarm, West realizes he is falling in love with the best friend who has always been a sister to him.
