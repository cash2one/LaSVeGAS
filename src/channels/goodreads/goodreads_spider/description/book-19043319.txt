19043319:::::Peacocks Among the Tamarind Trees:::::Very complex and intricately woven, Peacocks among the Tamarind Trees is a gripping account of love, loss, forgiveness and rediscovery. An emotional roller-coster, the story unfolds across some of the most amazing settings on earth. The characters reveal themselves alternately through their strengths and vulnerabilities. Much deeper than a simple love story, Merlaine Hemstraat's novel is a psychological exploration of the strange corners inside the human mind. - KIERAN A. REVELL
