7230431:::::Lean on Me:::::"From beginning to end a sinfully delicious story of one woman's struggle to trust who she is inside and accept herself as well as the love of the man that she loves with all her heart." ~ Book Junkie Andrea wants to submit, but not to just any so-called Dom. He has to be tougher than the slum-bred bullies she grew up with. She d given up finding a true Dom when her friend finagles her a place as a trainee in an exclusive BDSM club with the powerful Shadowlands Masters. Andrea s thrilled and terrified. Forced to accept an unknown submissive into his carefully run trainee program, Master Cullen is furious. Not only is the young woman new to BDSM, but she s unsuited to her role--armoured in leather like a Domme, she s more liable to punch a Dom than kneel. He decides to push her right back out the door. But as he ruthlessly intimidates her, punishes her, then cuddles her, his glimpses of the woman inside the emotional armour intrigue him and her utter surrender captures his heart. Although Master Cullen is famous for his unfettered lifestyle, Andrea believes he might be interested in her, until she discovers he s not just a bartender--he s a cop. Maybe he d overlook her past brush with the law, but when another trainee accuses her of stealing money, Andrea knows she s lost the Master she wanted with all her heart.
