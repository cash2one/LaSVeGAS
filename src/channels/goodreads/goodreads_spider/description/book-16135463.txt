16135463:::::Eleven Sundays:::::Beautifully written [ ] A richly descriptive tale of grief and gratitude. Kirkus Reviews In a Northern California seaside town, two women without families, who have both suffered deep loss, forge an unlikely bond and become forever connected. Annie, a Pop-Tart- and espresso-fueled twentysomething thinks she s grown up but is still reaching for shiny gold stars. She establishes a comfortable home with her boyfriend and is on the rise as a user-interface developer with an established San Francisco tech firm. In Drake s Valley not far from the city, a mysterious souplady runs a one-room B&amp;B in a little town sheltered from time s advances. Tragedies shaped her solitary life and made her the target for gossip. Neighborhood kids call her "the bone lady." Despite being labeled the town eccentric, when someone is ill, she has what they need; a medicinal broth that takes on an almost magical quality. Annie is so focused on getting a promotion and the office s tedious work-a-day routine, pieces of her life fall away one at a time. Losing her boyfriend pales in comparison to missing the last moment ever to speak with her mother. She spirals into a dark place wanting everything normal again. The Golden Gate Bridge becomes her yellow brick road of escape to a mystical fog-capped valley along the seashore. Hope of resurrecting her life comes when Annie crosses paths with the enigmatic souplady who ladles out her special brew and intuitive views.
