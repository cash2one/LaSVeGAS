23002653:::::Before I Break:::::Out of the past six years of my life, I only remember about half of it. After a dozen doctors and thousands in medical bills, I was diagnosed with a rare neurological disorder--one that causes me to lose track of time. Sometimes it s hours, days or even weeks with no recollection of anything. The good thing is it's been almost two years since I had my last black out . It sounds much better than what the doctors refer to them as, 'episodes', like my life is a freakin' comedy. During those two years of normal, I finally managed to get my Bachelor s degree, a job I love, and I ve just proposed to a woman who has been there for me through it all. For the first time in a long time everything is on track. Until a strange woman shows up at my door she says I'm her husband and I think she s crazy. Until, I get a voice mail on my phone. It s from a guy name Cal. The weird part is, it s the same name the strange woman called me. What terrifies me, is this guy Cal his voice sounds just like mine.
