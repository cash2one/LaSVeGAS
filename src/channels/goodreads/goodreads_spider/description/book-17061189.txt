17061189:::::Aurora Sky:::::Kill first vampire. Check. Get drunk. Check Kiss a boy. Check. Lose virginity . . . After the accident, my world turned up-side-down. I wanted to attend college on the East Coast, but now I m stuck hunting vampires in Alaska all because the agency saved my life. Agent Melcher says my rare blood type makes me special. It s toxic to vampires. He says I can help save mankind. But let s be real. Basically, I m a glorified chew toy. My BF s avoiding me like the plague. My new friends are misfit suck junkies. My hunting partner is an overzealous action junkie with a killer smile. Then there s Fane Donado. Crude, delinquent, Mr. Joe Cool with the Cheshire grin, horrible dyed hair, and mismatched lips. As if life weren t cruel enough, I can t stop staring at his mouth or daydreaming about doing wicked things with him. Clearly the old Aurora is gone forever. Destroyed in the wreckage. I don t know who I am anymore, only that I suddenly have intense cravings and a V.I.P. pass into Alaska s underworld. If vampires found out who I worked for it would be lights out forever. In the meantime, I have some undead ass to kick.
