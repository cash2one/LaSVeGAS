17317164:::::A Basic Renovation:::::When it comes down to it, rats in the oven trumps Lesley s desire to never set eyes on another Brennan family member. So Lesley, a pro at property redevelopment, scrambles to Dominic Brennan s hardware store for supplies. Dominic knows poison rat and otherwise and he sees it in Lesley. The woman ruined his brother s life. Now that she s back in town, Dominic s afraid she ll drag up the past, the secrets, and the pain. They clash immediately, but mix in a teenage boy, a puppy, some white paint, and some loud music, and what starts as cold fury transforms into a nuclear attraction. This basic renovation becomes a major life refurbishment for them both.
