20580333:::::Intensity Laid Bare:::::Zelda MacKenzie is a flame-haired Scottish beauty with a bad reputation. The villagers suspect she may be a witch, a rumour encouraged by her paralysing effect on the local menfolk. But Alec Munro, Earl of Dalgliesh , isn't frightened by the gossip. If anything, he's spurned on by it, and the fact that Zelda shows not an ounce of physical interest in him maddens him even more. Zelda could be Alec's greatest conquest yet, if only he could make her stay with him. Will the Earl succeed in tempting the beautiful witch girl into his bed or is Zelda simply too wild to tame?
