18482611:::::Deathwatch:::::As the only person who can identify the most notorious hit man in the country, Kat Bridges is running for her life. Murphy Dolan is in the Army Reserves, returning from his 2nd tour of duty, only to find a stranger hiding in his house. She's scared spitless. He's completely burned-out on violence. Neither of them has any trust left to give. If the best of the FBI couldn't protect her from the country s most notorious assassin, does a burned-out small town cop have a prayer?
