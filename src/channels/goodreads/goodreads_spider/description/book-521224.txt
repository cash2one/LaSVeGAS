521224:::::Lay Her Among the Lilies:::::It was odd that a healthy young heiress like Janet Crosby should die of heart failure. Odder still that on the day she died she sent a note and $500 to Vic Malloy, private investigator, asking him to trace the person who was blackmailing her sister. Intrigued by the note, Malloy tried to see Maureen Crosby but only got as far as her nurse - a curvaceous blonde with an engaging bedside manner. Next he tried to see Janet's personal maid, but found that somebody else had reached her first and made sure she wouldn't talk to anyone - ever again... Unless he dropped the case Malloy knew he would almost certainly become the killer's next victim ; but when the blonde nurse disappeared and a hired gunman tried to shoot him, it seemed he didn't have any choice left...
