Brett presents Mutti's War, a historical novel based on the true events in the life of a German mother forced to smuggle her three small boys out of East Prussia when the Russians surrounded it in 1944. Her transformation from a privileged German wife and mother who unquestioningly trusted her husband to make all decisions for the family to a courageous survivor risking all in a trek across war-torn Europe to keep herself and her children alive and find her missing husband is told with fluid dialogue and heart-rending detail. A vivid, unforgettable story of courage and determination.
