128616:::::The Complete Uncollected Stories:::::A new "bootleg book", containing all 22 missing stories in one perfect-bound volume. The book is blue, with a paper ring around the cover. It has the title stamped on the title page and attributes itself to "Train Bridge Recluse" as a publisher. Supposedly, 1000 copies were made. This book contains twenty short stories and two novellas that have never before been collected or published outside of their original magazine appearences due to the wishes of the author who has declined to publish any of his work since 1965. Stories collected here for the first time include two 30,000 word novellas (The Inverted Forest &amp; Hapworth 16, 1924), two stories featuring Holden Caulfield in expanded scenes from The Catcher in the Rye (I'm Crazy &amp; Slight Rebellion Off Madison), and the Babe Gladwaller and Vincent Caulfield series (Last Day of the Last Furlough, This Sandwich Has No Mayonnaise &amp; The Stranger). This collection includes all known works by Salinger not already widely available.
