Part of the Imponderables series -- the unchallenged source of answers to civilization's most perplexing conundrums -- and charmingly illustrated by Kassie Schwan, this book provides you with knowledge about everyday life that encyclopedias, dictionaries, and almanacs just don't have. And think about it, where else are you going to find out why glue doesn't get stuck in the bottle?
