22881797:::::Play of Light:::::I lived in paradise, and I loved Spencer Pierce. At fourteen, my life was perfect. The beach was my playground, and the boy who stole my heart lived just around the corner. But perfect never lasts. In one horrifying moment, I lost it all. My family was destroyed, and the boy I believed in turned his back on me. Paradise became a nightmare. That was five years ago. Everything changed when we moved from our home by the sea. I ve changed, and I don t like who I ve become. I miss the smiling, carefree beach girl who disappeared that terrible night. I want to find her again. I want to face the people we ran from so long ago. Most of all, I have to face Spencer. So I can prove that when he broke my heart, he didn t break me. But when I see him again, Spencer Pierce is no longer the boy from my memories. He s now a man who could devastate me if I let him. He watches me when he thinks I m not looking. There s regret written on his face when he s near. Each time I see him, my heart aches for what might have been, and I think his does too. How can I convince myself I m over him when I suspect he never got over me?
