6324298:::::In Case It Comes Up In Conversation Almost Everything Everyone Should Be At Least Vaguely Familiar With:::::In this book you can learn a modest amount of information pertaining to many topics or you can learn nothing in particular, your choice. It contains fundamental details of various topics that everyone should be at least vaguely familiar with and does it with wit and sarcasm. All this comes indexed for the anal retentive. Categories include entertainment, culture, history, technology, and potpourri, each with its own subcategories. Each category is followed by a quiz to assess your retention. Also included is a final test and certificate of completion. (This certificate can be proudly displayed on your fridge next to your child's drawing of an antler bearing purple cat.) This book is for entertainment purposes only, based upon my definition of the word 'entertainment'. www.incaseitcomesup.com
