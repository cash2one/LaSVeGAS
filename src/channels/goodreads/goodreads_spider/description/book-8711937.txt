8711937:::::The Cobra:::::The cocaine industry is worth billions of dollars a year to the drug cartels who spread their evil seed across Western society. Its usage causes incalculable misery, poverty and death. Slowly, gradually, inexorably it is spreading... One man, Paul Devereaux, intellectual, dedicated, utterly ruthless and ex-CIA special ops, is given what seems like an impossible task: stop the drug barons, whatever it costs. At his disposal, anything he wants - men, resources, money. He must assemble a team equal to the lawless men who control this deadly trade. And he must not cease until he has completed his mission. Up to now the drug trade have been accustomed to the forces of global law and order attempting to prevent them plying their business. And up to now those forces have played by the rules. But that is about to change. The rules no longer apply - and a dirty war is about to get a whole lot dirtier... From jungle airstrips in Brazil to the mangrove swamps of Guinea-Bissau, from the barrios of Bogota to the boardrooms of Washington, The Cobra peels back the terrifying reality of the global cocaine business as it's never been seen before. It is an extraordinarily breathtaking and contemporary thriller which demonstrates the master storyteller, Frederick Forsyth, at the very top of his game.
