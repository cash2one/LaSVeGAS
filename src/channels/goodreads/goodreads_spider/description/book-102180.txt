102180:::::Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad:::::Created in 1951 to ensure the future of an embattled Israel, the Mossad has been responsible for the most audacious and thrilling feats of espionage, counterterrorism, and assassination ever ventured. Gordon Thomas's 1999 publication of Gideon's Spies , resulting from closed-door interviews with Mossad agents, informants, and spymasters as well as from classified documents and top-secret sources, revealed previously untold truths about the Israeli intelligence agency. And now, in this edition, Thomas updates his classic text and shows the Mossad as it truly is: brilliant, ruthless, and flawed, but ultimately awesome. Three all-new chapters cover topics including: - How the Mossad planned to assassinate Saddam Hussein - Saddam's food-testing ritual, and the surprising "source" within his government - China's U.S.-based front-companies, and its relationship with bin Laden - Mossad's untold role in the events before and after 9/11 - Mossad and revelations about Princess Diana's death - The disappearance of the millions transferred from the Vatican Bank to the Polish Solidarity movement - How extremists recruit suicide bombers, including women - Mossad's untold role in the Iraq war and the hunts for Saddam and bin Laden - Saddam's plans for trial
