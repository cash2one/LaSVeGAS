1275466:::::The Cattle:::::Shortly after implementation of the Real ID Act of 2005, the United States National Identification System is created and an intense period of information gathering is begun. Detailed personal data about all U.S. residents is stored in a registered, highly secured database controlled by an enigmatic government agency. The governmental grip tightens with new laws requiring standardized state documents that comply with federal guidelines. And this is only the beginning. Following exhaustive and flawless testing of the fledgling National Identification System, the government forces the issue of microprocessor implants for verification purposes. Every person in the United States of America will be implanted with a Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) microchip to authenticate identity and store personal information. Yet, one question remains unanswered: Is identity verification the only reason for signifying everyone with the Mark of the Beast? The evening before the National Identification System officially becomes a reality, during the last control tests of the system, something goes wrong: Someone accidentally discovers the real purpose of the implants. A secret agenda, hidden behind the ""identity verification"" cover, is exposed.
