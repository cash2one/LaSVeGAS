7990228:::::Sacred Freedom: Western Liberalist Ideologies in the Light of Islam:::::Sacred Freedom contains a concise and frank examination of the legitimacy of atheism, humanism, pluralism, democracy, and secularism as guiding ideologies for humankind. Discussing the consequences of a pluralistic worldview, Sacred Freedom questions whether the West has examined the realities of democracy before endeavoring to spread it by force around the world. Are ideologies derived from Western historical experiences universally applicable? Has the West arrived at a balanced understanding of personal freedom? These are only some of the important questions raised in this unique book.
