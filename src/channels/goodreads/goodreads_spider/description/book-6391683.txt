6391683:::::Skin Game:::::A beautiful fugitive wanted dead or alive. Kyra is a con woman and a particular kind of thief. She steals with a touch, but she only takes one thing: her target s strongest skill. Which means she can be a fighter, an athlete, a musician, an artist anything she wants for a limited time. Heartbroken, she turns her gift toward avenging her father s murder; with deadly patience, Kyra works her way into casino owner Gerard Serrano s inner circle. After pulling off the ultimate con, she flees with his money and his pride. A hit man who never misses the mark. Reyes has nothing but his work. Pity for Kyra, he s the best and mercy never sways him once he takes a job. He s been hired to find out where Kyra hid the cash and bring her back to face Serrano s justice. Dead will do, if he can t locate the loot. He s never failed to complete a contract, but Kyra tempts him with her fierce heat and her outlaw heart. So Reyes has a hell of a choice: forsake his word or kill the woman he might love.
