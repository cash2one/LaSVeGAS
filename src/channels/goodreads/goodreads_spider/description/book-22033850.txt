22033850:::::Dirty Little Misery:::::Lust can be downright lethal. Thanks to her freakish, satyr-like power, Jessica Moore was denied her dream to join the Gryphons, the magical law-enforcement officers protecting humanity from the pred races. But after the Gryphons tried to arrest her for murders she didn t commit, Jess is no longer interested. Too bad they are. Now that they know what she can do, they want Jess on their side. If she doesn t agree to help them solve a new case, they ll charge her with every magical crime she s ever committed. Nine people are dead. The cause? Exhaustion. The activity? Never-ending sex. Someone sold them tainted F, an illegal aphrodisiac made by satyrs. No surprise, Jess s satyr allies aren t pleased with her investigation. Worse, it strains her tenuous relationship with Lucen, the one satyr she counts as a friend. As Jess delves into the shady satyr business world, she unravels a scheme more sinister than dirty drugs and her relationship with Lucen unravels right along with it. Only the truth will save their friendship. But not before it turns Jess into an ambitious killer s next target. Warning: Contains blackmail, betrayal, and sex that s literally to die for. Plus plenty of bad stiff jokes to go with it. Remember, just say no to magical drugs.
