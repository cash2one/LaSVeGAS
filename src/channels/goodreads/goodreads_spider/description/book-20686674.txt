20686674:::::An Imperfect Circle:::::"What do you do when the boy who rescues the last remnants of your soul rejects what s left straight afterwards? You move on. That s what you do. I m not the sort of girl who sits on the sofa with a bucket of ice cream mourning over anything. Especially not over a boy." Sixteen year old Ellie Belrose has spent the last five years rebuilding her life after something she'd rather forget. She's finally getting somewhere but, when a figure from her past makes an unwanted reappearance in her life, she's forced to confront her demons. Karl Carter is fascinated by Ellie the moment he sees her but he doesn't realise she's Elise. His Elise. He never forgot her and still isn't willing to - despite her insistence. The two of them are stubborn, angry at the world, and sparks fly when they come together. Can they help each other move on from the past or will they drag each other back there?
