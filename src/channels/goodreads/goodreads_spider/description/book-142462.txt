142462:::::Flashman and the Redskins:::::Celebrated Victorian bounder, cad, and lecher, Sir Harry Flashman, V.C., returns to play his (reluctant) part in the Battle of Little Bighorn in the seventh volume of the critically acclaimed Flashman Papers . What was Harry Flashman doing on the slopes of Little Bighorn, caught between the gallant remnant of Custer's 7th Cavalry and the attack of Sitting Bull's braves?

The West as it really was: terrifying!
