177413:::::Waiting for It:::::Love that lasts forever is the kind worth waiting for. Taylor Moore is an artist. With the bold colors of her palette, she gives life to her passionate memories of Jake Farrell. It's been ten long years since the dark-haired, green-eyed football player left town. In that decade, Taylor has been married to and divorced from the bitter man who always stood between them. After all this time, she still aches with hunger for that ruggedly beautiful boy from her past, unable to love another. But when Jake suddenly comes home, all grown up and claiming to have returned for her, Taylor's not buying it. She's more than ready to trust the gorgeous man with her body, allowing his dominant sexuality full control; she just refuses to trust him with her heart. But Jake's been waiting a lifetime for this woman, and he's not about to accept half-measures. He wants her full surrender, and Taylor must finally find the courage to stop waiting for it and start living for love.
