1089501:::::Power In The Blood:::::From the author of the bestselling Western classic Heart of the Country comes a haunting, beautiful tale of kinship, of lives entwined and wrenched apart, fortunes made and lost, and the unpredictability of fate--set in the savage old West. Not long after the Civil War, two brothers and their sister head west to find a new beginning. Years later, after a long separation, they are reunited at last during a train robbery.
