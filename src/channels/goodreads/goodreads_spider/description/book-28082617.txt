28082617:::::Hooked:::::Millie Diamond is your typical high school senior. She has great parents, a younger brother, and two best friends who round out her better than average life. Her future is planned out, thanks to her police officer father, who strictly enforces the rules with a firm, but loving hand. Millie is a kind-hearted soul and proper daughter who respects her dad's authority...until she meets a mysterious new student who stirs emotions in her she's never felt before. A drug deal gone bad in South Boston, leaves Cash Davis' mother no choice but to move him to Tennessee. His life hasn't been easy, but Cash is tough, and plans on making his future better than his past. Those plans include keeping his head down and finishing high school... but nothing ever comes easy for Cash. His connection with Millie surprises him, and as hard as he tries, he can't stay away from her. Millie's dad arresting him before their first date is definitely not ideal for Cash, and it causes friction between Millie and her parents. Can Millie convince her parents that Cash is the guy for her? Will she still want to after secrets from his past are revealed?
