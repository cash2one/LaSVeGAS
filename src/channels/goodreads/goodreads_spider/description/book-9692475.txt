9692475:::::Anomaly:::::Relapse can be addicting J doesn't need rehab. He's well clean of the hard stuff, the soft stuff, and the things in between that helped him bury all the doubts that plague him. That was before the tormented drug addict from next door threatens to set J on a renewed path of self-destruction. It was before his friend Molly runs afoul of the law, and it's before J suffers a beating that brings him ultimately face-to-face with the woman who can help him see the light in the darkness. A dark and gritty literary tale for those who enjoy their contemporary new adult fiction brooding. Anomaly is set amidst the drama of small town Canada where the seamy world of substance abuse and sexuality is a surprising backdrop for self discovery and a person who is finally coming of age. When you barely understand yourself, relapse becomes more than just a fight for sobriety.
