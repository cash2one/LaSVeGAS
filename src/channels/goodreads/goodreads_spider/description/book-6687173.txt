6687173:::::Deliver Us from Evil:::::A beautiful yet tough woman working in a beautiful yet tough setting, Brannon Callahan is a search and rescue helicopter pilot for the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. Strong faith and a decorated history of service have kept her one step ahead of on-the-job dangers, but there s no precedent for what s about to happen. After a blizzard takes down a small plane carrying U.S. Marshal Roark Holland (already haunted by a recent tragedy), Brannon must save him in more ways than one and safeguard the donor heart he s transporting to a government witness on the edge of death. Otherwise the largest child trafficking ring in history with shocking links from Thailand to Tennessee will slip further away into darkness along the Appalachian Trail. * Award of Merit winner, Holt Medallion Contest, Virginia Romance Writer's Association
