30513683:::::The Gold:::::Ten-year-old Amanda is constantly teased and tormented in school. Her home life is less than satisfactory where her widower father, who is often away on business trips, leaves her in the care of her indifferent teenaged sister. Worse, not a day goes by when Amanda doesn't miss her mom. TO escape reality, Amanda creates fantasy stories, but when she discovers a talking golden pebble, her imagined world turns into a new-fangled reality. "The story is magical and at the same time realistic, and young readers will be able to connect well with the character of Amanda, her loss,pain, and disappointment. The book not only handles the topic of bullying, but also gives hope to all those youngsters experiencing loneliness and hurt." - Reader's Favorite
