13566655:::::The Sacred Canopy: Elements of a Sociological Theory of Religion:::::Influential scholar Peter L. Berger explores the sociological underpinnings of religion and the rise of a modern secular society Acclaimed scholar and sociologist Peter L. Berger carefully lays out an understanding of religion as a historical, societal mechanism in this classic work of social theory. Berger examines the roots of religious belief and its gradual dissolution in modern times, applying a general theoretical perspective to specific examples from religions throughout the ages. Building upon the author s previous work, The Social Construction of Reality , with Thomas Luckmann, this book makes Berger s case that human societies build a sacred canopy to protect, stabilize, and give meaning to their worldview.
