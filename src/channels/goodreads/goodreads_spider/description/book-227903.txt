227903:::::Jinx On The Divide:::::Felix is back at school, but things aren't back to normal! Rhino, the class bully, snatches the mysterious Brandee lamp he had kept from his last adventure in BACK TO THE DIVIDE, and next thing you know, a djinn has taken Rhino hostage and is demanding that Felix return him home to the mystical, back-to-front world. But no sooner is the djinn's wish granted than Rhino escapes into the villanous protection of Skullcap, new chief nasty of the Japegrins. It's up to Felix and Bettony to once again use their wits to save both worlds from the ultimate explosive threat of mixed-up science and magic.
