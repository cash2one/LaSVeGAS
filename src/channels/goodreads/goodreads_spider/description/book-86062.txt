86062:::::The Naked Civil Servant:::::A comical and poignant memoir of a gay man living life as he pleased in the 1930s In 1931, gay liberation was not a movement it was simply unthinkable. But in that year, Quentin Crisp made the courageous decision to "come out" as a homosexual. This exhibitionist with the henna-dyed hair was harassed, ridiculed and beaten. Nevertheless, he claimed his right to be himself whatever the consequences. The Naked Civil Servant is both a comic masterpiece and a unique testament to the resilience of the human spirit.
