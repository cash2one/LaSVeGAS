6395277:::::Mothering Your Nursing Toddler:::::How long are you going to nurse your baby? Six months? Eight months? A year? What if you celebrate your baby's first birthday and your little one is still nursing, with no sign of letting up any time soon? Many a modern mother has felt as though she has embarked on uncharted waters as she continues to breastfeed a child into toddlerhood. The child's need to nurse is clear- but mother has lots of questions. In this revised edition of Mothering Your Nursing Toddler author Norma Jane Bumgarner puts the experience of nursing an older baby or child in perspective, within the context of the entire mother-child relationship. She cites biological, cultural, and historical evidence in support of extended breastfeeding and shares stories gleaned from thousands of families in which nursing and natural weaning have been the norm. With warm insight into the needs of both mothers and children, this book covers what parents need to know about nursing toddlers.
