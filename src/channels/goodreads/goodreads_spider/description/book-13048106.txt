13048106:::::Self-Knowledge for Spiritual Awakening:::::Self-knowledge is the starting point of all true change in the individual and the world. The darkness of the subconscious and the ego can be uncovered to reveal the light of consciousness - the eternal spiritual part of us which contains all love, peace, inner faculties, and happiness, and which can be permanently awakened and increased. In Self-Knowledge for Spiritual Awakening by Belsebuub, discover the timeless and universal form of transcendental psychology found at the root of the world's great spiritual teachings and put it into practice immediately with key spiritual exercises such as awareness, self-observation, analysis of an ego, mantras, dream recall, and meditation. In over twenty-two chapters, Belsebuub outlines the multi-dimensional structure of the psyche beyond what modern science has been able to understand, and provides a hands-on guide to using eternal sacred practices to break free of depression, addiction, anger, fear, etc. and discover one's true self and purpose. The book is based on the hugely popular Searching Within online course by Belsebuub taken by tens of thousands of people worldwide. Everyone has the ability to change far more radically than is usually assumed. Just because the information on how to do this is currently obscure or difficult to find in society doesn't mean that it cannot be done and that a huge and radical transformation cannot be achieved. What is needed are the correct techniques to use; if they are applied properly, you will be astonished at what you can do ~ Belsebuub
