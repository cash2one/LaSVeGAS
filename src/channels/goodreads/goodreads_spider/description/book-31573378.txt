When novelist Melanie Vander faces a looming deadline, she decides it s time for an escape to an inspiring, novel-worthy locale. She s not running away. Really. She just needs time to focus. But as she disappears into her writing, she encounters a man whose tenderness leaves her reeling. Engaging and wise, psychologist Elliot Hammond tempts Melanie to question everything, including her marriage. But that s ridiculous. Dr. Hammond isn t even real. Melanie s husband, Craig, has his own problems, including a recession that s threatening his business. Waning finances, a looming home foreclosure, and a wife who s checked out emotionally, has Craig feeling as though he s carrying his burdens alone. When his client, the beautiful and single Serena Buchanan, offers him a solution to his financial woes, he s tempted by more than her offer of a business solution. At a crossroads, Melanie and Craig seem headed in opposite directions. As Melanie runs away from her problems by escaping into her own fictional world, Craig dives into his struggles, seeking God for strength and healing for his marriage. Ultimately, Melanie must choose whether she ll check out completely, or allow her characters to lead her home.
