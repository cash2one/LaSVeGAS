129273:::::In My Father's House:::::The Shiloh Legacy series covers the lives of four young soldiers and their families through these great events: the end of World War I in France, the return of the soldiers to America, the Roaring Twenties, the stock-market crash, the resulting Great Depression, and the rebuilding of lives that must follow. Yet with all the racial, social, and cultural intolerance that marked the day seemingly immovable mountains in the lives of these characters God works through the tragedy, the laughter, the pain, the joy, the dramatic, and the ordinary to create a yearning in their hearts for a faith that moves mountains.
