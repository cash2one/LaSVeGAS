546296:::::Dynamics of Character: Self-regulation in Psychopathology:::::Dr. David Shapiro's first new book in ten years, Dynamics of Character deepens his now-classic studies of psychopathology with this conceptualization of a dynamics of the whole character--a self-regulatory system that encompasses personal attitudes, modes of activity, and relationship with the external world. Extending and magnifying Shapiro's original vision of psychopathology, Dynamics of Character is a resonantly reasoned response to the reduction of complex processes of mind to products of biological defect of psychological trauma.
