21362707:::::Whernside:::::The winter of 1947 is about to fall on the Yorkshire Dales. With it comes the gypsy, William Cooper a dark-haired and dark-eyed twenty-four-year-old, whose sculptured body shames Michelangelo s David. Although, best with horses, he is a Jack-of-all-trades and is seeking work. A chance meeting with the newlywed Henleys, results in his employment an encounter that will steer all their paths. From the moment William put on the Italian suit, it set the yearning. One day, he was going to have his own. And here, being part of the Whernside estate, he had a good shot at it. It was just a matter of focusing the master on his worth. Whernside moves through the years of 1947 to 1973. It tells of the lives, loves and losses of those connected to it four generations just over a quarter of a century taken from its 400 year history. A history steeped in tales.
