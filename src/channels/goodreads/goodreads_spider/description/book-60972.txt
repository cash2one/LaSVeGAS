60972:::::The Other Side of Darkness:::::Here for the first time is Derrick Jensen live, recorded at one of his many standing-room only performances. Speaking in almost improvisational style, Jensen explores the nature of injustice, of what civilizations do to the natural world, and how, in the face of the resulting horror that is one of the all too apparent consequences of grave injustice, civilized human beings create intricate systems of denial, silence, abnegation, deception and self-hatred to keep it at bay.
