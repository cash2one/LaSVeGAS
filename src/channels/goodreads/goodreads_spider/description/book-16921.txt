16921:::::The House That Jack Built:::::After Craig Bellman, a successful young New York lawyer, is horribly injured in a street mugging, he and his wife, Effie, retreat to the Hudson Valley to restore his health and save their relationship. When they discover a derelict old mansion, Valhalla, Craig becomes fascinated by it. He ignores Effie's misgivings and starts to make inquiries about buying it, undeterred by the expense and its history: it was built by legendary gambler and womanizer Jack Belias - and every owner since Belias has come to a tragic end. Even today, Valhalla echoes with its terrible past. Out of loyalty to her husband Effie tries to overcome her fears, but recruits a local spiritualist in an attempt to rid the house of its threatening vibrations. But death and destruction return to Valhalla, and Craig, obsessed by the house, becomes more of a stranger to Effie every day. It would appear that the spirit of Jack Belias is still with them...
