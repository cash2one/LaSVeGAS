10673335:::::Quantum Man: Richard Feynman's Life in Science:::::"A worthy addition to the Feynman shelf and a welcome follow-up to the standard-bearer, James Gleick's Genius ." Kirkus Reviews Perhaps the greatest physicist of the second half of the twentieth century, Richard Feynman changed the way we think about quantum mechanics, the most perplexing of all physical theories. Here Lawrence M. Krauss, himself a theoretical physicist and a best-selling author, offers a unique scientific biography: a rollicking narrative coupled with clear and novel expositions of science at the limits. From the death of Feynman s childhood sweetheart during the Manhattan Project to his reluctant rise as a scientific icon, we see Feynman s life through his science, providing a new understanding of the legacy of a man who has fascinated millions.
