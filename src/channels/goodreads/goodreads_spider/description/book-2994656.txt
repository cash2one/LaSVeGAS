2994656:::::Black Sheep:::::Stacy Calverleigh, having gambled away the family fortune, is in low water, his estates heavily mortgaged and his debts prodigious. He descends on the town on the look-out for a likely heiress, and quickly makes a conquest of Fanny Wendover, a dazzling, high-spirited orphan of seventeen. Fanny's aunt, Abigail, knowing Stacy's reputation, determines to put a stop to this affair, but the arrival on the scene of Stacy's uncle, Miles - the Black Sheep - does nothing to advance her plans. Black Sheep is one of Miss Heyer's lighter-hearted romances, with a charming heroine and a most intriguing hero - mysterious, good-humoured, cynical, outrageous and in the end irresistible.
