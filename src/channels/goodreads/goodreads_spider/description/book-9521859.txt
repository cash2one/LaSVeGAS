His loyalty and commitment are unwavering until he recruits Dax, a captivating and challenging Bronzeman who, despite his youth and inexperience, seduces Maen with his fierce hero worship. When they re captured by enemies of the City, Maen risks everything to save Dax: his position, his faith, and even his life.
