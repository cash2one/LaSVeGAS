7010624:::::Doubting Jesus' Resurrection: What Happened in the Black Box?:::::This highly endorsed book, written for believers, non-believers, and those who are not quite sure about Jesus' resurrection, offers a non-traditional explanation for the birth of Christianity and explains it with unusual clarity. The following excerpts are from nine endorsements on the back cover and inside title page (or just inside the title page in ebook formats): "Clearly written and well argued, Doubting Jesus' Resurrection lays out a plausible and intriguing case for a non-supernatural explanation of the New Testament resurrection accounts" (Robert J. Miller, Professor of Religious Studies, Juniata College). "Komarnitsky's answers are well-documented and carefully considered, and his central thesis is intriguing. Highly recommended" (Rev. Chuck Jones, Atlanta, Georgia). "Komarnitsky shows great acuity of judgment and clear-eyed perception of the issues. He does not claim to have proof of what happened at Christian origins, but he does present a powerfully plausible hypothesis for what might have happened" (Robert M. Price, Ph.D. Theology, Ph.D. New Testament). "Komarnitsky presents a surprisingly excellent demonstration of how belief in the resurrection of Jesus could plausibly have originated by natural means" (Richard Carrier, Ph.D. Ancient History).
