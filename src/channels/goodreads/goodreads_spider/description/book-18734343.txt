18734343:::::God Signs & Dad Stories:::::They are the stories of her father: stories of travel, of poverty and of faith in God through every season in life. In her first book, God Signs &amp; Dad Stories, Christian author Paula Pettis memorializes the memory of her late dad, Russell Pettis, through collected stories of his life. The first section of the book chronicles Russell's upbringing in Wisconsin during the Great Depression, when poverty was prevalent but family love abounding, as well as his time spent sailing in the Merchant Marines during World War II and later in other branches. Paula presents a touching tribute to her father in the second half of the book, recalling the months spent caring for her aging parent in hospital ICUs and through countless doctor visits. Yet through prayer, support from loved ones and unexplainable signs from God, she created treasured moments with her earthly father that celebrated her Heavenly Father.
