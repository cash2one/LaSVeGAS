594202:::::Wild Card Quilt: Taking a Chance on Home:::::Seventeen years after leaving home "for good," self-sufficient single mother Janisse Ray leaves her comfortable life in Montana to revisit her cracker origins. Craving a life built on "land, history, and blood," she moves into the family's rundown 1920s farmhouse in Baxley, Georgia. There she rediscovers the nearly lost pleasures of country life - a Thanksgiving syrup boil, alligator trapping, and neighbors - as well as family skirmishes. Wild Card Quilt is the story of her return and the adventures that follow as she ponders whether she will stay in Baxley "and die where seven generations of grandmothers had died" before her.
