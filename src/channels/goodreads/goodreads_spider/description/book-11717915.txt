11717915:::::We Need to Talk About Kevin:::::Now a major motion picture by Lynne Ramsay, starring Tilda Swinton and John C. Reilly,Lionel Shriver s resonant story of a mother s unsettling quest to understandher teenage son s deadly violence, her own ambivalence toward motherhood, andthe explosive link between them reverberates with the haunting power of highhopes shattered by dark realities. Like Shriver s charged and incisive laternovels, including So Much for That and The Post-Birthday World , We Need to Talk About Kevin isa piercing, unforgettable, and penetrating exploration of violence, familyties, and responsibility, a book that the Boston Globe describes as sometimes searing . . . [and] impossible to put down.
