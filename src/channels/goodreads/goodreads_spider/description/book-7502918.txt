7502918:::::Blanco Sol:::::King Sutherland is dead---at least that's what both friend and foe assume. The war ended almost a year ago, yet King was seriously wounded after the surrender, delaying his return home. Recently recovered, he is on his way back to Texas and the Blanco Sol ranch. Things have changed during his five-year absence. Outlaws stripped the homestead of its herd of Durango White horses and former flame Mercedes Alvaraz is married to Clint Sutherland, King's brother. Complicating an already strained union, Mercedes' father is ready to take over the ranch by force, insisting that he has a rightful claim to Blanco Sol, and Clint is accused of robbing stages and wagon trains and murdering the passengers, even women and little children. Sue Ellen, a proud rebel beauty, steals King's heart, but she hates him because he chose to fight for the Union. King is determined to not only win her affection, but clear his brother's name and collect a herd of wild Spanish cattle to drive north to the railhead in order to prevent the ranch from being stolen out from under him.
