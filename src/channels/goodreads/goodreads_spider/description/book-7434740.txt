He crossed paths with the very dangerous and deadly Russian assassin Ivan Morozov, who had been using the name Stan Emerson and was in Florida attempting to locate Steven's boss, Ernie Radix, who has stolen millions of dollars from the Russian government. Morozov was sent here to get it back, before Radix, who was awaiting trial, was sent to jail for the crimes that he had committed. After his near death encounter with the dangerous and deadly Russian assassin, Steven Heidelberg was in a fight for his life and his journey became an endless battle filled with pain and death.
