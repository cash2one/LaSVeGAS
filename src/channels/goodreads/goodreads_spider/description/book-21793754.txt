Not Intended for Readers Under the Age of 17**** The Rockers Babies After the nightmares of our childhoods my guys and I have finally found the happiness we deserve. Shane is getting married, Drake and Jesse are going to be fathers, and I m making my own career with Nik s encouragement. It s taken a lifetime, but finally we have moved on I should have known better than to think life was just going to be simple from here on out. I knew from firsthand experience that right when you get comfortable and content those bitches Fate throw a curve ball into the mix. I wasn t expecting the possible tragedy that we are faced with. I m the strong one, the one that has to help the rest of them through the tough times, but I don t know how strong I can be for them through this -Emmie
