Tyler Johnson, THE HOLLYWOOD GOSSIP This compelling and true life story screams of betrayal, deceit, and an unsolved mystery. It began when a budding young woman was lured into a cunning and deceptive scheme which eventually became her undoing. The tale may have gone unnoticed under normal circumstances. However, the plot thickened when a famous celebrity, Bill Cosby, was the target of a greedy rouse. The timing couldn t have been worse as it fell on the heels of his son's murder. Ennis Cosby had been shot and killed the day an alleged extortion letter was delivered to the comedian demanding millions in hush money. During one of the most infamous trials of 1997 Cosby would face his adversary Autumn Jackson, and rue the day that she was born. Jackson could do nothing more than look into her father's eyes and weep for all that had never been. At least she believed the entertainer to be her father. This complicated and twisted saga is fraught with criminal and passion driven psychology. Who were the guilty ones and who were the innocents? I m Autumn Jackson s aunt. I was called on to be her traveling companion, confidant, and unlikely bodyguard. When people asked me what happened, the answer was complicated. A book needed to be written. Jewel Star
