27153413:::::Rise:::::Victoria has learned one thing in her life, you have to do what you have to do - and you have to minimize its impact on those around you. She leaves her friends behind with just a simple letter and begins to walk down a very dark and dangerous path. Her parents are still dead, her brother is still missing, and she battles with opening herself up to the band of witches and stray vampire she now calls a friend. More secrets will come as some members of her inner circle reveal they aren't who everyone thinks they are. Will she be able to escape the shadow that is haunting her, forgive her friends before it's too late, or will those she cares about once again get caught in the crossfire?
