922119:::::Woman on the Run:::::What's a girl to do? Sophisticated urbanite Julia Devaux loves her life. What's not to love? A fabulous job in publishing, wonderful friends, gorgeous apartment, the company of her beautiful though temperamental Siamese cat, Federico Fellini--she's got it made. But then Julia has the bad luck to witness a Mob murder and her life goes straight down the toilet. Under the Witness Security program, Julia is relocated to the boondocks, a hundred miles from the nearest bookstore and Estee Lauder outlet, where the only fast food is deer and the only entertainment is sex with a laconic local rancher. Luckily, talking isn't what Sam Cooper does best... Former SEAL Sam Cooper can't believe his luck when mystery woman Sally Anderson hits town. Simpson, Idaho, can't even offer a decent cup of coffee let alone gorgeous new grade school teachers. The instant Cooper sees Sally, he stakes her out as his own. Granted, he's not much good at talking, but he does his best to keep her happy. When he discovers her life is in danger, he'll stop at nothing to keep her safe and with him. He's not alone. The whole town of Simpson wants to keep her. Publisher's Note: This is a rewritten and expanded version of a story previously published under the title PURSUED.
