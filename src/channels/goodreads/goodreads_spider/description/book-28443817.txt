28443817:::::Highly Illogical Behavior:::::Teen and adult fans of Matthew Quick, David Levithan, and Rainbow Rowell will adore this quirky story of coming-of-age, coming out, friendship, love...and agoraphobia. Sixteen-year-old Solomon is agoraphobic. He hasn t left the house in three years, which is fine by him. Ambitious Lisa desperately wants to get into the second-best psychology program for college (she s being realistic). But how can she prove she deserves a spot there? Solomon is the answer. Determined to fix Sol, Lisa thrusts herself into his life, introducing him to her charming boyfriend Clark and confiding her fears in him. Soon, all three teens are far closer than they thought they d be, and when their facades fall down, their friendships threaten to collapse, as well. A hilarious and heartwarming coming-of-age perfect for readers of Me and Earl and the Dying Girl and All The Bright Places , Highly Illogical Behavior showcases the different ways in which we hide ourselves from the world and the ways in which love, tragedy, and the need for connection may be the only things to bring us back into the light.
