2760362:::::Sin Remedio:::::"In a novel that mixes humor and tragedy with great dexterity, Caballero depicts some of Colombia's recent social and political upheavals with ferocious nihilism. The author, also known as a satirical cartoonist and a political columnist, suggests that his country's problems, like the antihero he has created, have no solution, that is, they are sin remedio"--Handbook of Latin American Studies, v. 58.
