17204850:::::Platinum:::::Althea Grant's Charleston gallery might be suffering from the bad economy, and her artistic aspirations have gone nowhere, but she's doing just fine, thank you. When bad-boy sculptor Steel rides up on his motorcycle looking to rent studio space, his infusion of cash is more than welcome. But his art is raw, visceral, sexual and completely inappropriate for her pastel world of watercolor landscapes. Steel, fascinated by Althea's rare albino coloring, sees in her the key to his next piece: a metal satyr designed for bondage games. Moving into her gallery basement is the first step; seducing the cool Southern belle into modeling for him is the second. As Steel peels away her careful manners and tasteful outfits, Althea begins to realize her life isn't just fine at all it's as pale and washed-out as the watercolor paintings she's failing to sell. Can she transform her life and accept her most secret desires?
