9761978:::::Scarred: A Memoir:::::In 1978, seven-year-old George Molho was kidnapped by his own father. For a year, he survived mental and physical abuse to the point of torture. He found it easier to get used tohell, instead of hoping that heaven was around the corner. George eventually escaped, but surviving the aftermath proved to be much more difficult.Past and present are skillfully woven together to connect the pieces of Molho's childhood and adult life that shaped the man he would become. The old adage 'love conquers all' is splayed open to reveal the inner workings thatwe all seek to understand. George was lucky to learn how to love from his family before his abduction, before his father's cruel version of love was inflicted upon his young body and psyche. Later in life, love compels him to reveal all that happened on the mountainside wherehe left his innocence as a boy. It's not about how hard we get hit; it's about how much we can take and keep moving forward. "Scarred" is a memoir written by a survivor, intended to empower and embolden all who have suffered, survived, and are ready to be set free. ""This will be known as the book that set the literary genre of memoir free." Scarred "reads like fiction while shattering the facade of make believe... Molho becomes the victor of his past and his triumph is contagious."" -Andrea Afra, "Free Press Houston"
