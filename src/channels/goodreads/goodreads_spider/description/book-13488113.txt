13488113:::::The Second Dragdani Prophecy:::::As the reality of the untimely death of King Jastark (John Stark) sinks in, it is up to the wizard and witch council s to fight back the dark Wizard-Elf, Ulicoth. At least until the dead king s son Drago (Peter Stark) can take the throne and fulfill The Second prophecy. Will the fact that Drago was trained as an ordinary wizard and raised in Earth (the Normal world of man) stand in the way of him being the king the second prophecy says he'll be? As the young king has just turned sixteen, his true powers have reached their peak. His luck goes from bad to worse as he has an unorthodox entrance into the mystical world of Dorminya, and Ulicoth will stop at nothing to track down and kill the boy king, and take over Dorminya forever.
