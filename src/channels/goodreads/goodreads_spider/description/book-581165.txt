581165:::::Seekers at the Wulfrock:::::THE DRAMATIC CONCLUSION TO THE MAGNIFICENT SAGA OF WOLVES FROM ONE OF THE WORLD'S FAVOURITE STORYTELLERS... 'The wolf's eyes transfixed me, commanded me to rise and leave now, commanded me to journey on, journey home where I began, to where you and I must go.' Under the austere yet inspiring leadership of Klimt, the Wolves of time have taken back the Heartland. They have defeated the treacherous Magyar wolves, successfully avoided confrontation with the Menne, and their first cubs have been raised, one of whom is the god Wulf, inmortal form. But now Klimt faces a new responsibility. as the loathsome Magyars regain their strength and the Mennen enter a phase of war and anarchy that threatens to engulf Europe, the Wolves must find a new spiritual direction and purpose. Both Wolves and Mennen must make their separate journeys to the Wulfrock, there to play out the dramatic events decreed by destiny, and bring the Dark Millenium to a triumphant close.
