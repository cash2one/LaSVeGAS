31373762:::::See Through Heart:::::Ainsley came into my life in a flurry of vibrant colors, lighting my world up when all seemed lost.

Until she dealt me the greatest blow. Now, abandonment, betrayal, and death darken every corner of my life. Anger and hurt burn bright where love and trust once lived. But, now, she s back. Sure, she s changed, but I see through it straight to her heart.
