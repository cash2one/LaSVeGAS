710603:::::Holiday Horse:::::It's New Year's Eve and The Saddle Club is baby-sitting so that Max and Deborah Regnery can have a night off. The Saddle Club think it will be a peaceful evening, full of Monopoly, New Year's resolutions, and talking. They didn't count on 6-month-old Maxi. She's cute. She's adorable. But she isn't ready to go to bed. The Saddle Club have to give up their plans and spend the night playing with her until she finally tires out. Then a late night phone call sends the three friends to the aid of a neighboring stable's horses. But what about Maxi? Looks like she's about to get her first riding lesson from The Saddle Club.
