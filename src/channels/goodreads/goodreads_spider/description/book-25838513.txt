25838513:::::Unlawful Desire:::::My fianc e ripped a piece of my heart out when I caught her with another man. It made me jaded, and I swore off relationships. But as with any plans, life had a way of making me its bitch. When a way too young bombshell walked into my world, my heart began to beat again. Georgia asked me for one night nothing more and with no strings attached. Our night of passion turned my universe upside down. When she almost slipped out of my life, I knew I had to make her mine. Willing to do anything to protect her, I took justice into my own hands. My feelings for her brought out a side of me I thought I d left behind. I had to lose myself to be found again.
