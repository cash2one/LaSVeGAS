24764525:::::Torn:::::Three months have passed and Melina thought she was safe. Safe from the effects of the angel powers and safe from the Noxin demons. But she thought too soon. Just as she s starting to enjoy her new powers and her new relationship with Lee, the slight pain she still experiences after using the powers starts to grow worse. As the pain becomes more and more unbearable, she finds herself lashing out at innocent people with unexplained anger and hatred. Then to make matters worse, she sees a Noxin demon again. No one, not even the elders, seems to know what s happening to Melina, or how a Noxin demon found her. And when she s introduced to Dean, another unique human like herself, she learns that his pain is completely gone, which only makes her situation even more confusing. Grasping for any type of answer, Melina throws out one possible explanation after another. But as her angry feelings intensify, and her angel powers grow weaker, she begins to think there might be something malevolent inside her that s trying to take over. It s not long before her internal struggle spirals out of control, and her body is turned into a battlefield that s torn between good and evil. Melina fears that if no solution is found, then she might lose all the people she loves, especially Lee. But what scares her even more is that she might lose herself to evil.
