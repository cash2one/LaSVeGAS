701937:::::Spud:::::It s 1990. Apartheid is crumbling. Nelson Mandela has just been released from prison. And Spud Milton thirteen-year-old, prepubescent choirboy extraordinaire is about to start his first year at an elite boys-only boarding school in South Africa. Cursed with embarrassingly dysfunctional parents, a senile granny named Wombat, and a wild obsession for Julia Roberts, Spud has his hands full trying to adapt to his new home. Armed with only his wits and his diary, Spud takes readers of all ages on a rowdy boarding school romp full of illegal midnight swims, raging hormones, and catastrophic holidays that will leave the entire family in total hysterics and thirsty for more. Winner of South Africa s Booksellers Choice Award 2006
