21805738:::::Four Score:::::Love and hate aren t all that different. Two sides of the same coin, the yin and the yang. Once upon a time, Jason Ross loved me. And now that he knows what I ve done, I see the love and the hate warring within him. I see the way he looks at me. The way he wonders how I could do the things I ve done. I hear it in the way he begs me to stop, to leave this life and run away with him. But there s only one way I m leaving LA. And that ll be when Dornan and the rest of his sons are dead and buried. Jase might forgive me for what I ve done. But will he forgive me for the crimes I m yet to commit?
