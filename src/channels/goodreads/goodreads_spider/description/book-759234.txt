759234:::::The Heartbreakers:::::THREE BREAKUPS Sydney's longtime steady, Drew, unexpectedly bails. Raven can't decide between Caleb and Horace. They decide for her, and suddenly she's left with a sum total of zero boyfriends. Kelly's kinda-sorta boyfriend, Will, has plans for Valentine's Day. Just not with her. FOUR FRIENDS Alexia's never had a broken heart, but that's because she's never had a serious boyfriend. So when her three BFFs turn up boyless, she's sympathetic...but maybe secretly- selfishly-glad. She has her friends back. She just has to help them get over their heartaches. TWENTY-NINE RULES How else to get over the breakups but follow a few simple rules? It all goes well at first: There are girly sleepovers, cold shoulders, and the destruction of sentimental items. But even as the girls rediscover their friendship, rules are broken left and right. Soon the formerly heartbroken are on their way to becoming heartbreakers themselves. Especially Alexia.
