127437:::::Telling Christina Goodbye:::::Trisha Thompson and her best friend Christina are having a great senior year. Trisha and her boyfriend, Cody, are making plans to attend Indiana University together in the fall, while Christina has already received a scholarship to the University of Vermont. Everything would be perfect if only Trisha got along with Christina s controlling boyfriend Tucker, who is trying to convince Christina not to go away for college.

When his car hits a patch of black ice and overturns, Tucker walks away with barely a scratch, but Trisha is injured, Cody is in a coma, and Christina is dead. Those left behind must learn that it takes time for their scars both visible and not to heal. And they must find the courage to move on with their lives.
