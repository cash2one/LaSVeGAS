28369891:::::Lucas:::::In a sprint, every millisecond counts. When you re waiting for love, those milliseconds can feel like eons. High school senior Lucas Preston has it all: star of the track team, a scholarship waiting for him, an apartment to himself and a revolving door of girlfriends. He also has an older sister, five younger brothers and a father who relies on him to make sure those brothers don t kill each other. His saving grace? Lois Laney Sanders, a girl he started to fall in like with when he was just eleven. A girl who became his best friend, his confidant, his courage. It took only sixteen clicks and eight seconds for Lucas to realize that his like for Laney had turned into love. Eight life-changing seconds. It s also the exact length of time it took to lose her.
