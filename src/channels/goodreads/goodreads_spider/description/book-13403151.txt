13403151:::::No Love Lost:::::No Love Lost, the next best-selling novel to hit the bookstores. The author, J. W. Smith, captures the street life of a young man with similarities resembling his own life, beginning with the early childhood of Lil Jay and on into his manhood. Finally Smith brings the gut-wrenching truth of rigid living in a ghastly neighborhood and a twist of enlightenment to urban literature. Lil Jay is a young man growing up in the urban lifestyle of gang life in the early 1990s and late 1980s. The streets of Los Angeles, California, took power over his mind at a young age, yet he still manages to prevail from the uncertainty of life that only his hood could offer. With a drunken cracked-out trick for a father and a mother ready to thrash anyone who crosses her path, a troubled home life left him with very minimal options for his future. As a result, Lil Jay only had the streets to call home and the hood as his family. Crossing paths with sex and women, death and murderers, drug dealers and junkies, prostitutes and pimps, somewhere along the way he finds his true path. The sister of his mentor, Charlette, a high-class, well-educated woman, intrigues his inner thoughts. Finding himself with a long-term prison sentence, Jay never anticipated what would be waiting for him on the outside. Perseverance took control of his mind and bestowed upon him a different light, allowing him to flourish into a new man in God s glory.
