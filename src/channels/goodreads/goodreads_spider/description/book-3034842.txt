3034842:::::The Forbidden Tower:::::This is the novel of four who defied the powers of the matrix guardians - fanatics who protected those powers so that the planet of the ruddy sun might never fall beneath the influence of materialistic Terrans. The four who found themselves fused into a terrifying unity in that defiance were two men and two women. The men were Damon Ridenow, a Gomyn of the ruling caste, and Andrew Garr, the Earthman who had won for himself the right of clan-entry.
