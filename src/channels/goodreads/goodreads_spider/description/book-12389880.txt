12389880:::::Kiss of Death:::::For Young Adults: Sixteen year-old Lexi Hunter is just an ordinary teenager wishing that her life could be as exciting as a reality tv show when her mom receives a phone call with the news that Lexi's cousin, Austin, was killed. She and her mom return to Briar Creek, the town that they left ten years ago, never looking back. During their stay, Lexi falls head-over-heels for Gabe, the dark and mysterious guy who lives across the street and goes to the same high school that Austin went to. Lexi's Aunt Violet and Uncle Tommy insist on her staying away from him due to his violent behavior and instead urge her to pursue a relationship with Dan, Austin's best friend. In an effort to learn more about the cousin she barely knew, Lexi snoops through Austin's belongings. Soon, she begins to uncover puzzling details that make her believe that Austin wasn't really attacked by an animal the night he was killed - details that may already be putting her own life in danger.
