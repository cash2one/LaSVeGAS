16152129:::::Nova:::::Nova Reynolds is waiting tables to save enough money for her dream: to continue college so she can be accepted into a veterinarian program. When the offer to intern at a horse ranch is presented to her, she's beyond excited. Finally something is going her way. But the offer comes from the cute guy that's been frequenting her diner lately, and even though Nova was interested in Austin before he presented the idea, she feels like she can only choose one door and it's definitely not a boyfriend. Working at Harmony Acres becomes a dream come true and Nova quickly feels at home with her surroundings. But being around Austin becomes difficult as she tries to separate her personal life from her newly found professional one, and it doesn't help when he keeps himself in the running for her attention. From Austin's secret car racing career to a questionable friend from his past, there is always an obstacle threatening to keep them apart. Happiness is all Nova has ever wanted, but Austin's ambitious personality seems to keep it hanging in the balance...
