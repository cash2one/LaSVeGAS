12086913:::::In Blackness:::::The truth of our bloody future will reveal itself in blackness. Lenny and Saline are merely kids when their parents move them in with, Busek, an old family friend they ve never met. A few months later their parents are dead and they re left alone to cope in the small town of San Pedro. It doesn t help that Busek beats his son, Dustin, and doesn t seem to care for them. Flash forward almost a decade. Although the three kids are now young adults and good enough friends, they ve each found their own way to deal with their situation. Saline has hidden the fact for years that she s Born Again Christian. Ironically, a group of Christians offers her a chance to visit her old hometown for a supposed religious gathering. But it s not who is gathering there that sends her running for her life but rather what is gathering. Suddenly feeling the same pull towards their old town as his sister, Lenny follows Saline. On his travels he discovers the truth about his urge to be there and why that might mean the end of him. Back home, Dustin immerses himself in the intricacies of San Pedro. He and local anarchists are on the frontlines of an odd discovery, which on the outset seems like simple yet awkward workings of the city council. Instead they ve stumbled upon an event that will change the world as we know it. In Blackness is the predecessor to In Blackness: The Reinvention of Man, the second installment of three books chronicling the alien apocalypse.
