6717120:::::Gengis Khan Conquerant du monde:::::This book is intended as a brief summary of the life of Genghis Khan. As such it is a very readable &amp; easy to understand work. However it's clear that the book is merely touching the surface. The chapters are short &amp; they cover vast amounts of data. This book will introduce you to the man but it will leave you hungry for more. Perhaps that is the greatest compliment an author can receive.--Arch Stanton
