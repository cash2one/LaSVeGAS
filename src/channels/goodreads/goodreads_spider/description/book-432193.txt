432193:::::We Don't Live Here Anymore:::::In these three stories two of which form the basis of the award-winning film We Don t Live Here Anymore literary master Andre Dubus traces the lives of two couples who married too young, and who are intricately entwined by love and friendship, jealousy and understanding. Hank and Jack have been best friends since high school. Hank married Edith, the prettiest girl Jack had ever seen, and Jack married Terry, whom he thinks he may no longer love. But Hank and Edith s adultery didn t begin or end with Jack and Terry. Moving, perceptive, rendered in clear-eyed prose, We Don t Live Here Anymore maps with preternatural insight the often separate lands of love and marriage.
