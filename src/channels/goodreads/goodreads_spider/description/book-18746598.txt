18746598:::::Sounds of Silence:::::Twelve-year-old Marco Lippa is the star pitcher for his Little League baseball team and does his best to lead his team to victory against their cross-town rivals, reveling in the cheering and applause. After one particular game, he becomes sick and is rushed to the hospital. Treated for meningococcal disease, Marco wakes up to discover that he is deaf and all of his dreams seem to crumble. Now Marco must come to terms with living in a silent world and the grief, anger, and loss that seem to go with it. He is enrolled at the state boarding school for the deaf, leaving behind his comfortable home and his family and friends while he re-learns how to communicate and function without his hearing. As if that wasn't hard enough, he quickly discovers that being deaf does not exempt him from the normal anxieties he faced at home bullies, girls, and fitting in. Will he ever find his way back to his dreams?
