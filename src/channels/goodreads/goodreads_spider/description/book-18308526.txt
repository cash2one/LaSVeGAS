18308526:::::The Babel Codex:::::In this electrifying new novella, heroine Annja Creed uncovers yet another one of history's monsters. From the Old Testament comes a new danger... Fighting skeletons in Addis Ababa isn't in Annja's contract. Especially when they're "entertainment" rigged by an obnoxious radio DJ during the filming of the TV show she hosts, Chasing History's Monsters. But the accidental discovery of an ancient clay brick turns the prank into deadly peril for the intrepid archaeologist. If Annja's hunch is right, the brick is merely the first key to a greater discovery: the Tower of Babel. Now, with Joan of Arc's sword in hand and killers at her heels, she must race across the Middle East to unravel the puzzle first. Enemies and allies will face off against each other - and themselves. To survive, Annja will have to defeat them all...because in the end there can be only one winner.
