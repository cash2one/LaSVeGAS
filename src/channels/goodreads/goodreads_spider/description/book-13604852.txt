13604852:::::Mystique:::::From beyond the boundaries of infinity and the vastness of Immortal consciousness, a prophecy had been conceived within the majestic expanse of the unbound universe and as a result, the Mystique have sprung from the womb of Mother Earth like the phoenix rising up from the still burning embers of, The Desert of Reality . Upon the death of his beloved Cortessa, Demonno was literally drove beyond the brink of insanity and throughout the ageless millenniums, he had taken it upon himself to single handedly wipe his own species off the face of the planet. Violet, nearly the last living Mystique in existence, has finally come upon the end of her inevitable journey. Despite the destruction of her species, bitter betrayals and malignant diversities, Violet has still managed to fulfill a prophecy that was perhaps as ancient as time and space itself. Violet must ultimately pass Samantha Jean Doven- the mothering host of a new breed of Mystique -the proverbial scepter to continue the self-sacrificing journey that she has no choice but to forfeit. However, in the aftermath of Demonno s reign of terror, he continues his contaminated trail of destruction and will stop at absolutely nothing to finish what he has started and destroy all Mystiques, along with anything or anyone who is unfortunate enough to cross his path. Samantha must stop this insane beast of hatred and rage and save humankind not only from themselves, but Demonno as well. Samantha must find the strength within to carry the Mystique and humankind alike into a new age and a new millennium, because a new time and existence is about to begin. What is life? Life is the decisions we choose to make woven among our destiny and in the end, all is as it should be.
