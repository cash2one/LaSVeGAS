16197019:::::Poetry and Short Stories by a Bipolar Girl:::::This book was written by a young woman with bipolar disorder, who wrote poems and short stories both in her manic and depressed states. It's meant to shed some light on bipolar disorder and depression for those who don't suffer from those things, know someone who does or just want to understand what goes through the mind of someone with mental illness. It's also meant to show those who go through the same things that they aren't alone. And while doing all of that, it's also just a fun book to read.
