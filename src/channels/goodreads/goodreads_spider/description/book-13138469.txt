13138469:::::An Alpha's Path:::::Melanie Cross knew nothing of the world beyond her books and thought that was all she needed. When she finds herself on a blind date with a shifter who says she s his mate, she finds out otherwise. Kade Jamenson knows one day he will be the Alpha of the Redwood Pack but first, he must find his mate. Somehow fate has put her in his path in the most unlikely of ways, but when another tries to block them before they can complete the mating bond, he ll stop at nothing to keep Melanie safe. As temptation burns bright, two of them must overcome what they thought were differences and fight for something more than a mere night: fate.
