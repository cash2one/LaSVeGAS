23000635:::::Dogshit Saved My Life:::::My goal, my life s ambition if you like, is to give direction to comedy, purpose to satire. And this is probably why I write the way I do, in order to use self-deprecating, piss-taking humour to bring to the fore situations that just don t stack up. To demonstrate that serious issues can be approached with humour. Hardly any subject is taboo to the Englishman when he s laughing, and this often seems insensitive to other cultures, but the bedrock of the British sense of humour is a strong sense of sarcasm and self-deprecation. The British can be very passionate and if you doubt that try going to a football match - but that passion is often hidden deep in our humour so that other nationals fail to not only recognise the deadpan delivery and are never too sure if they ve been involved in a serious conversation or just a little bit of friendly banter. Having said that my style of writing is now appealing more and more to the American market. This book is not a novel, and if you re looking for a book that is all sweetness and light, please give this one a miss. It s not for you. I won t be offended and I honestly wish you a great life. If everyone likes me, then I m not being controversial enough. If you re looking for Humorous books about Life, Comedy Writing or even Humorous Books for Adults then take a chance on this book If a chapter doesn t suit, just move on.
