17999968:::::Amarantos-One That Never Withers:::::In a time long ago, a hunter of souls traded mortal life for pouches of gold... Hana awoke in an unfamiliar English manor, amnesiac to the present, yet with vivid memories of a distant past. With the help of resident psychologist Dr. Beth Seer, she will return to her time, unraveling a skein of memories. Within it lies a journey into an age of darkness, where a loved one s quest for immortality turns into the betrayal of another, pitting promises to murder. Vengeance belies justice, and it is up to a young thief taker named Jean-Claude Lamont to keep her on course and away from the hangman s noose. Yet within her lies a wildcat warrior that cannot be tamed, and for him, the woman he cannot live without. Through their struggles, their hearts bind as one, and together, they must end the madness that befalls them a mission that will ultimately test logic against ancient beliefs and mystical lore. That was then ... and now all she wants is to return to him and the life that was. How will these memories affect her present and future? Only time will tell. Lost am I, in a nightmare from which I cannot awaken.
