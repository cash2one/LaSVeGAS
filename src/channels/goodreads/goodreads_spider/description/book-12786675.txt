12786675:::::The Serial Killer's Diet Book:::::Fred Orbis is fat. Very fat, and he wants to be thin. He is editor of Feast Magazine, the magazine devoted to over-eating, but he dreams of being Federico Orbisini, internationally known novelist, existential philosopher, raconteur, and lover of women. Darby Montana is heiress to the massive Polk's Peanut Roll fortune and one of the world's richest women, but her face and body have the indifferent plainness of a rectangle. Her deepest desire is to be beautiful. Elizabeth Aphelion is a young poet, who in an impetuous night of passion surrenders her body and will to Jacqueline Jimson-Weed, her imperious college professor, for the promise of her book being published. Mr. Monde is the refined older gentleman in the modest brownstone on 54th Street who may or may not be the Devil in the market for a soul or two. And Devon DeGroot is a New York City homicide detective who just may be the reincarnation of George Washington, readying himself for a final showdown with evil on the streets of Manhattan. **** "The Serial Killer's Diet Book" is "Catch-22" meets Rabelais and Joyce. It's an hilarious Faustian satire and a reflection on morals, God and the Devil, heaven and hell, beauty, literature and the bestseller list, and through it all the universal longing to become someone else.
