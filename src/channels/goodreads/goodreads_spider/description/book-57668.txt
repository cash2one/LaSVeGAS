57668:::::The Rebellion of the Hanged:::::The Rebellion of the Hanged is the fifth of B. Traven's six legendary Jungle Novels which together form an epic of the birth of the Mexican Revolution. Set in the slave-labor mahogany plantations of tropical Mexico in 1910, at the time of the uprising against the rule of Porfirio Diaz and the beginnings of revolution, Rebellion is a powerful and somber tale of the tortures suffered by downtrodden Indians. But here it culminates in a revolt by the long-oppressed workers against the owners and overseers of the camps, and in a treacherous march through the jungles at the height of the rainy season - a human feat of epic proportions.
