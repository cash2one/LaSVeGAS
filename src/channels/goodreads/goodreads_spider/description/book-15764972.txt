15764972:::::The Warrior's Game:::::Widowed Lady Amicia de la Beres has resisted taking sides in the rebellion forming against King John. But when England s king gives her precious home to an upstart common knight, one of John s greedy foreign mercenaries, Ami will do anything to protect what is hers. All Sir Michel de Martigny wants from King John is what was promised him the wife and estate that will make gentlemen of his sons. As a knighted commoner, he expects nothing more than scorn from the well-born woman who will be his wife. But then he discovers he is the one man Amicia needs more than she can imagine, for only he can protect her from their king's game.
