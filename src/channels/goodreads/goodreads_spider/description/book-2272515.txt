2272515:::::Heck: Where the Bad Kids Go:::::WHEN MILTON AND Marlo Fauster die in a marshmallow bear explosion, they get sent straight to Heck, an otherworldly reform school. Milton can understand why his kleptomaniac sister is here, but Milton is or was a model citizen. Has a mistake been made? Not according to Bea Elsa Bubb, the Principal of Darkness. She doesn t make mistakes. She personally sees to it that Heck whether it be home-ec class with Lizzie Borden, ethics with Richard Nixon, or gym with Blackbeard the Pirate is especially, well, heckish for the Fausters. Will Milton and Marlo find a way to escape? Or are they stuck here for all eternity, or until they turn 18, whichever comes first?
