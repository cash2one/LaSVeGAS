17796115:::::Reckless Endangerment:::::Heroes come in many forms--soldiers who fall and rise, ordinary people doing extraordinary things, women who battle for their marriage, reporters who fight for truth and justice, and men who put it all on the line for the women they love. Sometimes heroes fall. Colonel Michael Cedars is a decorated war hero returning home from Afghanistan. Wounded, unsure if he ll walk again, he s not sure how he fits in civilian life, and he definitely questions if he wants to remain married to the feisty redhead, Hope Shane. Hope s never been one to play it safe. She met the Colonel while working as a war correspondent, fell in love with the man in uniform, watched him get blown up, and isn t willing to give up on him now. Back in Denver, Colorado, she s working as an investigative reporter who becomes entangled in a human trafficking story. As the danger of her story intensifies, Hope and Michael are tested more than they ever imagined. Will Michael be able to see beyond what he s lost to embrace what remains? Is he still the man she married or has he become a liability that could get her killed? Is he still the hero she claims him to be? Will her reckless pursuit of justice endanger the life they ve pieced together?
