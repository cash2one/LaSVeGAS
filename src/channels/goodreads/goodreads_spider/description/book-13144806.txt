13144806:::::Junia Is Not Alone:::::In this fierce essay, leading Bible scholar Scot McKnight tells the story of Junia, a female apostle honored by Paul in his Letter to the Romans--and then silenced and forgotten for most of church history. But Junia's tragedy is not hers alone. She's joined by fellow women in the Bible whose stories of bold leadership have been overlooked. She's in the company of visionary women of God throughout the centuries whose names we've forgotten, whose stories go untold, and whose witness we neglect to celebrate. But Junia is also joined by women today--women who are no longer silent and who are experiencing a re-voicing as they respond to God's call to lead us into all truth. (Patheos Press)
