11027794:::::Tobacco-Stained Mountain Goat:::::Cut to Melbourne, Australia the most glamourous city in the world. It also happens to be the only one left standing, but nevermind that, we're there now and I'd like you to meet your narrator, a certain Floyd Maquina, a likeable chap with one hell of a story to share. See, the powers that be are knuckling down on the Deviant menace that plagues the city, and our boy Floyd's unknowingly got himself in the thick of it. Cue guns, intrigue, kidnappings, conspiracy and all sorts of general mayhem that make for cracking good headlines.Does Floyd stop the bad guys? Does he get the girl? Does he make Humphrey Bogart proud? Grab some popcorn and read on. Ostensibly an exploration of a dystopian near-future with its feet placed firmly in the terrains of noir, sci-fi and pulp fiction, 'TSMG' has received rave reviews from dozens of sources including reviewer Elizabeth A. White ("one of the most creative and engaging books I ve ever read"), SF Book Reviews ("completely unexpected and with such a wonderfully rich and unique style that is simply mesmerizing, unmissable") and Lip Magazine ("Such an engrossing and visual read gorgeous, subtle moments in there as well").
