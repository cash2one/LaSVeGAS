4992745:::::Genocide: My Stolen Rwanda:::::""My Stolen Rwanda "should be required reading for every diplomat, journalist, aid worker and UN official dealing with Africa."Adam LeBor, author of "Complicity with Evil: The United Nations in the Age of Modern Genocide" "The eyes of your assassin. They stay in your mind's eye until death." For thirteen days in April 1994, Reverien Rurangwa hid in silence with his family in a tiny cabin on the side of a mountain until they were finally hunted down by their Hutu neighbors--men with whom his father had often drunk a beer after work. In minutes, forty-three members of his family were massacred in front of his eyes. Although part of his hand was cut off, Rurangwa managed to escape before the assassins set fire to the building. Rurangwa was fifteen and alone in the world; his only souvenir of his childhood was a battered family photograph. He tried to return to his home but was once again forced to flee in fear of his life. In this extraordinary memoir of survival, Rurangwa recounts how he struggled to come to terms with extreme loss, physical deformity, and a life in exile. Published to commemorate the fifteenth anniversary of the genocide, "My Stolen Rwanda" is tender and intimate. Rurangwa's story jumps from the pages with energy and even humor. Part of the proceeds from the sale of "My Stolen Rwanda" will go to Ibuka--Memory and Justice, which supports victims of the genocide. Rurangwa is the charity's vice president.
