18308403:::::Unbreak My Heart:::::Brett Taylor has been doing just fine living in his little world of grief and pain for the past three years thank you very much. Losing someone special is life changing, and Brett doesn't understand why everyone and their damn dog thinks they can get all up in his business about moving on. He's accepted his job going from musician to rancher without relying on anyone else's opinion, and he doesn't need some city kid coming into his life to break the habits he's been practicing grief, isolation, and a whole lot of Jack Daniels. JT Campbell was on a quest to escape his old life, and to figure out who he is and where he belonged as he moved from one meaningless job to the next. He wasn't looking to save anyone, let alone a secretive, hotter-than-hell rancher who wore his heart on his sleeve. He likes working for Brett, but it's been made perfectly clear that any relationship other than professional will never see the light of day. But when JT's lust turns to love, and he gives in to his desire to find out what makes Brett tick, will his patience and support result in Brett lowering the walls he's built-up enough so JT can unbreak his heart?
