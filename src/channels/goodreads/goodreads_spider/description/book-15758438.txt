15758438:::::My Liege of Dark Haven:::::Threatened by university cutbacks, Professor Abigail Bern s only hope is to publish a provocative research paper--soon. Planning to covertly observe behavior in the notorious Dark Haven BDSM club, she takes a receptionist job. When the owner calls upon her to assist in a demonstration, she s appalled. Then fascinated. Under the unyielding hands of the master known as my Liege, she discovers a need to be more than an observer. His late wife had been the center of his life, and Xavier Leduc wants no other. But when his new receptionist does her utmost to keep an emotional distance from him, he s intrigued and digs deeper. She s adorable. Intriguingly intelligent, beautifully submissive, sweetly vulnerable. He soon realizes her defenses are keeping her on the fringe of her sexuality--and her life. As he draws her into fuller participation, she unconsciously does the same for him. She begins to fill his world. Ever since the night she met my Liege Xavier, Abby has questioned everything she believes about herself. She s falling for the stern owner of Dark Haven and thinks he s beginning to care for her...until the day he learns why she s in his club.
