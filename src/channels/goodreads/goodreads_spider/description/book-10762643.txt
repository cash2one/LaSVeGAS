10762643:::::The UnTied Kingdom:::::The portal to an alternate world was the start of all her troubles or was it? When Eve Carpenter lands with a splash in the Thames, it s not the London or England she s used to. No one has a telephone or knows what a computer is. England s a third world country and Princess Di is still alive. But worst of all, everyone thinks Eve s a spy. Including Major Harker who has his own problems. His sworn enemy is looking for a promotion. The general wants him to undertake some ridiculous mission to capture a computer, which Harker vaguely envisions running wild somewhere in Yorkshire. Turns out the best person to help him is Eve. She claims to be a popstar. Harker doesn t know what a popstar is, although he suspects it s a fancy foreign word for spy . Eve knows all about computers, and electricity. Eve is dangerous. There s every possibility she s mad. And Harker is falling in love with her.
