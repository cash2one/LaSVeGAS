20959438:::::Beautiful Ink:::::Family. I have tattooed that single word on more skin than I care to count. It elicits powerful thoughts and emotions for most people. Loving. Caring. Supportive. Togetherness. Forever. But not for me. The word family means so much more. Vicious. Harmful. Dangerous. Corrupt. Deadly. You can t run forever from the ones who love you. Note: This novel is not a cliffhanger and can be read as a standalone. Warning: This book is real, beautifully raw, and not for the faint of heart. It is the story of a young girl s loss of innocence while growing up around a motorcycle club. It is not suitable for children under the age of seventeen due to language, sexual content, and intense subject matter. Based on true events.
