22365:::::New X-Men: Omnibus:::::Sixteen million mutants dead...and that was just the beginning. In one bold stroke, writer Grant Morrison ( The Invisibles , JLA , Fantastic Four: 1234 ) propelled the X-Men into the 21st century - masterminding a challenging new direction for Marvel's mutant heroes that began with the destruction of Genosha and never let up. Regarded as the most innovative thinker of the current comic-book renaissance, Morrison proceeded to turn the mutant-hero genre on its ear. Gone were the gaudy spandex costumes - replaced by slick, black leather and an attitude to match. Now, his entire Eisner Award -nominated run on New X-Men is collected in one Omnibus. Collecting : New X-Men 114-154, Annual 2001
