221639:::::PHP String Handling Handbook:::::This work covers all the most important tasks related to dealing with text/strings in PHP. The core of the book looks at PHP's built in string functions and the two flavours of Regular Expressions that PHP supports. String handling functions and Regular expressions basically solve many of the problems but in a very different way. This book doesn't just look at how to use them but when and where each is appropriate and what affect that choice has on performance.
