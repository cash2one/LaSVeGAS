353303:::::The Light Heart:::::Lovely Phoebe Sprague, of Williamsburg, Virginia, became engaged to her childhood sweetheart just before she set sail for England - where she fell headlong in love with Captain Oliver Campion. But in 1902 a betrothal was almost as binding as marriage, and Phoebe, who meant to abide by her promise, changed her mind too late. There was noting that either Phoebe or Oliver could do about it; separated initially be convention, they were soon to be whirled apart by the tumultuous events of history itself. In telling this fascinating story of two great loves, Miss Thane presents the reader with a brilliant and crowded panorama of the carefree days in England and Europe before 1914. The saga which she unfolded in Ever After, Yankee Stranger and Dawn's Early Light is here carried forwarded more ably than ever in the recreation of a glowing, unforgettable era, when Europe still danced, society was still glamorous, and tragedy wore a smiling mask.
