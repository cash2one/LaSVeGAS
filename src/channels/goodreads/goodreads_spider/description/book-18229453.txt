18229453:::::God, Save the Pirate:::::A pirate's most valuable treasure is buried in the heart of one woman. Aislin is wrongly convicted of her own father's murder. Although innocent, she is sentenced to a prison colony in Australia. The prison ship winds up too far west, where the murderous pirate, Captain Jackson, is said to rule the seas. Her pleas to God seem to go unheeded as the ship is attacked and taken by the formidable buccaneer. Although she fights it with everything she has in her, Aislin can't help but fall in love with the pirate captain who captured her. Captain Gabriel Jackson is a pirate of a different breed. Playing the part of a bloodthirsty brigand, he finds himself coming to the aid of the enchanting maiden almost against his will. As they both struggle to survive in a vicious world, they are drawn together by an unseen force. Why? Because God knows that through Aislin and her love for Him, the prayer of God, Save the Pirate may finally come true.
