18721065:::::Baudelaire Poems:::::Will is a 26-year-old young man, insecure and confused, who has to go on a dangerous and unconventional road trip to find answers. He leaves Miami after weeks of alcohol and self-deprecation, trying to understand why he has dropped out of college, given all his money to a beautiful, mysterious girl and why he cannot remember a single thing. He travels to Atlanta, Memphis, Denver and flies to Seattle, meeting peculiar characters and delivering hot letters (art smuggling), in the attempt to find Amy and take care of her pregnancy. However, nothing is as simple as it seems and Will discovers a lot of terrible things about his family, his ex-girlfriend and himself. The point of view changes constantly and provides multiple perspectives to the reader. Free indirect speech, flashbacks, literary references and unusual narrating voices build up a fascinating puzzle, which flows page after page thanks to a unique style. Get ready for an amazing journey!
