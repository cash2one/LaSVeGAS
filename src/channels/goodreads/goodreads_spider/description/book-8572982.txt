8572982:::::Diabetes Without Drugs: The 5-Step Program to Control Blood Sugar Naturally and Prevent Diabetes Complications:::::Based on breakthrough studies, Cohen's program reveals how people with diabetes can reduce their need for prescription medication and minimize the disease's effect on the body. Most doctors consider diabetes a one-way street once you have it, your only option is to manage the symptoms with a restricted diet, close monitoring of blood sugar, and expensive medications. Pharmacist Suzy Cohen shows that diabetes can be treated instead through safe, natural means, like food and vitamins, rather than strictly relying on prescription drugs. She shifts the focus away from glucose management to a whole body approach, using supplements, minerals, and dietary changes to lose weight, repair cell damage, improve insulin function, and reduce the side effects from prescription drugs, many of which rob nutrients from the body and cause additional symptoms. This 5-step program uses natural alternatives, such as drinking nutrition-packed green drinks, adding vitamin D and anti-inflammatory supplements, increasing fiber intake, and including minerals in the diet to help restore the body's own supply of insulin. Diabetes without Drugs explains how patients can protect their heart, kidneys, eyesight, and limbs from the damage often caused by diabetes and shows the impact that the right foods and the right supplements can make in reducing blood sugar levels, aiding weight loss, and restoring vibrant health to everyone with diabetes.
