The club is his life, and he ll do whatever it takes to keep his brothers safe. He s a man who keeps to himself, guarding the walls that he secured so long ago. Then, one moment, one chance meeting, changes everything. Wren Life for Wren and her son, Wyatt, isn t exactly easy. Yet, Wren faces each day with determination and courage. Wyatt is her joy and motivation; for him, she will find a way to make their lives better, even when obstacles are continually thrown in her path. The last thing she needs is another complication, but what is life without hurdles to overcome? Stitch appears when they need him the most, protecting them when no one else can. Wren can t understand it. She should feel threatened by his bulging muscles and menacing tattoos, but she s somehow able to see past the mysterious biker to the man inside. She is drawn to him for reasons she can t even begin to comprehend. All she knows is that her body craves his touch. Can Stitch let his guard down and allow these two strangers into his heart? Can Wren see beyond the scars of her past long enough to let him in, or will her fear drive him away?
