6388743:::::The Ghosts of Belfast:::::Stuart Neville has written not jut a superb thriller but a significant work of literature which explores the themes of sectarian hatred, individual responsibility, guilt, and redemption. This is an unforgettable debut. Fegan has been a hard man, an IRA killer in Northern Ireland who served a dozen years in the Maze Prison. Now that peace has come, he is being haunted, day and night, by the ghosts of twelve of his innocent victims: a mother and infant, a schoolboy, a butcher, a member of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, and seven others. In order to appease them, he s going to have to kill the men who gave him his orders. But for the first time in his life he's fallen in love with Marie McKenna, a woman who has a little girl. She had taken an RUC officer as a lover and is still shunned for this act of disloyalty. Marie and her daughter offer Fegan the prospect of a new life, and the possibility of redemption. But they are also potential hostages, which makes doing what he has to do much harder. Is this Fegan s ultimate mistake? As the mother of a boy he killed once told him, " Sooner or later, everybody pays. " " The best first novel I've read in years. It crackles. It grips you by the throat. It's a flat-out terror trip. This is some guy to watch out for in a dark alley. " James Ellroy " Not only one of the finest thriller debuts of the last ten years, but also one of the best Irish novels, in any genre, of recent times. " John Connolly
