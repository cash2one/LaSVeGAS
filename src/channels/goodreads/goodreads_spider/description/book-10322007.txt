10322007:::::Easton:::::Having just escaped the King s justice, notorious pirate Peter Easton arrives in St. John s harbour with ten well-armed ships. Knowing he is too powerful to be refused, Easton confidently invites the King s loyal fishing admiral, Richard Whitbourne, and his second-in-command, Captain Dawson, aboard his flagship The Happy Adventure . Insisting Whitbourne and Dawson are guests and not prisoners, Easton takes them by surprise, pulling anchor and setting sail with half his flotilla for the Caribbean. Easton takes place in Newfoundland, the Caribbean, and England. The story reflects a time when Newfoundland was crucial to trade and power, and when there was a very thin line between loyalty and piracy a line that could be crossed in either direction in the blink of an eye.
