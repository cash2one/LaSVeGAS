195016:::::The Horsemaster:::::It began with dreams - dreams of a mysterious flying horse that took Jessica high above the trees. The dreams felt so real, she was almost sure that they were. And then she and her friend Jack found an old tapestry in an abandoned farmhouse. The hose on the tapestry matched Jessica's dream-horse - and when she learned his name, Gabdon, both she and Jack were thrust headlong into another time and land from which they could only hope to find their way home. "Time travel, a mysterious tapestry, and a gutsy heroine add punch to this strong fantasy. Singer does an exceptional job. . . . This book is highly recommended."--School Library Journal.
