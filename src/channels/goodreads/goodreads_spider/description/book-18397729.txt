18397729:::::Grog Wars:::::Who will win the war for love and beer? A self-made German brewer would willingly give it all for the love of his woman--while another, lesser man would seek to take it all and rid of the woman. Let the battles begin Forced into an arranged marriage and dispatched to a strange new country, a German Brew Master learned he would do almost anything for love. In 1849, Burke Kaufmann survived the first leg of his journey: the cross Atlantic voyage and the "floating coffin ships." Then he endured the Oregon Trail during its bloodiest history, with Aussie pal Queensy Gray in tow, and in due course he landed in Portland, Oregon--"Shanghai capital," and arguably the most dangerous place on earth.
