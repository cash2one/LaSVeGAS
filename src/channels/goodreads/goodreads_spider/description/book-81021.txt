81021:::::Angela Carter's Book of Fairy Tales:::::Once upon a time fairy tales weren't meant just for children, and neither is Angela Carter's Book of Fairy Tales . This collection contains lyrical tales, bloody tales and hilariously funny and ripely bawdy stories from countries all around the world - from the Arctic to Asia - and no dippy princesses or soppy fairies. Instead, we have pretty maids and old crones; crafty women and bad girls; enchantresses and midwives; rascal aunts and odd sisters.
