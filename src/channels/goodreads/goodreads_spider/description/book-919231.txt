919231:::::The World at Night:::::Paris, 1940. The civilized, upper-class life of film producer Jean Casson is derailed by the German occupation of Paris, but Casson learns that with enough money, compromise, and connections, one need not deny oneself the pleasures of Parisian life. Somewhere inside Casson, though, is a stubborn romantic streak. When he s offered the chance to take part in an operation of the British secret service, this idealism gives him the courage to say yes.

Here is a brilliant re-creation of France its spirit in the moment of defeat, its valor in the moment of rebirth.
