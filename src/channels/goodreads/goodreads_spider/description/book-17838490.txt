17838490:::::Playlist for the Dead:::::Here s what Sam knows: There was a party. There was a fight. The next morning, Sam s best friend, Hayden, was dead. All he left Sam was a playlist of songs and a note, saying that he took his own life. But what Sam doesn t know is: Why? To figure out what happened, Sam has to rely on the playlist and his own memory. But the more he listens, the more he realizes that his memory isn t as reliable as he thought. Especially when someone claiming to be Hayden starts sending him cryptic messages, and a series of violent attacks begins on the bullies who made Hayden s life hell. Sam knows he has to face up to what happened the night. But it s only by taking out his earbuds and opening his eyes to the people around him including an eccentric, unpredictable girl who s got secrets, too that Sam will finally be able to piece together his best friend s story. And maybe have a chance to change his own.
