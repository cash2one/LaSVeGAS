926225:::::Final Justice at Adobe Wells:::::This time Brannon heads south of the border to buy cattle for his ranch. But he finds the cattle rustled and their owner murdered. Brannon comes up against something a lot bigger than just a band of small-time rustlers. A former Confederate officer stole the herd to finance his private army. Captain Porter has devised a fantastic scheme to "liberate" Baja California, supposedly for the Confederacy. But Porter should have picked someone else's cattle. Army or no army, Brannon is not about to let him walk away with his livestock. Meanwhile Stuart gets reacquainted with the widow Victoria Pacifica and discovers they have much in common. His admiration grows for this amazing woman. Will she succeed in getting Brannon to lay to rest the ghost of his dead wife where others have failed?
