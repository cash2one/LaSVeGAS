12429:::::Princess in Love:::::This is a love affair too special to be kept a secret. The woman was Diana, Princess of Wales; the man was Captain James Hewitt. Their love was both passionate and full of hope, yet ultimately hopeless. Once the disintegration of the marriage of Prince Charles and Princess Diana had become public knowledge, the world quickly learned of the affair; and not knowing the truth, the world quickly condemned James Hewitt. Now the truth can be known: that his love, support, and encouragement played a vital role in helping Princess Diana through her marriage breakdown and enabling her to develop the inner strength she displayed after her separation from Prince Charles. Theirs was a love that arose through force of circumstance. This book shows why and how they were drawn together to a romance that lasted nearly five years. Black-and-white photos.
