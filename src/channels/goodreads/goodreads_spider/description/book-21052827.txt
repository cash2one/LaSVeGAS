21052827:::::The Hodgeheg:::::Max is a hedgehog who lives with his family in a nice little home, but unfortunately on the wrong side of the road from the Park, with its beautiful lily pond, and more importantly its juicy slugs, worms and snails! The busy road is a dangerous barrier but Max notices that humans seem to cross it quite easily. If they can, why can't hedgehogs? So Max sets out on a quest to find a safe way to reach the Park. His first attempt ends in a nasty bump on the head, and Max finds when he tries to speak his words are all mixed up. He is now a Hodgeheg, not a hedgehog, but he is still determined to fulfil his mission. After some careful detective work, Max eventually discovers the best way to cross the road - with the help of the lollipop lady, of course!
