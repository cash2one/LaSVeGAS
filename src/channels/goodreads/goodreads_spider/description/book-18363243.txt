18363243:::::Going Down in Flames:::::If her love life is going down in flames, she might as well spark a revolution. Finding out on your sixteenth birthday you re a shape-shifting dragon is tough to swallow. Being hauled off to an elite boarding school is enough to choke on. Since Bryn is the only crossbreed at the Institute for Excellence, all eyes are on her, but it s a particular black dragon, Zavien, who catches her attention. Zavien is tired of the Council s rules. Segregated clans, being told who to love, and close-minded leaders make freedom of choice almost impossible. The new girl with the striped hair is a breath of fresh air, and with Bryn s help, they may be able to change the rules. At the Institute, old grudges, new crushes, and death threats are all part of a normal day for Bryn. She ll need to learn to control her dragon powers if she wants to make it through her first year at school. But even focusing on staying alive is difficult when you re falling for someone you can't have.
