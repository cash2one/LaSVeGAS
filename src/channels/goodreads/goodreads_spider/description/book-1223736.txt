1223736:::::Roar!: A Noisy Counting Book:::::One day, while great big lions lie basking in the sun, a little lion cub goes off to find some fun. Roars the little lion cub. "Who will play with me? 1 red monkey rushes up a tree. Poor little lion cub! All he wants is someone to play with, but he is simply too noisy. As the little lion cub Roars his way across the grassland, young picture-book readers can count the African animals,identify them by color...and Roars along too. This rollicking, Roaring poem, about a rambunctious little lion cub, is a collaboration of the talented author and illustrator team Pamela Duncan Edwards and Henry Cole.
