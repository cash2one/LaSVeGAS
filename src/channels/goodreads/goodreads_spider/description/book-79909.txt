79909:::::In Patagonia:::::An exhilarating look at a place that still retains the exotic mystery of a far-off, unseen land, Bruce Chatwin s exquisite account of his journey through Patagonia teems with evocative descriptions, remarkable bits of history, and unforgettable anecdotes. Fueled by an unmistakable lust for life and adventure and a singular gift for storytelling, Chatwin treks through the uttermost part of the earth that stretch of land at the southern tip of South America, where bandits were once made welcome in search of almost forgotten legends, the descendants of Welsh immigrants, and the log cabin built by Butch Cassidy. An instant classic upon publication in 1977, In Patagonia is a masterpiece that has cast a long shadow upon the literary world.
