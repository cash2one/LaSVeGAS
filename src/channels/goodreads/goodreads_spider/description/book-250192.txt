250192:::::The Buddha In Daily Life: An Introduction to the Buddhism of Nichiren Daishonin:::::Nam-myoho-renge-kyo . . . Nam-myoho-renge-kyo . . . Perhaps because it does not involve conforming to a specific lifestyle, the Buddhism of Nichiren Daishonin has attracted millions of adherents around the world during recent years. Its message is simply that those who commit themselves in faith, study and practice will achieve their goals and be moved to dedicate themselves to the wider cause of human happiness, world peace and environmental harmony. In this comprehensive and helpful book, the late Richard Causton, chairman of the lay society of those who practise the Buddhism of Nichiren Daishonin in the UK, explains the teachings and practice of the movement. He sets it into its international and historical perspective and gives many examples of how individuals and their families can overcome their problems and begin to reveal their full potential. 'It teaches that the state of Buddhahood can be attained by anyone within everyday life...' THE SUNDAY TIMES
