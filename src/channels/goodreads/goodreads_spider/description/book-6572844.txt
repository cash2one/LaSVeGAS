Two: she s got a killer stalking her an Other rogue set on gifting her bloody corpses, not to mention nights lying awake in terror. Small wonder she s been having bad luck with men. But the bounty hunter on her new case isn t worried about any of that. Jude Donovan is a shapeshifter himself, and the new DA s midnight hair and addictive scent tell him all he thinks he needs to know: She s gorgeous, she s definitely not human, and she s bringing out the animal in him in a really good way.
