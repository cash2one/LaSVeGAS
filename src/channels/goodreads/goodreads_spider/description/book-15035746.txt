15035746:::::The Last Sunset:::::Love is much more than a day at the beach. It can heal the wounds of childhood and can span long beyond the grave. Set in a small town in Michigan. The Last Sunset chronicles the unexpected and heart-warming journey of Steve Hadley - a college student forced into community service as punishment for a college prank. While not-so quietly doing his time at the Pioneer Manor Nursing Home, Hadley meets 83 year-old Moses Bailey, whose sole remaining wish is to see the sunset over Lake Michigan one final time. As he learns about Bailey's life, loves and broken dreams, Hadley unexpectedly finds himself on his own surprising and heart-wrenching story of love and romance. Blending flashbacks of the man facing his last sunset, with the youthful hopes and desires of a college student hoping to spend many more with the woman he loves, The Last Sunset is a thoughtful, poignant and ultimately inspirational tale.
