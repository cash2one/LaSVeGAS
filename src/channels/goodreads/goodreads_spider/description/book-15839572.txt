15839572:::::Mr. Red Riding Hoode:::::The better to make you mine, my dear When it came down to saving his best friend Ben s relationship, Steven Hoode didn't hesitate to trade his Florida timeshare for a month at Red Wolf Lodge. Cold weather isn't his favorite thing, but hot snow bunnies are, so he plans to make the most of his vacation. Good karma kicks in when he sees a pretty brunette chatting with the lodge owner. All thoughts of nuptials and nookie take a back seat to the heat that flares between them. When Graciela Chela Mendoza catches sight of the gorgeous man shivering in a red-hooded parka, she realizes why he makes her heart beat faster. He s her mate. The problem? Steven has no idea his friends are Wolves. Chela plans to break it to him gently, but when he accidently witnesses the whole Pack shifting, things get a bit hairy. He bolts, locking himself in his cabin and refusing to listen, even to Ben. Unless she can get him to see that Wolves are people, too, Chela will lose her mate faster than she can say woof. Warning: This book contains explicit sex, graphic language, a man packing some nice goodies and a she-Wolf all ready to gobble them up.
