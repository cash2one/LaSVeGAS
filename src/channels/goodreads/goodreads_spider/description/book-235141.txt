235141:::::The Structural Transformation of the Public Sphere: An Inquiry Into a Category of Bourgeois Society:::::This is J rgen Habermas's most concrete historical-sociological book and one of the key contributions to political thought in the postwar period. It will be a revelation to those who have known Habermas only through his theoretical writing to find his later interests in problems of legitimation and communication foreshadowed in this lucid study of the origins, nature, and evolution of public opinion in democratic societies.
