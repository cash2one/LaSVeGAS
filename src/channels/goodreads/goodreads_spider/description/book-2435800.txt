2435800:::::Julie the Karate Kid:::::Julie Porter can't wait to start karate lessons in gym class even though Charlie Cashman and the other boys say she's too small to be any good. But Julie carefully watches the teacher, Mr. Ogata, and works hard at mastering each karate move. That doesn't stop Charlie from teasing Julie--taunting her to try to karate kick him. But Julie doesn't want to. She knows the best karate students never try to fight. Can she show Charlie and his friends who's tougher--without losing her cool?
