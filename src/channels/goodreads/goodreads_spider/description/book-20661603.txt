20661603:::::Redemption in Love:::::It's love or nothing... All Amandine Monroe ever wanted was to fit in with her glamorous and wealthy in-laws and live happily ever after with her irresistible husband Gavin Lloyd. Three years after the wedding, she's still nowhere near fitting in with her in-laws, and Gavin has given her everything--except his heart. When she finds out she's pregnant, she decides she can't raise her child in a home devoid of love. If she can't have Gavin's heart, only a divorce will do. Gavin won't let the only woman he truly cares for walk away without a fight. He demands full custody of their child or a chance for them to reconcile. Saving their marriage will require more than expensive gifts and a second honeymoon. If Amandine and Gavin can't overcome their pride and private fears, they'll have to let go of each other forever...
