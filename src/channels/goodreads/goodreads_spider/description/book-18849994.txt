18849994:::::Beautifully Broken:::::Jacqueline I m messed up. I could say it was a result of my childhood, but honestly I blame myself. The medicine made me feel numb, the blood made me feel high. He wasn t supposed to be mine, but although he was scared in the beginning, he didn t run from my demons. He found beauty in my flaws, beauty in the cracks that barely held me together. Lee I had it good, any girl of the week, my dream job, stability, and even then, I knew deep down something was missing. Madalynne opened a door for me, Jacqueline lit the flame. She wasn t perfect, far from it, but underneath the pain and the scars, I saw her. Sometimes the ones worth fighting for don t know their worth. Sometimes being broken is beautiful. Beautifully Broken is the fourth book in the Infinite Love series.
