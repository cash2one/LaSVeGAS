Shauzia finally decides to leave the camp and try her luck on the streets. She is determined to earn money to buy her passage out of the country. An incident with a dishonest man lands her in jail, where she spends the night, terrified and despairing, before well-meaning Americans she met when she was begging rescue her. They take her to their home in a residential part of Peshawar, and for a time she has a taste of a life where children have food to eat and warm beds and toys to play with, and she feels safe for the first time. But just when she thinks the family will ask her to stay with them, disaster ensues, and Shauzia finds herself driven back to the refugee camp, where she discovers the old choices are not so easy any more. This is a powerful and very human story of a feisty, driven girl who tries to take control of her own life. A map, glossary and author's note provide young readers with background and context. Royalties from the sale of this book will go to Street Kids International.
