11661298:::::What Do You Do With a Chocolate Jesus?: An Irreverent History of Christianity:::::What Do You Do with a Chocolate Jesus? (An Irreverent History of Christianity) is a funny, skeptical, but genuine exploration of the Christian history they don t teach in Sunday school. It finds humor, irony, and occasional insight amid the inconsistencies, absurdities, and flat out weirdness that too often passes for eternal truth. Pitting actual Scripture against pious propaganda, Thomas Quinn treks through chapter and verse of the New Testament, explores the sordid saga of the medieval Church (including End-of-the-World panics and fights about what kind of stuff Jesus was made of), and reveals some of the shocking attitudes of America s founders toward religion. It isn t always pretty, but it s usually good for a laugh.
