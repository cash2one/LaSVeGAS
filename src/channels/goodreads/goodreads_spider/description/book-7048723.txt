7048723:::::What Kinda Cactus Izzat?:::::Reg Manning is primarily noted for his editorial cartoons, which won him the Pulitzer Prize, and which have been reprinted in hundreds of newspapers throughout America and around the world. Born in Kansas City, MO, in 1905, Reg came to Phoenix, AZ as a boy and has lived with the cacti ever since. He has served on the board of the famous Arizona Desert Botanical Garden for years, but denies that he is a botanical expert. "I can't remember Latin names," he explains. "I know the desert plants as friends, not specimens of Cactaceae." Reg and his wife Ruth (whom he met in high school art class) have one son, Lt. Col. Dave (Arizona Air Guard), who provided them with a daughter-in-law, Peggy, and two grandchildren, Melanie and Mike. If you don't want to talk about cacti, Reg will gladly discuss grandchildren.
