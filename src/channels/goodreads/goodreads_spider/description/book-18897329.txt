18897329:::::The Warrior:::::James is sitting at a Ft. Worth intersection waiting for the light to change when he hears the roar of a truck engine speeding toward him. Before he can react, his motorcycle is crushed, and he is thrown fifty feet onto the median. At that precise moment in Dallas, Elizabeth s sleep is interrupted by a vivid dream in which she witnesses James accident. As she watches him begin to pass from life to death, she extends her hand and cries, Don t die if you don t know Jesus! Although neither James nor Elizabeth is aware of the existence of the other, they begin a ten-year odyssey in which their lives are inexorably intertwined, changing their futures and the futures of those they love most. The Warrior is a moving testimony to the power of prayer and God s desire to redeem every life.
