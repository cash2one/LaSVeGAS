17162950:::::Safe & Sound:::::When Amy Millhouse and her sorority sisters travelled to Mexico for vacation, they never expected what would be waiting for them: sun, sand, and a drug cartel holding the girls ransom for everything they were worth and more. Set against the backdrop of the ongoing drug wars in Mexico, Safe and Sound centers on the story of Amy Millhouse, a twenty-two year old recent college graduate who is struggling to adjust to normalcy after being kidnapped and held for ransom by a violent drug gang. Through conversations and vivid flashbacks, Amy walks her therapist, Dr. Vilsek, through the harrowing two weeks that she and sixteen of her sorority sisters spent held hostage in a basement before their ransom was paid. But when the rest of the girls got to go home, Amy s time in Mexico was just beginning. Safe and Sound is ultimately the story of one woman s journey to Hell and back, and what she learns about herself and the rest of the world along the way. *CAUTION: Book contains language/themes that may be inappropriate for minors.
