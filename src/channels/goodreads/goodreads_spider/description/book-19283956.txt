19283956:::::Chasing Pretty:::::Ashlyn is sick of the attention her beauty brings to the point she may do something rash like smack her face against a cement wall, anything to alter her appearance. As a senior at Mt. Timmons High, the boys date her for the bragging rights and the girls despise her out of jealousy. Even her own mother doesn't try to hide her contempt. Mt. Timmons, Virginia is known for historical battles and colonial witch trials. Since childhood Ashlyn's been taught that this is the place where history is made. But all she wants to do is fade into obscurity when a scantily clad picture of her, that's been photoshopped by her ex, is circulated at school. As if life couldn't get any worse her car breaks down. Zeus, the one man immune to her charms, offers her a ride home, he just has to make one quick stop. But that layover changes everything. There's a witch and a book of spells and Michael, the ideal boyfriend conjured from pure magic. Ashlyn must choose between two men, the real thing or the dream, come to terms with her own appearance and keep her mother in the dark long enough to decide her future. All this while figuring out if the man who's stalking her is really her ex. There's magic swirling through the Virginia hills and it might just save Ashlyn's life...
