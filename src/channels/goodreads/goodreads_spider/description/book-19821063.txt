19821063:::::Dubliners:::::For the centennial of its original publication, an irresistible Graphic Deluxe Edition of one of the most beloved books of the 20th century Perhaps the greatest short story collection in the English language, James Joyce s Dubliners is a vivid and unflinching portrait of dear dirty Dublin at the turn of the twentieth century. These fifteen stories, including such unforgettable ones as Araby, Grace, and The Dead, delve into the heart of the city of Joyce s birth, capturing the cadences of Dubliners speech and portraying with an almost brute realism their outer and inner lives. Dubliners is Joyce at his most accessible and most profound, and this edition is the definitive text, authorized by the Joyce estate and collated from all known proofs, manuscripts, and impressions to reflect the author s original wishes.
