11439:::::All of Us: The Collected Poems:::::This prodigiously rich collection suggests that Raymond Carver was not only America s finest writer of short fiction, but also one of its most large-hearted and affecting poets. Like Carver s stories, the more than 300 poems in All of Us are marked by a keen attention to the physical world; an uncanny ability to compress vast feeling into discreet moments; a voice of conversational intimacy, and an unstinting sympathy. This complete edition brings together all the poems of Carver s five previous books, from Fires to the posthumously published No Heroics, Please . It also contains bibliographical and textual notes on individual poems; a chronology of Carver s life and work; and a moving introduction by Carver s widow, the poet Tess Gallagher.
