26458135:::::Born:::::The world has changed. The buildings have fallen, blown away with the winds. The roads crumble as the forest takes back the land we stole a long time ago. It's only been ten years since the end, but it feels like a hundred for Emma, who has been alone since the beginning, surviving on the skills her crazy father forced on her. Trust no one. Pull the trigger. Hide. Run. Stay away from the other survivors. Stay away from the Infected. She has obeyed her father's rules since she can remember running from the car accident that claimed his life. But one night that all changes. The knock at her cabin door and voice of the girl on the other side don't make Emma help the girl. No-it's the fact that the girl, Anna, is willing to die to save her wounded brother that changes everything in Emma's world. Emma finds friends and family in Anna and her brother Jake. She feels things that she thought she never would. But like her Granny always said, "Everything comes at a cost. You must decide what you are willing to pay." For Emma, that decision comes as Anna is stolen and taken to the breeder farms. Emma knows that she will pay anything to get Anna back, including her own life.
