6465864:::::The Organ Grinders:::::Paul is a committed environmentalist. He`s committed to saving the baboons from his arch-enemy`s experimental farms. Georgette is a committed environmentalist. She`s committed to saving the environment from the scum of the human race. Whatever it takes. And Landis is committed. He`s committed to saving his own ass from a genetic disease. Even if it means experimenting on the baboons Paul wants to save. And he`ll stop at nothing to prevent Paul interfering, including taking out a contract on him. But Georgette and Paul realise they will have to do anything and everything to stop Landis making a monkey out of them. And to save the baboons, guerrilla warefare is only the beginning . . .
