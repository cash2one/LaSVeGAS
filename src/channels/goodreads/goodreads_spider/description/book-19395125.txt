19395125:::::The Vanishing Girl:::::Every night after Ember Pierce falls asleep, she disappears. She can teleport anywhere in the world London, Paris, her crush s bedroom wherever her dreams lead her. Ten minutes is all she gets, and once time s up, she returns to her bed. It's a secret she s successfully kept for the last five years. But now someone knows. A week after her eighteenth birthday, when frustratingly handsome Caden Hawthorne captures her, delivers her to the government, and then disappears before her eyes, Ember realizes two things: One, she is not alone. And two, people like her teleporters are being used as weapons. Dragged off to a remote facility where others like her live, Ember s forced to pair up with her former captor, Caden, to learn how to survive inside until she can escape. Only Caden s making escape seem less and less appealing. But even as Ember falls for the boy who got her into this mess, she knows that she is running out of time. Because the government has plans for those like her, and those plans might just cost Ember her life.
