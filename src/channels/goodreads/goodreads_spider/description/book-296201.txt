296201:::::India Unbound: The Social and Economic Revolution from Independence to the Global Information Age:::::India today is a vibrant free-market democracy, a nation well on its way to overcoming decades of widespread poverty. The nation s rise is one of the great international stories of the late twentieth century, and in India Unbound the acclaimed columnist Gurcharan Das offers a sweeping economic history of India from independence to the new millennium. Das shows how India s policies after 1947 condemned the nation to a hobbled economy until 1991, when the government instituted sweeping reforms that paved the way for extraordinary growth. Das traces these developments and tells the stories of the major players from Nehru through today. As the former CEO of Proctor &amp; Gamble India, Das offers a unique insider s perspective and he deftly interweaves memoir with history, creating a book that is at once vigorously analytical and vividly written. Impassioned, erudite, and eminently readable, India Unbound is a must for anyone interested in the global economy and its future. Editorial Reviews The advent of the digital age, coupled with the liberalization of the Indian economy, has inaugurated what Gurcharan Das -- novelist, playwright, and former CEO of Procter &amp; Gamble India -- calls a "silent revolution" in the heart of the world's most populous democracy. In his latest book, an impassioned and eloquent blending of history, autobiography, and economic analysis, Das argues that within a generation, 50 percent of India's population, which itself accounts for one-sixth of all the world's people, will become members of the middle class. The implications of this statement for the nation and for the global marketplace are staggering. As Das says, "In information technology we may finally have found the engine that can drive India's takeoff and transform our country."
