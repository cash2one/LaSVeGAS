There s intrigue to spare as she digs into the origin of the demonic lords and discovers the machinations of humans and demons alike.

But treachery runs rampant among all the lords, and she s going to have to stay sharp in order to keep from being used to further their own agendas. The lords have a secret that dates back to earth s ancient history, and it could have devastating repercussions for both worlds.
