5704478:::::My Soul to Take:::::Top notch crime fiction. Boston Globe American readers first met Icelandic lawyer and investigator Th ra Gudmundsd ttir in Last Rituals. In My Soul to Take, internationally acclaimed author Yrsa Sigurdard ttir plunges her intrepid heroine into even graver peril, in a riveting thriller set against the harsh landscape of Smila s Sense of Snow territory. A darkly witty and continually surprising suspense tale that places Yrsa Sigurdard ttir firmly in the ranks of Sue Grafton, Tess Gerritsen, Faye Kellerman and other top mystery writers, My Soul to Take is ingenious Scandinavian noir on a par with the works of Henning Mankell and Arnaldur Indridason. Stieg Larsson ( The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo ) fans should also take note.
