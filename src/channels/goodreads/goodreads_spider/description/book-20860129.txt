20860129:::::The Lonely Ones:::::Fain hasn t always been lonely. Her family used to be close; she used to have good friends. But as circumstances and people changed, Fain was left behind. That's when the monsters appeared. While her parents argue and her peers and siblings either pick on or simply ignore her, Fain spends time in a world of her own making. During the day, she crafts stories of fantastical adventures, but in the darkness of night, these adventures come to life alongside a legion of imaginary creatures, with Fain as their queen. In time, Fain begins to see possibilities and friendships emerge in her day-to-day, but when she is let down by the one relationship she thought she could trust, Fain must decide: remain queen of the imaginary creatures, or risk opening herself up to the fragile connections that can only be formed in the real world? Told in lyrical free verse, The Lonely Ones reminds us of the need for imaginative play and the power of true friendship.
