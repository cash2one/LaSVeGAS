127446:::::Kathleen's Story:::::It's the summer after sophomore year and Raina has convinced her best friends since the sixth grade, Kathleen and Holly, to spend their summer as "pink angels" in Parker-Sloan General Hospital's summer volunteer program. Kathleen is reluctant to do it - she has enough responsibility at home caring for her sick mother. But when she meets Carson, a cute and flirty fellow volunteer, she is happy that she joined the program. Or, at least, she thinks she is. Carson's "old friend" Stephanie keeps showing up at all the wrong times. And Kathleen's mother keeps complaining that she needs Kathleen at home. But with friends Raina and Holly by her side and her Pink Angel t-shirt on her back, Kathleen is able to realize that helping others also allows you to help yourself.
