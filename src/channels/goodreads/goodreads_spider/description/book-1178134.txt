But Jasmine, the sultry Prowler who barely survived her run-in with them in Boston, has begun to build a new pack in New York. When Bill probes the Prowler underground, he finds old friends, secret alliances, and betrayal, and his predicament draws Courtney away from Boston on a quest to make sure the man she loves gets home safely. To the north, Jack and Molly uncover the truth -- that the pack has grown larger than they could ever have realized. With Prowlers all around them, they must reach out to all of their allies, dead or alive, if they are to save Bill and Courtney and survive the final conflict with Jasmine.
