4216729:::::Akiko and the Missing Misp:::::AKIKO NEVER KNOWS when her next adventure will zoom her away to another galaxy. And when she's visited by the Akiko replacement robot in the middle of the first annual Middleton Mega MangaFest, she's more than eager to visit her friends on planet Smoo. But when Akiko lands on Smoo, it's different. And so are her friends. King Froptoppit's castle is smaller, no one has any idea who she is, and Mr. Beeba has--no way!--a full head of hair. Akiko got to planet Smoo all right--but it's planet Smoo 25 years ago. And now that Akiko is part of Smoovian history, she might just change it. For the worse!
