35917300:::::This is the Way the World Ends: An Oral History of the Zombie War:::::This is an alternate cover edition of ASIN B074JXHFYK . February, 2031 : The global population now stands at an estimated 400 million, and every survivor bears the scars of humanity's struggle to defeat an enemy few believed could exist. Some nations have emerged stronger than ever. Others still struggle to survive. Some no longer exist at all. In the aftermath of the zombie pandemic Keith Taylor, noted author of post apocalyptic fiction, traveled the world to gather the first hand accounts of survivors from every walk of life, culture and strata of society, ranging from American political leaders to British journalists to members of India's homeless underclass. These chilling interviews describe the course of humanity's most brutal war, leading from the initial emergence of the virus in the Siberian wilderness to the visceral, heart-rending Shibuya footage, through the confusion of the US President's impeachment to the unintended and disastrous consequences of the UN's sweeping refugee amendment, and ending with us battered and broken, diminished but not defeated, in the fragile peace we now enjoy. Together these accounts represent the most illuminating and complete commentary to date of humanity's loss. From these candid interviews emerges an image of early 21st century civilization as it truly was: imperfect, fragmented and wholly unprepared for a disaster on such a scale. This is the Way the World Ends takes an unflinching, uncompromising look at the world we had and lost; a look at the pain we suffered due to our inability to accept a single, simple truth: Zombies are real. Note : Readers who lived through the pandemic may find the interviews contained within this collection distressing. Discretion is advised.
