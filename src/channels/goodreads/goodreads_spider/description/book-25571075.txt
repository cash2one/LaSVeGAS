25571075:::::Determinational:::::Did you know a girl with a broken neck could still walk a half marathon, and even win a triathlon relay? Becoming partially paralyzed after a devastating unlicensed-motorized-vehicle vs. bicycle crash, Monique tells of her struggle to regain everything she lost, and more. Completing the New Orleans Rock'n'Roll Half Marathon just a few months after her release from the hospital, her determination and love for life has gained fame and influenced millions. She continues to move ever onward, and tells her story of adaptability and resourcefulness with insight and inner dialogue reflecting on how and why she s so driven. Monique s brutally honest view of life is counterpointed by sarcasm and attempts at humor, and she likes to write about herself in the third person. Like right now.
