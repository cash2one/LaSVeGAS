9514033:::::Exposure:::::In Exposure , award-winning writer Alan Russell delivers an intricate, ambitious thriller that unfolds at break-neck speed against a glamorous and absorbing background. England's most beloved philanthropist and her football-star lover die in a crash caused by a mystery car. A papparazzo-Graham Wells, the driver of that mystery car-would do anything to keep his terrible secret from getting out. So when a CIA operative blackmails him into engineering the scandalous downfalls of several high-profile celebrities, he has no choice. Nothing he's done is illegal-and his targets are certainly guilty of the acts he's caught on film-but he doesn't understand the purpose of his actions and the whole arrangement leaves a bad taste in his mouth. Then Graham, desperately trapped in the hidden motives of the CIA, stops a superstar actress who thought she was alone from committing suicide. Lanie Byrne, the beloved Miss L, is perhaps Hollywood's biggest celebrity, and although Graham is feeling desperate himself, he has trouble imagining what could possibly cause this beautiful actress to want to die. This charitable act ignites a chain-reaction of political intrigue and personal danger from which there might be no escape.
