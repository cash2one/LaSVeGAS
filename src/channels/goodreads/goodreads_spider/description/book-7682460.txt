7682460:::::Be Not Content:::::Be Not Content is a coming-of-age novel set in San Jose, California, in the mid 1960s describing William Craddock s experiences as a young acidhead. This is a hip, profound, and wonderfully-written book, a unique chronicle of the earliest days of the great psychedelic upheaval. Be Not Content is filled with warmth and empathy, tragic at times, and very funny in spots, a wastrel masterpiece where laughter plays counterpoint against the oboes of doom. A mystical underground masterpiece that s been virtually unobtainable for years. Brought back to life by Transreal Books via an agreement with Craddock s estate.
