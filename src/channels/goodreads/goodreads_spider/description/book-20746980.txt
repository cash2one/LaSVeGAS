20746980:::::Salvation:::::You get to the point where you can just say it. There was never anything special about me, except my father is rich and important. That's why it happened. It was just a normal Tuesday afternoon. I was twenty-three and thinking about my new designer boots. They kidnapped me for ransom. They raped me before I was rescued. My therapist says that talking about it means I'm starting to heal. I don't really think I am. It's even harder to talk about Gideon. He couldn t save me when it really mattered, so he keeps trying to save me now. He refuses to give up on me, and I can t make him understand. There are some things you just can t be saved from. Salvation is a love story that follows a difficult path of healing after sexual assault. It is a true romance, but it addresses very hard issues, including rape and attempted suicide. The novel is not, however, about captivity and violence. It is about love, healing, and hope.
