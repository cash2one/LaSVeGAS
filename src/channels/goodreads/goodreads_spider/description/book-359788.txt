But even if he is found not guilty, he has gained an enemy for life--the dead boy's vindictive father. Twelve years later, Obi-Wan is a Jedi Knight, with his own young apprentice, Anakin Skywalker. Anakin doesn't know about the secrets Obi-Wan is hiding. But as the past comes back to attack them, Obi-Wan and Anakin must fight deception with truth--and face off against enemies both new and old.
