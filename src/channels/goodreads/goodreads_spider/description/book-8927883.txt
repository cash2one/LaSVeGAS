8927883:::::Shiva To Shankara: Decoding The Phallic Symbol:::::Many modern scholars say Shiva s linga is a phallic symbol. Most devotees disagree. Who is right? This book looks at the sexual metaphors associated with Shiva and uncovers the meaning beneath.In the process we discover how the symbol of Shiva is reflected in the story of Shiva s marriage. The question is: Why does the Goddess transform Shiva, the hermit, into Shankara, the householder? Is the story and symbol about divinity or about us? This book is the first of its kind to show the uncanny alignment between metaphysics, rituals, symbols and stories of Shiva. Beyond the phallus is a secret idea that enriches the soul, says the author.
