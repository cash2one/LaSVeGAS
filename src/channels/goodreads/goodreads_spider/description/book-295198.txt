295198:::::Slaves of the Mastery:::::'Slaves of the Mastery' is the fantastically vivid, breathtaking sequel to 'The Wind Singer' by William Nicholson. Written with the same passion and cinematic scope as the first book in the series, 'Slaves of the Mastery' picks up the story of siblings Kestrel and Bowman five years on from the closing chapter of 'The Wind Singer'. The city of Aramanth has become a kinder place, but in becoming kinder it has also become weaker, making it the perfect target for the ruthless soldiers of the Mastery. After a swift and brutal battle that leaves the city burned and the Manth people destined for slavery, Kestrel finds herself alone, angry and bitterly sworn to wreak her own revenge. But first she must find her beloved brother Bowman, and he in turn must find a way of understanding the secrets of the mysterious Singer people. Only then can the pair begin to strike out against the Mastery and begin a voyage that will bring the Manth people back to their former stature. 'Slaves of the Mastery' lives up to all the promises made by 'The Wind Singer', and readers who enjoyed the first book will certainly be thrilled by the pace and execution of the second. Dramatic, complex and thought-provoking, this is a challenging read for readers aged 10 and over. - Susan Harrison
