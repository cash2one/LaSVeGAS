18078354:::::And the Mountains Echoed:::::And the Mountains Echoed is a deeply moving new novel about how we love, how we take care of one another and how the choices we make resonate through history. A multi-generational family story revolving around brothers and sisters, it explores the ways in which they love, wound, betray, honour and sacrifice for each other. With profound wisdom, depth, insight and compassion - and moving from Kabul, to Paris, to San Francisco, to the Greek island of Tinos - Hosseini writes about the bonds that define us and shape our lives, the ways that we help our loved ones in need and how we are often surprised by the people closest to us.
