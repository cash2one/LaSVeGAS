10454282:::::Sons of the Great Satan:::::When American teenager Joey Andrews and his family arrive in Tehran, Iran in 1976 they find an expatriate paradise within one of the world's oldest civilizations. Through the bold and imperious leadership of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, this ancient land is thrust into the modern age bringing great progress to some and seething resentment to others. It is the twilight of an empire, the last golden hours before the fall of darkness. SONS OF THE GREAT SATAN leads the reader through a cataclysmic event as seen through the lives of the Andrews family of Peligrosa, Texas and the Zadehs of Tehran, Iran. Joey Andrews and Farhad Zadeh form a friendship amid a naive wonderland of teenage sex, drugs and rock'n'roll that explodes into a firestorm that rocks a nation. As a work of historical fiction, SONS OF THE GREAT SATAN is a tale of culture clash, international politics, heroism, friendship, cowardice and sinister betrayal. The character and beliefs of the Shah of Iran, President Jimmy Carter and the Ayatollah Khomeini are all put to the test as the whirlwind of chaos engulfs them all. The actions of these powerful men play out on the world stage and forever change the lives of those who called Tehran home in the late 1970s. The paths of Iran and America have been intricately bound by blood and violence for many decades. What happened between these two nations continues to reverberate today. SONS OF THE GREAT SATAN is based on the author's impressions as a teenager living in Iran prior to the Islamic revolution. All of the characters, organizations and events portrayed in this work are either products of the author's imagination or are used fictionally.
