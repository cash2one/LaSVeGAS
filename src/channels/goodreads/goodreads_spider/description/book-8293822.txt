8293822:::::Alice 19th, Volume 2:::::In this volume, Lotis Master Frei explains the power of the Lotis words to Alice. That's fine, she thinks - but when he decides he wants to marry her, much to her chagrin - he tries to seal the deal with a kiss, and Alice is ready to fight. Rabbit-girl Nyozeka sees that Kyou has the potential to become a Lotis Master himself, if only he would realize it. Meanwhile, Frei and Alice must enter the "inner heart" of her mother to eradicate the evil therein. Complicating matters even more, Mayura has been swallowed by a very powerful demon, and Alice is not at all sure that her magic bracelet or the magic words will help her save her sister.
