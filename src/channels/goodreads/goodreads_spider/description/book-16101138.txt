After all, she s baby Mia, the one who fell down a well. That was years ago, though the darkness still haunts her.

Their deaths are gruesome and Mia worries she and her friends may be next. In order to survive, Mia and her small crew must break quarantine and outrun armed soldiers in hazmat suits who shoot first and ask questions later. And there s only one place to go the Cave, aka Fenton Electronics. Mia knows it s somehow connected and hopes her dad, Director of Fenton Electronics, who has always been strangely secretive about his work, has the answers she needs, and more importantly a cure to save everyone before the whole town succumbs to the mysterious virus. Unfortunately, it s not answers Mia discovers, but something far more treacherous and impossible than even the virus itself. A high-stakes, fast-paced adventure with imagination and heart.
