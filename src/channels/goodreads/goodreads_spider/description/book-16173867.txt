16173867:::::Mortal:::::It is one of the world s great ironies, that mortals spend their lives worrying about their immortal souls while immortals spend their eternity worrying about their mortals. Emma wanted a normal life, her father more than anything wanted it for her. Of course life seldom turns out the way you want. Especially when a mentally deranged shade is trying to steal your very blood for his own demonic purposes. Throw in some feelings for a pair of vampires old enough to be your great-great-great grandfathers and it makes for one messed up mortal life.
