3407354:::::Let Them Eat Fruitcake:::::It's the holiday season, and each of the roommates at 86 Bloomberg Place is a little blue . Megan's got the boss from hell, and now her mom is going on a cruise, leaving Megan alone for Christmas for the first time ever. Lelani can't afford to fly home to Hawaii and isn't sure she'd be welcomed anyway, not that she can admit that to anyone. Anna's old boyfriend the one who cheated on her has sailed back into her life, just when she's met a for-real "nice guy" she's been keeping secret from her large, crazy Latino family. And Kendall's met a famous actor, who might be the answer to her money woes if she could only convince him she's the love of his life. His wife might have something to say about that, though. Thank goodness God's around to listen when the girls need help! Let's face it, relationships are hard work whether they're with family and friends, coworkers and customers, or boyfriends and girlfriends. And when you've got your first apartment, a real job, and grown-up responsibilities, too, relationships are loaded with confusion, emotion, and secrets you can't tell to anyone but God. Best-selling author Melody Carlson has captured all the uncertainty and joy of being twenty-something in pitch-perfect detail and their stories just might sound like someone you know.
