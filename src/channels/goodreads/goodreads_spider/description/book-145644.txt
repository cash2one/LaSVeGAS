145644:::::Humility: True Greatness:::::Be Transformed by Christ s Example God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble. 1 Peter 5:5 A battle rages within every one of us every day. It s the clash between our sense of stubborn self-sufficiency and God s call to recognize that we re really nothing without Him. It s pride versus humility. And it s a fight we can t win without looking repeatedly to Christ and the cross. C. J. Mahaney raises a battle cry to daily, diligently, and deliberately weaken our greatest enemy (pride) and cultivate our greatest friend (humility). His examination clarifies misconceptions, revealing the truth about why God detests pride and turns His active attention to the humble. Because pride is never passive, defeating it demands an intentional attack. The blessing that follows is God s abundant favor. This is the one to whom I will look: he who is humble and contrite in spirit. Isaiah 66:2, ESV God clearly states that He is drawn to the humble. He s also clear that He opposes the proud. These two, humility and pride, cannot coexist. Where one is fostered, the other is defeated. Which will you pursue?
