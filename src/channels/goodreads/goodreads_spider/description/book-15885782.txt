15885782:::::On The Intuitive Spectrum: A Deeper Look into the Amazing Value of Intuition:::::The sun god Apollo sentenced Cassandra to be able to prophesy her intuitions but to never be believed. Since ancient times, the gift of prophecy and intuition was a present that was bestowed upon Cassandra by Apollo. Apollo loved Cassandra, and she rejected Apollo s advances toward her. Hence, because she rejected Apollo, this curse is still, in effect, today. Even in the modern-day world intuition is rarely believed or trusted because there is no proof or guarantee. Only after the intuition was seen to be correct do you say, Oh, if only I had listened to my intuition. Susan invites you to explore the depth of intuition with her and discover its worth to you. Perhaps, reminding you that you always wondered about your own intuition but brushed it away and might now reclaim it as a useful tool. A variety of readers will be interested in this book, including therapists, their patients, students of psychology, Jungian scholars, and people of all ages. This book is an exploration and an invitation to everyone to begin to discern and explore within themselves their own subtle intuitive sense perceptions as a cultural value and a personal transformative power.
