3020046:::::We, the Accused:::::Ernest Raymond was not generally regarded as a crime novelist, and 'We The Accused' is not a puzzle story of the traditional kind, but a realistic novel based on the Crippen case. Paul Presset, a nondescript schoolmaster, cannot resist an open opportunity to rid himself of his overbearing, nagging wife. This powerful and haunting novel traces the dawn of motive in his mind through the murder and resulting manhunt, arrest, trial, and a final, terrible culminating scene.
