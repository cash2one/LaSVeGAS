13424671:::::Soy Sauce Face:::::Sometimes the best kept secret is the one you keep from yourself I m an ordinary man with an ordinary life in every way. Except for Jun. That s what I think to myself every night when I watch Jun getting ready for his work as a bar host in Kabukicho. He s everything I m not. He s the beautiful, graceful, sociable and ambitious counterpart to me a hulking, reclusive, completely unambitious guy who d rather fix car and motorcycle engines all day than interact with people I d be happy if Jun just stayed here with me the rest of our lives, in this little apartment we d once shared with Dad. But Jun has other plans. Or so Jun thinks. One night he gets ready and goes to work. But a tragic occurrence derails his career and all his plans for the future. Through the eyes of his best friend, Tomo, the man who loves him above all others, Jun will be forced to confront himself, his deepest fears, hates, desires. And his deepest love.
