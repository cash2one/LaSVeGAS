32509878:::::Break Me:::::You can t help who you fall for. Katy Vanderlin has a problem. A man who won t leave her alone. Until he proposes to her in front of her company as a joke. Wanting to make partner at her consulting firm, she sees an opportunity arise. Hire the man to be her fake fiance until after the holidays. Extravagant parties, company get-together's and it should be a shoo-in for her. One problem, Pollux Clark. Pollux is hired to be her fake fiance if he can not mess it up, she might possibly become partner. If he can just keep his past hidden well, and his reasoning for being near her contained he may just make the pay out of his lifetime. But for these two the fun is only beginning. Until one of them breaks. Who will be first?
