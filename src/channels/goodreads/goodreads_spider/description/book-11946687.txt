11946687:::::The Demon Lover:::::I gasped, or tried to. My mouth opened, but I couldn t draw breath. His lips, pearly wet, parted and he blew into my mouth. My lungs expanded beneath his weight. When I exhaled he sucked my breath in and his weight turned from cold marble into warm living flesh. Since accepting a teaching position at remote Fairwick College in upstate New York, Callie McFay has experienced the same disturbingly sensual dream every night: A mist enters her bedroom, then takes the shape of a virile, seductive stranger who proceeds to ravish her in the most toe-curling, wholly satisfying ways possible. Perhaps these dreams are the result of her having written the bestselling book The Sex Lives of Demon Lovers . Callie s lifelong passion is the intersection of lurid fairy tales and Gothic literature which is why she s found herself at Fairwick s renowned folklore department, living in a once-stately Victorian house that, at first sight, seemed to call her name. But Callie soon realizes that her dreams are alarmingly real. She has a demon lover an incubus and he will seduce her, pleasure her, and eventually suck the very life from her. Then Callie makes another startling discovery: Her incubus is not the only mythical creature in Fairwick. As the tenured witches of the college and the resident fairies in the surrounding woods prepare to cast out the demon, Callie must accomplish something infinitely more difficult banishing this supernatural lover from her heart. Vivid and enchanting . . . Dark s letter-perfect gothic style is a satisfying tribute to previous gothic novels, and the paranormal elements, including incubi, fae, vampires, and witches, make this a stellar romance. Booklist (Top 10 SF/Fantasy) [Juliet] Dark develops a complex, detailed world where magic, reason, and gothic literature enjoyably intersect. Publishers Weekly From the Trade Paperback edition.
