2074330:::::Confessions of a Serial Kisser:::::EVANGELINE LOGAN WANTS a kiss. A spectacular, heart-stopping, life changing kiss. Somehow The Crimson Kiss (a romance novel she s become obsessed with) and Four Steps to Living Your Fantasy (a self-help book she s reading) have fused in Evangeline s mind and sent her on a quest for a kiss. But the path to perfection is paved with many bad kisses the smash mouth, the ear licker, the misser. The phrase I don t kiss and tell means nothing to the boys in her school. And worse: someone starts writing her name and number on bathroom walls. And worst of all: the boy she's just kissed turns out to be her best friend s new crush. Kissing turns out to be way more complicated than the romance novels would have you believe . . . From the Hardcover edition.
