Her mother is in a nursing home, suffering from Alzheimer's disease. In the ensuing months, unsettling events threaten Davida s safety, sobriety, and sanity. Foremost among these is the reappearance of her high school sweetheart, Paul, who had traumatized Davida as a teenager by playing an inexplicably cruel practical joke. Events suggest that he may be stalking her, but she is starting to question her own perceptions. Despite increasing self-doubt, she continues to work, via long distance phone calls, with three of her Oakland therapy clients: a Korean college student whose burden of responsibility toward his immigrant parents has led him to attempt suicide; a stoic, workaholic man anguished by being his family s scapegoat; and a woman coping with the family havoc wreaked by her husband s bipolar illness. Interwoven with the main plot of the novel, their stories resonate with Davida s struggle against mental deterioration and her quest to solve the central mystery of her life.
