17332968:::::Reality Boy:::::Gerald Faust knows exactly when he started feeling angry: the day his mother invited a reality television crew into his five-year-old life. Twelve years later, he s still haunted by his rage-filled youth which the entire world got to watch from every imaginable angle and his anger issues have resulted in violent outbursts, zero friends, and clueless adults dumping him in the special education room at school. Nothing is ever going to change. No one cares that he s tried to learn to control himself, and the girl he likes has no idea who he really is. Everyone s just waiting for him to snap and he s starting to feel dangerously close to doing just that. In this fearless portrayal of a boy on the edge, highly acclaimed Printz Honor author A.S. King explores the desperate reality of a former child star who finally breaks free of his anger by creating possibilities he never knew he deserved.
