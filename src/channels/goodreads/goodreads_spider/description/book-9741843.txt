9741843:::::Tempting the Highlander:::::Of the seven bold brothers born to defend their Scottish Highlands, Crevan McTiernay is the most restrained. But that doesn't make him any less passionate... It begins as a ploy... When Raelynd Schellden and her sister are caught in the stables with the notorious McTiernay twins, her father sees not scandal, but opportunity. The future of his clan is uncertain, and a double engagement even under false pretenses will lend security to his people and protect his beloved daughters from power-mad fools. And becomes a pleasure... But Raelynd's designated intended interests her far less than his quietly powerful brother, Crevan, a man born to lead. Though bound by honor and committed to his sworn duty, Crevan cannot resist a taste of Raelynd's crimson lips when offered and then another and another until the unlikely couple is entangled in both a public deception and each other's hearts.
