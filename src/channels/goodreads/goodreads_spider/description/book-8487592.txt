8487592:::::Here to Stay:::::CATHERINE ANDERSON WILL TOUCH YOUR EMOTIONS WITH THE NEXT CONTEMPORARY STORY IN HER HARRIGAN FAMILY SERIES. Mandy Pajeck had a tough childhood --- an abusive father, a mother who left, and a younger brother, Luke, who depended on her when she was just a child herself. Now twenty-eight, Mandy remains devoted to Luke and feels responsible for the accident that took his sight. But his complete reliance on her care is making them both miserable. When she meets handsome Zach Harrigan and his mini guide horse, she thinks she's found the ticket to her brother's happiness --- and maybe her own. Of the five Harrigan siblings, Zach is the hellion who parties hard and takes nothing seriously. But lately his life has felt empty. So, employing his skills as a horseman, he begins training a mini guide horse for the blind, never expecting that the project will lead him to beautiful, tenderhearted Mandy. She's everything he's ever wanted in a woman. But though she's charmed by Zach's patience and compassion, she can't bring herself to fully trust him. And when Zach urges her to confront the truth about her mother's disappearance, the secrets they uncover are so shocking that even Zach's steadfast devotion may not be enough to win Mandy's heart.
