35714190:::::Raincheck:::::Ty Benson is tall, dark, delicious and done with women. As the singer for the iconic rock band Raincheck, Ty is sick of women chasing after him. He s sworn off relationships, enjoying the simplicity that celibacy brings. Until he meets Liv Madison. She s completely and maddeningly - uninterested in him. And it s seriously turning him on. Stuck together on Raincheck s Summer Tour, Ty is trying to stay away from her. But it s getting harder every day. Liv Madison just wants to work on her Master s thesis and have some fun this summer. Which is the exact reason she s tagging along as her best friend Gabe performs on Raincheck s tour. Ty Benson, however, seems to have other plans for her. As annoying as he is gorgeous, Ty just won t leave her alone. And it s affecting her relationship with Gabe - in a completely unexpected way. Can Ty convince Liv to give him a chance? Or will her friendship with Gabe turn into so much more?
