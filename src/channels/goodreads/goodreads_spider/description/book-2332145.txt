2332145:::::Eve of Darkness:::::Cursed by God, hunted by demons, desired by Cain and Abel... All in a day's work. For Evangeline Hollis, a long ago fling with a bad boy from the wrong side of the tracks just became a disaster of biblical proportions. One night with a leather-clad man of mystery has led to a divine punishment: the Mark of Cain. Thrust into a world where sinners are drafted into service to kill demons, Eve s learning curve is short. A longtime agnostic, she begrudgingly maneuvers through a celestial bureaucracy where she is a valuable but ill-treated pawn. She s also become the latest point of contention in the oldest case of sibling rivalry in history... But she ll worry about all that later. Right now she s more concerned with learning to kill while staying alive. And saving the soul she d never believed she had.
