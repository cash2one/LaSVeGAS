3225253:::::Akiko and the Journey to Toog:::::Poog s in trouble. Just three simple words, but they re enough to launch fifth-grade Akiko and the rest of her crew Spuckler Boach, Mr. Beeba, and Gax on their next mission. And it just might be their most important mission yet: To save the planet Toog, home of their good friend Poog. Someone s out to destroy Toog, and only Akiko and the gang can stop them. But first they have to escape from a Toogolian jail cell, zoom through a barrage of exploding drobe mines, and enlist the help of Spuckler s old friend Fluggly Ragstubble who s anything but helpful. The clock is ticking and every second counts. Will they win the race against time and save Poog s home planet?
