18047607:::::Spiral:::::Nessa Cavanaugh, psychology student, knows how to stay on an even keel. Despite the urging of her mother and her academic advisor to get a life and have some fun, all work and no play sums up her plan to survive her grueling internship year at a children's hospital. She doesn't want to end up like her father, whose constant ups and downs broke her family, and avoiding unnecessary emotional entanglements is a must. Then she (literally) runs into Dr. Aron Lindstrom in the middle of her disastrous first day on the job. The attraction is instant and terrifying. Nessa knows she should stay away especially when she finds out he has a reputation for being a player but Aron is brilliant, intense, and as sexy as they come. When he challenges her to take a chance on him, her plans to stay focused on work start to crumble. But what begins as passion takes on a dangerous edge, becoming an emotional roller coaster that s frighteningly familiar. As things spiral out of control, Nessa must decide whether she should hold on for the ride or run even if it means leaving her heart behind.
