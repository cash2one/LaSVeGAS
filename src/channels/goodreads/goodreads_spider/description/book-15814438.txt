"An absorbing story that explores both the rewards and perils of love, pride, and sanity." Publishers Weekly "With Blue Asylum , Hepinstall presents the reader with the rare and delicious quandary of whether to race through and find out what happens to her characters or to linger over her vivid, beautifully crafted sentences.
