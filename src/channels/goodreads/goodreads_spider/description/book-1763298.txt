1763298:::::Prince of Spies:::::Prince Nico is a cunning master of stealth, but can he master a maiden's fragile heart? Fourth book in the Dragon Knights series, but can be read on its own. Prince Nico is known as the Prince of Spies for a reason. Not only is he the Spymaster of Draconia, but he's a cunning shapeshifter able to take the form of a dragon at will. The gift of his royal heritage comes in handy as Spymaster for the king, but it's a great secret known only to a few. Riki lives in misery, chained up to serve a mad king's perverted magic. Forced to use her draining healing skills to keep King Lucan of Skithdron alive, Riki is a shadow of the woman she should be. Nico knows Riki is the woman he's been searching for and wastes no time breaking them both out of the enemy palace. Thus starts an adventure that will take them across two countries, through peril and danger, and the discovery of an undeniable love and mutual respect. Will Nico have the courage to let her fly free, trusting she'll return to him, or will his love smother the fledgling beauty who is breathing free air for the first time in her tragic life? Warning, this title contains explicit sex explained in graphic terms and scenes of menage a trois.
