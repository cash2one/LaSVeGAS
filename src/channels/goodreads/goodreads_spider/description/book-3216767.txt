3216767:::::Dangerous Grounds:::::Something's hot in Seattle, and it's not just the espresso. The Seattle Steam series. Madison's needs are simple. All she wants are two things: Make Ooo La Latte the newest trend in espresso, and seduce the sexiest cop in Seattle. But things aren't going exactly as planned. First, Gabe's a little hung up on the fact that she's his best friends little sister, and he's determined to keep his hands off. Second, her shop gets robbed by the increasingly violent Espresso Bandit, and now she's the only one who can identify him. Gabe whisks her into hiding for her own protection, but soon finds his heart is under assault by the luscious and persistent Madison. But no matter where they hide, danger follows. On such dangerous grounds, the trick will be to live long enough to keep the flame alive.
