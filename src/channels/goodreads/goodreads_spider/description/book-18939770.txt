18939770:::::Race for the Cure:::::Dean and Nick will stop at nothing to save their sister, Val, who was bitten by a zombie. When their helicopter crashes into the middle of Zombie Land, the three siblings must fight to survive. Things suddenly get more complicated when a drifter steals the precious vials needed to save Val. The hunt is on to find the scoundrel and get their vials back. IMPORTANT NOTE: This is a warning to those readers who are looking for a more violent read with gruesome descriptions of blood and gore. This is NOT that type of book. There is lots of zombie action, but this particular story is based more on the action, drama, and survival aspects.
