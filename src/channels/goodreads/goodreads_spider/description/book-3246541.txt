3246541:::::At the Center of Destiny:::::Meaghan is an average woman of the times, a housewife, and a mother of two young daughters-until the alien invasion, that is. Now, Meaghan is in hiding, deep in the mountains of Pennsylvania. She struggles fiercely to raise her girls on her own. When Meaghan's daughters are kidnapped by the aliens, she does what any good mother would do and puts her life on the line to save them. Aboard the enemy ship, Meaghan is forced to cooperate with the commander. The aliens want something from Meaghan. She promises herself that she will never feel love again, but the warrior K-naal sneaks past all her defenses. Is K-naal playing with her heart to reach his own goals? What is left of the American government believes Meaghan to be a traitor, sending their elite assassins after her. This enrages the aliens, and now Meaghan must choose between her own people and their enemy.
