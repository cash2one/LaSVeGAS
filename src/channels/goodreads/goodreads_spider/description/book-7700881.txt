7700881:::::No Hope for Gomez!:::::Forewords Book of the Year Kirkus Indie Best Lister IBA and USA Book News finalist It's the age-old tale: Boy meets girl. Boy stalks girl. Girl already has a stalker. Boy becomes her stalker-stalker. We've seen it all before, many times, but this time it's different. If only slightly. Gomez is eternally bewildered by the ease with which others navigate the world. He s never had much luck with women, or jobs, or anything really. Even gravity seems to pull on him a little harder than it does on others. But when he enters a medical trial and a super sexy research assistant falls for him, he thinks his luck has changed even if that assistant has trouble expressing herself in terms outside the realm of science. But when one of the trial participants turns up dead and another goes missing, Gomez begins to fear for his life. No longer sure whom he can trust and which of his experiences are actually real and which merely drug induced delusions, he decides to go underground and work out a devious plan. "Extremely witty and clever writing that contains keen insights into human nature." --California Chronicle "Challenges the way we think about, and interact with, the world around us." --Kirkus Discoveries "The antics in this book will leave the reader laughing. Graham Parke is a genius." --Readers Favorite "A quick and unputdownable read that flies in the face of reason, and smashes against the wall of detective novels. It's a Coens Brothers' film formatted in book form." --Book Review
