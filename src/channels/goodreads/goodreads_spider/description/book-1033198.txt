1033198:::::Villette:::::With her final novel, Villette , Charlotte Bront reached the height of her artistic power. First published in 1853, Villette is Bront 's most accomplished and deeply felt work, eclipsing even Jane Eyre in critical acclaim. Her narrator, the autobiographical Lucy Snowe, flees England and a tragic past to become an instructor in a French boarding school in the town of Villette. There she unexpectedly confronts her feelings of love and longing as she witnesses the fitful romance between Dr. John, a handsome young Englishman, and Ginerva Fanshawe, a beautiful coquette. This first pain brings others, and with them comes the heartache Lucy has tried so long to escape. Yet in spite of adversity and disappointment, Lucy Snowe survives to recount the unstinting vision of a turbulent life's journey a journey that is one of the most insightful fictional studies of a woman's consciousness in English literature. "For the woman writing Villette - both the narrator, Lucy Snowe, and the actual author, Charlotte Bront - imagination is finally victorious over human justice, and Villette , record of pain and defeat that it is, is also Lucy Snowe's own festival of bas coeur , the buried heart." From the Introduction by Susan Fromberg Schaeffer
