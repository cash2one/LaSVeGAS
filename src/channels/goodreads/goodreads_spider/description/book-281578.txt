281578:::::Have to Have It:::::Slather on the sunblock and welcome to The Nannies , where toddlers have stylists and a lost Sidekick can be the social kiss of death, cerulean blue swimming pools stretch to infinity and paparazzi camp out behind Starbucks, and a good nanny--like a celebrity without Botox--is hard to find. From the Trade Paperback edition.
