168214:::::The Satyricon:::::Satyricon (or Satyrica) is a Latin work of fiction in a mixture of prose &amp; poetry (prosimetrum). It's thought to have been written by Gaius Petronius Arbiter, tho the manuscript tradition identifies the author as a certain Titus Petronius. As with the Metamorphoses of Apuleius, classicists often describe it as a Roman novel, without necessarily implying continuity with the modern literary form. Surviving portions of the text detail the misadventures of the narrator, Encolpius, &amp; his lover, a handsome 16-year-old boy, Giton. Throughout the novel, Encolpius has a hard time keeping his lover faithful to him as he's constantly being enticed away by others. Encolpius's friend Ascyltus (who seems to have previously been in a relationship with Encolpius) is another major character. It's one of the two most extensive witnesses to the Roman novel, the only other being the fully extant Metamorphoses of Apuleius, which is quite different in style &amp; plot. Satyricon is also important evidence for the reconstruction of what everyday life may have been like for the lower classes during the early Roman Empire. The text was copied throughout the Middle Ages. In 1664 the 1st critical edition, which included Trimalchio s party, was put to print, thru the efforts of Pierre Petit. Satyricon has been translated into several languages &amp; has been one of the bestsellers of Western literature. Because of the status of the extant original texts, the true intent of the novel is unknown. It could be a satire with a moral component or a satyr in revenge for Nero's dismissal of Seneca.
