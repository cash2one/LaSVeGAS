23931:::::Nova Express:::::The Soft Machine introduced us to the conditions of a universe where endemic lusts of the mind and body pray upon men, hook them, and turn them into beasts. Nova Express takes William S. Burroughs s nightmarish futuristic tale one step further. The diabolical Nova Criminals Sammy The Butcher, Green Tony, Iron Claws, The Brown Artist, Jacky Blue Note, Izzy The Push, to name only a few have gained control and plan on wreaking untold destruction. It s up to Inspector Lee of the Nova Police to attack and dismantle the word and imagery machine of these control addicts before it s too late. This surrealist novel is part sci-fi, part Swiftian parody, and always pure Burroughs.
