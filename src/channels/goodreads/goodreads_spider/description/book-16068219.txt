16068219:::::The Heroes Of Time:::::Long ago, at the dawn of time, when the dragons of legend were young and unknown, and the grand tales of old had yet to be told, when the world was young and so were all of its inhabitants... Without warning, a great evil fell over the world. A planet-devouring dragon that called himself Sauluma descended from the cold infinite confines of space. He tore the world apart with misery, violence, and death, and shrouded the world in utter darkness. Many mighty heroes and their brave companions fought valiantly against Sauluma and his shadow minions in the attempt to destroy him, but none prevailed. But when all seemed lost, a wondrous team called The Heroes of Time arose. They banded together and stood as one to defeat Sauluma and his army of darkness! Sauluma s power was immense even for heroes with magical powers. Because of this, The Heroes of Time decided there was no other choice but to drain Sauluma of his remaining magical energy, then lock him away in a fragment of time. The heroes and their faithful companions were praised left and right, but inwardly, they weren t celebrating. They knew one day that Sauluma could return, but men forget quickly. The people grew used to their security and safety. When the heroes warned those in power about the dragon, they were dismissed time and time again. The Heroes of Time knew better, and continued to ponder the issue with their closest friends and allies. For the rest of their lives they dedicated themselves to find a way to return to life, no matter if it was decades, centuries, or millennia, for the time when Sauluma would return...
