239751:::::Bury Me Deep:::::Jean is on her way to Hawaii for a week of fun but the vacation gets off to a gruesome start. The boy beside her on the plane chokes and dies. Jean tries to push the incident out of her mind when she arrives on the island but it's impossible. Part of the reason is because Mike keeps coming back to her in dreams; horrible dreams filled with blood. Two of Jean's friends are awaiting her in Hawaii - Mandy and Michele. They have already made friends with two young men who teach scuba diving at the hotel, Dave and Johnny. Jean and Johnny quickly become friends but there are problems in paradise. Dave and Johnny have recently lost a partner in the ocean. No one knows how he died. No one can find his body. Then Jean does. It isn't where it's supposed to be and seems to have some life in it!
