87547:::::Confessions of a Record Producer: How to Survive the Scams and Shams of the Music Business:::::This fully updated and expanded book is not about how the music business should work, but how it does work. Industry insider Moses Avalon tells it like it is - how producers dip into budgets, artists steal songs, lawyers write contracts in code - and shows you how to survive these and other career-stifling situations. Deconstructing actual major and indie-label record deals, this book dissects each party's involvement and offers perspective on their actual roles, how much they get paid, and what their agendas really are. Engineers, managers, producers, artists, labels and lawyers each take their turn in the hot seat. It also outlines realistic alternatives for newcomers, such as "baby" production deals and vanity labels. This third edition includes: an entire chapter comparing ASCAP and BMI - a publishing first * new insights for indie artists, including the lowdown on digital-distribution scams and independent AandR * information on new legislation and its impact on sampling and other legal matters * new music-industry "family trees" that reflect recent consolidation and reorganization * 80 pages of new material * and much more.
