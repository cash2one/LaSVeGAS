10170217:::::Life and Laughing: My Story:::::Michael McIntyre is Britain's biggest comedy star. He has released two record-breaking DVDs, Live and Laughing and Hello Wembly ; hosts his own BAFTA-nominated BBC1 series, Michael McIntyre's Comedy Roadshow ; and has picked up British Comedy Awards for Best Live Stand-Up and Best Male TV Comic. Last year he became the youngest ever host of the Royal Variety Performance, and now in 2011 he takes the hot seat as a judge in the hit ITV show Britain's Got Talent. HOW DID HE GET THERE? Michael reveals all in his remarkably honest and hilarious autobiography, Life &amp; Laughing . His showbiz roots, his appalling attempts to attract the opposite sex, his fish-out-of-water move from public to state school and his astonishing journey from selling just one ticket at the Edinburgh Festival to selling half a million tickets on his last tour. Michael's story is riveting, poignant, romantic and above all very, very funny.
