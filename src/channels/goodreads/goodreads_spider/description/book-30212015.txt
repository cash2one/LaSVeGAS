30212015:::::Poesies Diverses:::::Arthur Rimbaud's meteoric career was crammed into four teenage years in which he wrote two masterpieces, The Illuminations and A Season in Hell, and some wonderful short poems. At nineteen he then rejected the literary life and left France. Oliver Bernard, poet and translator of Guillaume Apollinaire, presents both the French and Latin poems in bilingual form with lively and accurate prose versions and a useful and entertaining introduction. A selection of letters is also included. This is the best and most helpful presentation of the French genius' work for English-language readers and students of French poetry.Oliver Bernard's most recent collection of poems was Verse &amp;c (Anvil Press, 2001). He lives in Norfolk, England.
