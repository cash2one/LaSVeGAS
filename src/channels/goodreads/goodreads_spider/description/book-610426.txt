610426:::::End Times Fiction: A Biblical Consideration of the Left Behind Theology:::::Tim LaHaye contends that his bestselling Left Behind series (with Jerry Jenkins) is ""the first fictional portrayal of prophetic events that are true to the literal interpretation of Bible prophecy." " Gary DeMar takes issue with this bold claim, contending that the theological premise the series is based upon is only one interpretation of the book of Revelation. DeMar examines the series in four distinct sections: The Left Behind Sensation; Putting Tim LaHaye's Literalism to the Test; the Theology Behind Left Behind; and What Does it Mean and What Does it Matter? Readers will learn to develop a simple method of Bible interpretation and to assess the impact of "Left Behind" on the future of the church and our society.
