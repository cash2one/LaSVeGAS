9326998:::::Cloudy with a Chance of Boys:::::As the middle sister in a family with three girls, Stevie Reel doesn t know much about boys, and that s always been just fine with her. But lately, things have been changing: kids at school are starting to pair up, and Owen, the new boy in her Earth Science class, seems to have his sights set on her. The trouble is, Stevie doesn t want a boyfriend she s not even sure that she s ready to have a boy friend. And her sisters, who know exactly where they stand on the issue of boys, are no help: Alex is too busy trying to orchestrate a perfect, Romeo-and-Juliet-style first kiss from her crush, Scott Towel, while Joey can t understand why anyone would prefer a boy over a frog, anyway. If only figuring out boys were as easy as predicting the weather!
