17253180:::::Take a Chance on Me:::::Darek Christiansen is almost a dream bachelor oldest son in the large Christiansen clan, heir to their historic Evergreen Lake Resort, and doting father. But he s also wounded and angry since the tragic death of his wife, Felicity. No woman in Deep Haven dares come near. New assistant county attorney Ivy Madison simply doesn t know any better when she bids on Darek at the charity auction. Nor does she know that when she crafted a plea bargain three years ago to keep Jensen Atwood out of jail and in Deep Haven fulfilling community service, she was releasing the man responsible for Felicity s death. All Ivy knows is that the Christiansens feel like the family she s always longed for. And once she gets past Darek s tough exterior, she finds a man she could spend the rest of her life with. Which scares her almost as much as Darek learning of her involvement in his wife s case. Caught between new love and old grudges, Darek must decide if he can set aside the past for a future with Ivy a future more and more at risk as an approaching wildfire threatens to wipe out the Christiansen resort and Deep Haven itself.
