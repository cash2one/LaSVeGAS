2884299:::::Kingdom of Twilight:::::"Don't die," Gus whispered. He reached out and touched her hand. Were there superpowers that could bring her back? Would there be gods in Africa that could help them save her? "I stayed alive when you ordered me to. Now you return the favor, okay? Just . . . whatever you do, don't die." Ruthlessly stabbed by a fellow avatar, Diana suddenly finds herself hopelessly wandering through the underworlds, fighting her way past everything and anything vile, struggling to find a way back to life. Up above, her fellow avatars--Gus, Kali, and Tigre--have set sail to Africa, hoping to find refuge and a healer to bring Diana back from death. Time is racing against the avatars, because once Diana reaches the Greek underworld, Hades, she is gone. Forever. But that problem pales in comparison to the larger issue at hand--only one avatar can take back the power of the gods and live forever. Beautifully weaving together myth and realism, Tui T. Sutherland delivers the breath-taking conclusion to a trilogy that places the fate of the world in the outcome of a battle between power-hungry pantheons of gods and four teen avatars.
