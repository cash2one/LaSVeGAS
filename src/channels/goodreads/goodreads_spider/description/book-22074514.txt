22074514:::::Never Been Kissed:::::Sera Delos has a secret. She wishes it were something important or life-altering like owning a key to a blue Police Box that s home to a time-travelling alien, or that she must hide the secret identity of her alter-ego. No, Sera s secret is un-extraordinary. At twenty-five, she s never been kissed. There just haven t been many opportunities for the self-proclaimed nerd. There have always been too many shows to watch, too many books to read, and the rest of the time is spent fangirling over Tom Hiddleston. When the hottie next door and his son need a ride to the hospital, and Sera becomes the only available driver, her life is changed forever. Hunter MacLaine makes Dean Winchester seem like a mediocre-badass, even if he is a diabetic and doesn t think much of himself. An old flame, nerdy references and the ups and downs of slowly falling in love with her next door neighbour, Sera s wondering the obvious. Maybe, just maybe, if all the nerd-gods are smiling down on her, Sera Delos might have just found the man who her first kiss belongs to.
