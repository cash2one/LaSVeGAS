His books, from the National Book Award winning Death at an Early Age to his most recent, the critically acclaimed Shame of the Nation , are touchstones of the national conscience. First published in 1988 and based on the months the author spent among America s homeless, Rachel and Her Children is an unforgettable record of the desperate voices of men, women, and especially children caught up in a nightmarish situation that tears at the hearts of readers.
