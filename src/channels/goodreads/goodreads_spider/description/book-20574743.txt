Thanks to a forced implant, though, Alex is suddenly static unable to shift and male. Overnight, he s out to a world that neither understands nor tolerates shifters . . . and to his heterosexual boyfriend. Damon is stunned to discover his girlfriend is a shifter, and scared to death of the dangers the implant poses to Alex s health. He refuses to abandon Alex, but what about their relationship? Damon is straight, and with the implant both costly and dangerous to remove, Alex is stuck as a man. Stripped of half his identity and facing serious physical and social ramifications, Alex needs Damon more than ever, but he doesn t see how they can get through this. Especially if he s static forever. (This award-winning title is a revised and edited second edition of Static , originally released in 2011 by Amber Allure.)
