Constantly. Take my word when I say that you and Emi will become one. I felt every emotion as if I was in the story. I could have been Emi. - Kelli, Alphas, Authors and Books Oh My Emi Hennigan could never have predicted her life would be like this. After wasting more than ten years being just a friend to her true love, Nate Wilson, Emi feels more than a little regret. Her future was set, though. Nate loved her as much as she loved him, and they were moving forward with a romance that took them both by surprise. They already knew their bad habits, quirks and the subtle nuances of expressions, but the love was all-encompassing and new to them both. No man could compete, Emi thought, until one night one evening, one party, one journey, one second alters her course completely. That night, her brother s confident best friend, Jack Holland, comes back into her life with a mission: to spend more time with Emi to prove he is the right man for her. A romance with him is the furthest thing from Emi s mind, though, staying loyal and steadfast to a trusted man that she will always love. In a year s time, though, Emi must learn to make changes she d never before considered after being impacted by unexpected events. While her fragile spirit takes time to heal, Jack slowly finds a comfortable place in her life. Only time will tell if it s right for Emi and enough for him.
