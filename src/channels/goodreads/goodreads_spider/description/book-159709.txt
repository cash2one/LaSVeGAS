159709:::::The Devil's Apocrypha: There Are Two Sides to Every Story.:::::We all know that the victors of battle write the history. But what if that history is wrong? What if it is very, very wrong... We all know the tale of Satan's fall from grace. Of his defeat at the hands of the Lord God. But what really happened? A new manuscript has been uncovered. Written by a priest visited by the devil himself. A priest who then left the church to find three mad prophets who knew the truth. But one day, the priest was murdered and the manuscript disappeared. And now, over one hundred years later, the document has been found. It is a tale that begins before the univese was born... and ends with a chilling prophesy. And the truth is like nothing you've been told before.
