1557354:::::Class Picture Day!:::::In the words of 7-year-old Jessica Wakefield... I hate looking bad. And today I've got to look good! It's picture day for second-graders. That's me! No spills. No dirt. And no gum chewing. That's no problem for me. I always look perfect. Why should today be any different?
