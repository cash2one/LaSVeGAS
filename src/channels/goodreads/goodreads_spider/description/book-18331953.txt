18331953:::::Finding Infinity:::::"Finding Infinity" as described by Colin... "Fine Charlie. Colin says dropping his hands in defeat. Here's what I want. I want everybody to back off and let me play football. I want you to go back to practicing medicine because I m ready for you to be happy again - not this forced shit that you keep trying to sell me. I want Brad to get his house finished because I m tired of listening to his DIY project updates. I want Jenny to decide on a hair color. I want Aiden and Rachael to either figure their shit out or leave each other alone, because Aiden s chick drama is annoying. I want Mark to quit trying so hard to be my buddy again. I want my parents to get off my back about us living in sin. I want you to pick a date to marry me. That s what I want. What am I going to get? None of it, because I have to do another interview to try to patch the gaping wound that is my life with a Band-Aid. This is book three of the "Infinity Series." To read them in order, please start with "Falling Into Infinity" and then "From Now Until Infinity."
