22320979:::::The Weight of Snow: New & Selected Poems:::::In The Weight of Snow, author B. L. Bruce explores the many plights of the human species, from the mysteries of the heart and the inescapability of death, to the depths of human emotion. Told from the perspective of a poetic naturalist, Bruce shares her appreciation of the wild, illuminating the profound in the mundane while chronicling the natural world as both an observer and as an irrefutable part of it. Her poems focus strongly on image and locality, conjuring the imaginations of readers and celebrating the beauty in the follies of the human condition and its capacity to grip the soul. This second edition of her debut collection The Weight of Snow was the 2014 International Book Awards poetry finalist and the 2014 USA Best Book Awards poetry finalist.
