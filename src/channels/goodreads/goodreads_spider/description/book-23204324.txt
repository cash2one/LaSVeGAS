23204324:::::Soul to Take:::::Vicky is desperate to make her mark, in a world which just doesn t seem to notice her. Silence and smiles hide the pain that Nell is keeping to herself. Sarah s dreams of having a family seem hopeless. And then there s Shannon, who s in trouble at school yet again. But what these four women don t know is that someone - or something - is watching them. A much-recycled Soul, suspended between one life and the next, realises that Vicky, Nell, Sarah and Shannon are embarking on their journey towards Motherhood. As memories from past incarnations return to this Soul, it becomes clear that one of these women will be chosen, above the rest, to deliver it once more. Soul to Take explores what is is to become a parent and considers the possibility that maybe, it is our children who carefully select us to be a temporary custodian of their Soul.
