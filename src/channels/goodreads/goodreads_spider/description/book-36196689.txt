36196689:::::Sugar:::::***SUGAR IS A FULL LENGTH STANDALONE ROMANCE*** Country s hottest bad boy. That s what they call me. My label ate it up until I became too bad for the good folks of country music. That s when Hard Candy Records picked me up and took a chance on me. Probably not their smartest move, but I won t tell them that. Especially when they ve assigned me a babysitter to try and keep my ass out of trouble. One smart-mouthed, unimpressed, sexy as homegrown sin, Addy Mae Masterson. She likes to pretend that she doesn t like me and I like to let her. I may have a past that haunts me and she may have a habit of getting attached, but damn if I don t want to show her just how good this bad boy can be.
