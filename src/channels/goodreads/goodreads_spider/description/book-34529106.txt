34529106:::::All About the D:::::He's the sinfully sexy, off-limits client whose naughty blog showcases his best "asset." His prim and proper attorney has never been more tempted to mix business with pleasure... All About the D is a sexy new romantic comedy from USA Today bestselling author Lex Martin and bestselling author Leslie McAdam! I'm known for being formal. Meticulous. Professional. So you d never suspect I spend my nights photographing my impressive junk for a NSFW blog. Don t roll your eyes. I m not bragging. I have millions of followers who ll tell you they live for my posts. I m like a superhero, saving humanity one dick pic at a time. Except leading a double life means I need someone to help me protect my anonymity, so that no one, especially my family, ever discovers my online celebrity. When I call one of the most respected law firms in town, I expect quality legal advice and confidentiality. Not a sinfully sexy attorney whose dangerous curves and soul-piercing gray eyes make me want to personally demonstrate my particular skill set. I shouldn t be tempted. Especially when she knows all of my best-kept secrets. But everyone has a breaking point. And I ve met mine. *** All About the D is a full-length standalone and FREE on Kindle Unlimited. Due to adult situations and sexual content, it's recommended for readers over the age of 18. ***
