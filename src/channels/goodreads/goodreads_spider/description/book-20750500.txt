20750500:::::Because of Kian:::::I know I m twisted. Growing up in a perfectly well-adjusted home, I don t really have an excuse. But no matter I realize how messed up I am. And therapy can only do so much. I pushed my boyfriend to violence, a violence he couldn't control. Sickly, I almost liked it. So I pushed him more. Before long, the pain outweighed the pleasure and the loss I sustained shattered me. So I ran. I m now a bit shell-shocked harboring a lot of guilt. My boyfriend is now my ex and wants revenge. He wants me to pay for turning him into the monster he s become. And I still have a deviant yearning that I don t understand. My own monster inside my own demon to battle. I can t get close to anyone. I can t give in and scratch that itch. I can t wreck someone else. And now there is Kian my rescuer on a dark, painful night. He sees through my pretense. He tries to pull me from my frightened isolation, to keep me from becoming a victim. He forces me to face my warped desires and shows me that pain doesn t really have to truly hurt. He wants to show me a way to serenity. But I am afraid Will I ruin a good man? ***** Mature Content, Abuse, Sexual Situations, Adult Situations, Strong Language *****
