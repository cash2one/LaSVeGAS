13442922:::::Everyone Has a Boss:::::(Available on Amazon.com) When our parents told us to get a job, they didn t tell us how to be an employee. No one did. Having a sweet phone voice and knowing QuickBooks is great, but what a boss really wants is someone who helps the business succeed. Someone who ll finish tasks and not ask Where is it? when they re told to get the Johnson file. Whether you re blue or white collar, becoming a better employee is in your own best interest. Sure, it makes your boss look good and the company more profitable, but being worth more also means a bigger paycheck and a quicker promotion. "Give this book to every employee in your office. The information here is so valuable that your employees or coworkers will thank you. David Sneed has a story to tell and he tells it in a way that will engage and delight and I cannot imagine anyone not feeling motivated and raring to go after completing it. The best attributes of this particular guide is that the author not only details the specific behaviors that lead to success as an employee but he follows this advice with first hand examples, from his own life, on how to accomplish these behaviors and make a habit of them. 5 stars, recommended."
