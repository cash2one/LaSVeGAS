809428:::::Sort of Forever:::::Sally Warner breaks new ground with a powerful story about the toughest test of friendship. For as long as Cady Winton can remember, she and Nana Weber have done everything together, from cutting each other's hair to daring themselves to ride the scariest roller coaster at Magic Mountain. And both had been looking forward to starting middle school together in the fall. But just when Cady and Nana were anticipating being teenagers, their plans spin away from them. At the age of twelve, Nana is diagnosed with bone cancer, and suddenly the present is so much more important than the future. With refreshing honesty, Sally Warner helps brush aside the mysticism of dying and replaces it with the courage of friendship. Comforting and profoundly moving, Sort of Forever is, by turns, a sincere, funny, painful, and uplifting view of dying, as well as a celebration of life.
