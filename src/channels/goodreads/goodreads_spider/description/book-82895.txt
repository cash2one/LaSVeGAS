82895:::::A Man:::::"What's the point anyway Of suffering, dying? It teaches us to live, boy. A man who does not struggle does not live, he survives." (quote from the book) The book is a pseudo-biography about Alexandros Panagoulis written in the form of a novel. Fallaci had an intense romantic relationship with Panagoulis. She uses the novel to put forth her view that Panagoulis was assassinated by a vast conspiracy, a view widely shared by many Greeks.
