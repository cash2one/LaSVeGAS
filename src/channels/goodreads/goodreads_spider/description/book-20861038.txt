20861038:::::The Darkness and the Light:::::Bipolar disorder simultaneously gives you both an amazing and a terrible outlook on life. This is a book of Melissa Burke s personal journal entries as well as some poems, written over the past few years. The goal is to shed light on mental illness for people who don t understand it while at the same time reminding those who do suffer from it that they aren't alone. This is also to show that even if you don t have any mental illness, life can be a roller coaster. But things do get better. Perfect? No, never. But life doesn't have to be perfect to become a beautiful journey. ***TRIGGER WARNING*** You know by the description that this deals with bipolar disorder. One of the specific things is sexual assault. In general there is a lot of depression, therefore many mentions of self harm as well as an eating disorder, etc. I would love for people to buy/read this book but if you will be triggered by any of that PLEASE do NOT read it.
