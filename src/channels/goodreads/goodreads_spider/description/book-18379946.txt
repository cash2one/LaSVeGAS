18379946:::::Jahleel:::::This. Book. Is. About. OBSESSION It is NOT a traditional romance. It deviates from the norm. It defies...EVERYTHING. This. Book. Is. About. OBSESSION __________________________________________________ A TRUE-ly fabricated story about Love &amp; Obsession... I m an idiot. I m too stupid to be human. Too stupid to live. I lack common sense. I used to be a normal human being. Until the guy in the red hoodie. Just a glance, and I was owned. Enslaved. What s worst? He didn t even notice me. Yep. You guessed right: I m delusional. I m obsessed. I m a stalker. A martyr. A masochist. I ve allowed my obsession to lead me down into a deep, dark pit, selfishly hurting everyone around me, and only his requited love can pull me out of it. But I won t apologize for it. I won t apologize for being in love with Jahleel Kingston. I ve loved him at first sight. I ve loved him for five empty years. I ve loved him through all his bullcrap and asshole-isms. I love him even now. My name is Saskia Day. I m British. I m famous. I m stinking rich. And this is my pathetic story. Read at your own bloody risk.
