348187:::::Red Moon Rising: How 24-7 Prayer Is Awakening a Generation:::::An extraordinary story about the adventure of faith and the power of persevering prayer On a summer's day in 1727 a community of Moravians started praying and didn't stop for more than 100 years. Throughout history God has mobilised such movements and moments of 24/7 prayer - from the Upper Room of Pentecost to Azusa Street in Los Angeles, through ancient Celtic saints and extraordinary characters like Alexander the Sleepless. This is the story of a movement of the Spirit in our time, a move as ancient as it is modern. As young people desert the church and AIDS orphans Africa, a new generation is learning to pray and obey like never before. From Communist China to Washington DC and from the ranks of the Salvation Army to anarchic German punks, the 24-7 Prayer movement has been interceding continually, night and day, since 1999 in more than fifty countries. This is their extraordinary story; an honest account of pain and perseverance alongside pioneering mission and miraculous answers to prayer.
