8477626:::::Amber Magic:::::The humans have no magic and are hunted for sport, but that is about to change. War is coming... The Sun Dragon spawned nine lesser dragons which devoured their parent for the power the elder possessed. These young dragons fought for choice bits of the Sun Dragon, but each only managed to eat a portion, thus giving them specific powers. Over time, these foul creatures were hunted down and slain by heroes of old. When each body rotted away, nothing was left save for a Jewel the lens of each dragon s left eye. These Nine Eyes, or Jewels, form the basis for all magic in the world... The Haven series is the story of the nine Jewels of power, each representing a different form of magic. The Red Jewel, Sang, gives the wielder power over Blood Magic. The Blue, Lavatis, can call the Rainbow and rules the Sky... Amber Magic is a short introductory book in this epic series of fantasy novels. The book is 200 pages in print form.
