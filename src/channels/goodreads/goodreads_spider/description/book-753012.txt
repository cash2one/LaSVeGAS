Arranged in nearly 30 categories (eating and drinking, men, women, and marriage; friendship; money and frugalitiy; religion; professions and occupations, etc.), they include suck familiar phrases as: Early to bed and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise. Haste makes waste. Love your Neighbour; yet don't pull down your Hedge. He that lies down with Dogs, shall rise up with fleas. Hunger never saw bad bread. He's a Fool that makes his Doctor his Heir. He that has not got a Wife, is not yet a compleat Man. An ideal sourcebook for writers, public speakers, and students, this practical and entertaining little book will also delight general reads with its rich store of time-honored fold wisdom.
