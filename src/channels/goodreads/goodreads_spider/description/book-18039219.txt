18039219:::::Derek:::::Rylie Sullivan hasn t had an easy life. She is broken, so broken she doesn t think she will ever be fixed. When she meets Derek, he barges into her life and tries to break down the walls she has so carefully construed to keep what s left of her safe. When Rylie s past mixes with her present, will Derek stand by her and help her survive? Or will he bail for the next pretty thing? Derek Tremaine has had it easy. Coming from a wealthy family and blessed with good looks, Derek has breezed through life. After years of one night stands, and a few half ass attempts at relationships, Derek has almost given up on ever finding the woman for him. When he sees Rylie however, he can t help but be drawn to her. Rylie is different, more so than any other person Derek has met. Rylie s beauty- her tattoos, piercings and beautiful blonde dreads drew him in, but it s her sweet, kind nature that makes him want to stay around and protect her. Winning Rylie s heart will be his greatest challenge yet, but Derek knows the reward will be more than worth it. Which is why Derek has no intentions of letting her go. Intended for mature audiences.
