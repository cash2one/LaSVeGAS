25224752:::::House Of Hope International Cookbook:::::Since its foundation, the House of Hope International* retreat center has cooked and provided meals for numerous religious order members in need of rest from their labors. In this unique context of retreat ministry and hospitality, House volunteers including Dr. Denise Marie Mari, Lynn Marie Knapke and Aaron Shaun Brennan have been blessed to learn much about saintly founders and friends of religious communities in the USA and abroad; and, in many cases, to receive stories through convent and monastery kitchen personnel. The House of Hope Int l kitchen began to prepare or cook relatively unknown recipes to satisfy the tastes of clergy/religious guests. Not only does this one-of-a-kind Cookbook contain religious order founder facts and original recipes but it also features special bonus material such as founder quotes, fun-n-easy songs to sing in the kitchen, food proverbs, cooking jokes, and religious order blessings or grace said with meals. We hope this Cookbook will draw readers closer to the Heart of Jesus the Divine Chef, the best power source for those clergy/religious and lay people who wish to serve with love from the kitchen to the dining table and beyond. *All proceeds from this Cookbook will support House of Hope Int l programs for ordained and consecrated persons in need of rejuvenation.
