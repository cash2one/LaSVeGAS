6467853:::::Long Past Stopping: A Memoir:::::Oran Canfield son of self-help guru and Chicken Soup for the Soul creator Jack Canfield tells his surreal story of growing up in Long Past Stopping. In this remarkable memoir, writing with a wry and cutting edge, Canfield relates tales of a childhood in flux being buffeted about among family friends, relatives, rebels, and born-again circus clowns, in an anarchist private school, communes, and libertarian enclaves and of a young adulthood spent among the ruins of heroin addiction. Long Past Stopping is Oran Canfield s often hilariously harrowing tale of surviving life in the strange lane.
