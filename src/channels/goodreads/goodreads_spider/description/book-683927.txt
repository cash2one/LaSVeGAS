683927:::::The History of the Quranic Text from Revelation to Compilation: A Comparative Study with the Old and New Testaments:::::With full colour images, meticulously annotated and researched, The History of the Qur anic Text provides unique insights into the Qur an s immaculate preservation throughout its history, covering such topics as how divine revelations were received, Prophet Muhammad s role in teaching and disseminating these verses, the text s compilation under his guidance and the setting of its final shape shortly after his death. It also looks at the origins of Arabic, its palaeography and orthography, the so-called Mushaf of Ibn Mas ud, and the strict methodology employed in assembling textual fragments. This scholarly work provides an essential basis for sincere study of the Qur an at a time when mis-representation of Islam s Holy Book has become all too common. The author also investigates the histories of the Old and New Testaments, relying entirely on Judeo-Christian sources, and by so doing the book attains an absolutely epic scope. Through this the author makes a sophisticated and passionate case for questioning the aims of Western scholarship towards Islam s Holy Book and illustrates convincingly that such research, motivated by more than mere curiosity, has no scientific bearing on the Qur an s integrity. A truly monumental effort, an indispensable tool for Muslims and non-Muslims alike, this work presents a cogent and powerful argument for the Qur an s unique inviolability and will serve as a cornerstone addition to any personal library and Islamic curriculum.
