6304911:::::PostSecret: Confessions on Life, Death, and God:::::For the past four years, Frank Warren, known as "the most trusted stranger in America," has invited people all over the world to send him creatively decorated postcards bearing secrets they have never before revealed. Warren's fifth book presents a never-before-seen collection of the most personal PostSecrets he's ever received those dealing with life, death, and issues of faith and belief. The book lays bare the confessions of people at every stage of life, from every major faith (or from no faith). Warren's latest collection of secrets is his most profoundly moving yet.
