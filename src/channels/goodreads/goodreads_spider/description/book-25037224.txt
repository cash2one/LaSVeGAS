25037224:::::Enlightenment:::::Kayn lost everything and everyone she loved in a brutal attack on her family. Kayn is now an Ankh; Kevin is a Triad, her enemy, with all memory of Kayn wiped from his mind. Can his love for her survive? Will she be able to find the strength to stand against him when the time comes? Ankh must assimilate and train its three new members. At least Kayn is not alone as the only newbie. They ve lost just as much as she. It s part of the deal...the family never survives. Bonding with their new clan and forgetting the past is critical. Kayn must learn to fight. She must learn to do impossible things, and make choices that leave a dent in her soul and an ache in her heart. The mortal version of right and wrong is now irrelevant. Her twin, Chloe, while dead, still feels part of her. Will Chloe be able to take over Kayn's body? Frost keeps watching her, waiting. She feels a pull to Frost, but is it real or a Chloe memory? She longs for Kevin, but her twin's attachment to Frost is causing her emotional conflict. Can Kevin s and her love survive? Will Kevin remember her? The Testing is coming. Kayn must learn to fight and die, and stand back up to fight and die again to get through The Testing. Will she survive and what will she become? Is her destiny set? Will she find enlightenment? This is not a fairytale. This is a nightmare.
