13574880:::::God is Just: A Defense of the Old Testament Civil Laws:::::This book is a defense of biblical civil law, on topics despised not only by humanists, but by professing Christians. It is, in short, theonomic apologetics. God is Just takes our culture and its attacks on the Bible to task. It defends biblical theocracy, justice, and slavery, and cuts humanistic opposition down to size by its own self-destructive foolishness, and, most importantly, by the sword of God s word. In addition, the book includes appendices defending theonomy biblically and historically, as well as appendices refuting alternative political philosophies. God is Just includes contributions from two of the most prolific next-generation theonomic writers, Buddy Hanson and Daniel F. N. Ritchie. Hanson (of Grace and Law Resource Center) wrote the forward, and Ritchie (of Reformed Worldview Books) wrote an appendix. Additionally, the second edition includes a new appendix by Vindiciae Legis, who gives an excellent historical treatment of the theonomic views of the Westminster divines. Legis has previously written defenses of historical theonomy for Theonomy Resources.
