2869119:::::Must Love Black:::::NANNY FOR 10-YR-OLD TWINS. MAINE COAST. OWN ROOM - GENEROUS SALARY. MUST LOVE BLACK. Must love black? Sounds like a coffee-loving, seclusion-seeking goth girl's dream job. Philippa isn't fazed by the fog-enshrouded mansion on a cliff, the weirdest twins on the planet, or even the rumors about ghosts, 'cause when she meets the estate's hot gardener, Philippa's pretty sure she's found her dream boy, too. Too bad Geoff's already taken - by a girl whose wardrobe is head-to-toe pink. Still, Philippa can't get Geoff out of her head. What will it take to lure him to the dark side?
