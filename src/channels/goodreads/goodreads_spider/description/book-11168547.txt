11168547:::::like a Virgin:::::You know that bit in The X Factor , when the singer tells everyone about the rocky road they travelled to pursue their dream? Well, that's Gracie Flowers' story. Gracie is very focused for a woman of almost twenty-six. Her favourite book is The 5-Year Plan: Making the Most of Your Life . And her five-year plan is going very well. That is, until she usurped from her big promotion by a handsome, posh idiot; she is dumped by her boyfriend; and discovers her loopy mother is facing bankruptcy. Hormones awry and ice cream over-ordered, a dream Gracie thought she'd buried ten years ago begins to resurface. A dream that reminds her of the girl she used to be and everything she wanted to become.
