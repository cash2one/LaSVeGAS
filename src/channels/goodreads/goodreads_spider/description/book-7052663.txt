7052663:::::Unleashing the Storm:::::BONUS: This edition contains an excerpt from Sydney Croft's Taken by Fire. Feel the heat. Hear the roar. The fever has begun... There s a storm rising. Electricity crackles in the air. For Kira Donovan, it s that time of year again: when the need floods her flesh, when almost any man the bigger and the stronger the better will do. For Kira, an animal psychic, the heat is a matter of life and death, and this year it has come at just the right time. Tom Knight, a natural-born predator, has arrived at her isolated Idaho farm for reasons all his own. . . . At first Kira isn t interested in Knight s motives. She only needs him his body, his hands, his scent. But soon, through a daze of desire and distrust, Kira discovers Knight s world the world of a covert operative, one man among dozens of secret agents waging an astonishing global war. Knight s mission is to bring Kira kicking and screaming if necessary into the Agency for Covert Rare Operatives and harness her extraordinary gift. He never expected the powerful emotions she would ignite in him, or the fierce desire to keep her safe from harm. For as darkness gathers around them, Kira is feeling the heat once again, leading them both on a wild ride of delicious thrills . . . and terror beyond imagining.
