3526474:::::The Reluctant Buddhist:::::This book is about Buddhism, and the pursuit of happiness. The author takes us on an intensely personal journey into the practice of Nichiren Buddhism, which has now been embraced by many millions of people around the world. It is not in any way about a remote, abstract, inaccessible, philosophy. It is about Buddhism in daily life; about learning in a wholly practical way, how to build a better and happier life for yourself, and for those whom your life touches, no matter what the circumstances. You don't have to conform to a specific lifestyle. You don't have to be especially knowledgeable or dedicated or indeed religious in any way. Nichiren Buddhism teaches the extraordinary truth that happiness is not a matter of chance or accident, but essentially, a matter of choice, and that we can all learn how to make that choice.
