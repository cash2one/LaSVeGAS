12805244:::::Moonlight Becomes You:::::This edition is no longer available. Eleven years ago Shane Ventura made the biggest mistake of his life when he caved in to pressure from his record label to kick his best friend Jesse Seider out of their band, Luck. Though he had a gorgeous voice, Jesse wasn t beautiful, and didn t fit the label s ideal look. But Shane s never wanted anyone else more, and all the sex and alcohol in the world can t fill the void Jesse left behind. As his thirty-second birthday approaches, Shane feels more miserable than ever. Even the prospect of teaming up with Britain s hottest band, Moonlight, for an epic world tour can t get him out of his depressive funk. Until he meets lead singer, Kayden Berlin, and falls into instant lust. Though Kayden acts like he s not interested, Shane knows he feels the spark between them. But the harder Shane pushes, the more Kayden pulls away. Then one explosive night things finally come to a head and Shane is left nursing a broken heart. That seems to be Shane s lot lucky at everything but love, the one thing that matters most. But there s a lesson Shane still hasn t learned: when it comes to love, you can t always leave things to chance.
