1429768:::::Wishes, Kisses, and Pigs:::::Eleven-year-old Louise Tolliver lives with her mother and her brother, Willie, in Tollivers' Hollow. Like any brother, Willie gives Louise a hard time, but the trouble really starts when Louise calls him a pig -- and he becomes one. And that's not all. Louise's father has been missing for seven years, and the locals are starting to wonder about Tollivers' Hollow. It's now up to Louise to use her wishes for good and make right all that's gone wrong. She uses her head, her heart, and a little bit of magic to bring her family back home.
