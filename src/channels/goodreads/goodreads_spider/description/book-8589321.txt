Inside, you'll encounter animals armed with sharp claws and killer jaws, deep-sea monsters, poisonous plants, and frogs falling from the sky, not to mention some of the world's most accident-prone humans. Explore the hottest and highest places on Earth, get lost in Antarctic wastes, and consider the end of the world and whether or not it's near. And just when you think you're done, you'll come face-to-face with the most dangerous mathematical formula in history. Don't let the encyclopedic structure, funky mixed-media designs, facts, stats, and stories lull you into a false sense of security. Danger! is filled with peril, risk, and suspense.
