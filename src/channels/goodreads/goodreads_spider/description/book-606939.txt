606939:::::Sky Rider:::::News that her beloved horse, Tazz, must be put down has made the constant pain of Dusty's old back injury doubly sharp. But the night before the vet comes for Tazz, a mysterious teenager, the ghost of a young man who died a strange and violent death on her family's property, appears to Dusty and offers to take Tazz away with him. Away where? Dusty wonders, but Tazz trusts the boy. Dusty's beloved horse seems healed, willing to leap right over the sun, and so she lets him go with the stranger. It isn't long however, before the boy returns, and Dusty realizes she must help him find peace--or become entangled with his vengeful spirit for eternity.
