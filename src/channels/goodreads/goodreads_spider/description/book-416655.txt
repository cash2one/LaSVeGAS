"I wish I could get into a boy's head for just twenty-four hours and see what goes on on in there." "You wouldn't find a lot," said Squidge, laughing. "Not in Mac's head anyway." Mac has three secret wishes: 1) Before he finds true love, he can date as many girls as possible, 2) he becomes a famous cartoonist, and 3) his parents get back together so that he can live in London again.

However, he discovers that success, in love and work, sometimes comes at a high price. Is he ready to pay it?
