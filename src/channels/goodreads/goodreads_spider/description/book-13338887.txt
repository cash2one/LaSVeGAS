She goes each day under guard to the commander s house and stands waiting in case the commander should want some music. Also living in the house is the commander s son, Karl. A handsome young man who seems completely disengaged from what is happening around him. Hanna hates him as he sits drawing in the music room.

Before she knows it she has fallen in love with the wrong boy.
