22231870:::::Caught Up in Her:::::Discover the thrillingly romantic New York Times and USA Today Bestselling Caught Up in Love series by Lauren Blakely, the author of Seductive Nights! A sweet romance so perfect it could have been scripted by Hollywood. But can a first love survive past the first summer?... I'm not going to say it was love at first sight when I met her. I don't believe in that. Because love isn't about falling for someone's looks. Though she was beautiful in every single way, from her dark, wavy hair to her gorgeous brown eyes, to the soft curves of her body. But that's not why I fell so hard for her that summer. She took my breath away for reasons that had nothing to do with her looks. It was the the movies, the conversations, the walks through the small town, the nights on the beach with the waves rolling in, the way I could hold her hand and feel as if the world had simply melted away and we were all that was left. So, there was no love-at-first-sight. That would come later, and if it happened first it would take away all the reasons that stayed with me for the next five years. Even though you're not supposed to fall for your best friend's little sister. But that didn't stop me...
