35706684:::::The Dead Silence:::::The book explores the complex psychological issues relating to the dark side of motherhood. Its subject is rarely written or discussed even in the protected privacy of a psychiatrist s care. People prefer to keep it deep inside and don`t dare to speak it aloud. But there are those who are not able to say a single word even if they wanted to. Those who were deprived not only of childhood, but sometimes their life itself. They are destined to the silent suffering, trying to survive in the chilling embrace of the "dead" mother. The main character Dr. Sam Haley is a successful psychiatrist who is trying to help one of his special patients Anna to cope with the dark side of motherhood. Is he ready to open his eyes wider and understand? Will he step aside from the usual terms and plunge into the world of children's helplessness and fear? Will he manage to save another soul from the imminent death?
