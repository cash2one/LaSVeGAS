3130076:::::The Magic in Your Touch:::::When Dr. Nathan "Nate" Morris moves to Reed, Illinois to open a medical practice, he's looking forward to putting the past--and his homophobic family--behind him. When Nate is attacked outside his office late one night in an apparent gay bashing, he starts to wonder if maybe the good folks of Reed aren't as accepting as he thought. Sheriff Brandon Nash, an openly gay man holding an elected position, finds it hard to believe that Nate's attack is really a hate crime. Brandon, looking into Nate's frightened eyes, knows there's one thing he's absolutely certain of: he'll do whatever it takes to keep Nate safe or die trying. As Nate's assailant steps up his efforts, Nate and Brandon's budding romance is put to the test. Nate decides to leave Reed behind, believing everyone else will be safe once he's gone. This book is definitely one that you can't put down until the very end because of the many twists and turns. Find out the mystery surrounding Nate's attack, and if Nate and Brandon's relationship can survive the stress and strain of their real life professions.
