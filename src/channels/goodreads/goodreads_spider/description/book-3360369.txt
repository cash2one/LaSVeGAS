3360369:::::The Serial Garden: The Complete Armitage Family Stories:::::This is the first complete collection of Joan Aiken s beloved Armitage stories and it includes four new, unpublished stories. After Mrs. Armitage makes a wish, the Armitage family has interesting and unusual experiences every Monday (and the occasional Tuesday). The Board of Incantation tries to take over their house to use as a school for young wizards; the Furies come to stay; and a cutout from a cereal box leads into a beautiful and tragic palace garden. Charming and magical, the uncommon lives of the Armitage family will thrill and delight. Includes Joan Aiken s Prelude from Armitage, Armitage, Fly Away Home , as well as introductions from Joan Aiken s daughter, Lizza Aiken, and best-selling author Garth Nix. Illustrated by Andi Watson.
