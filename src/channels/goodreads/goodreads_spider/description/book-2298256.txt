2298256:::::No Time for Sergeants:::::When the man from the draft board arrives to take country bumpkin Will Stockdale to Callville for induction into the army, Will's father chases him off. But even hastily erected barbed wire cannot prevent Uncle Sam from claiming this draftee, and soon Will is on a bus to Fort Thompson, Georgia. In the barracks, our hapless hero meets little Ben Whitledge, a fellow trainee who thinks he deserves a medal simply because his grandfather fought under Stonewall Jackson. This odd duo is assigned to the elite air force, though they would rather serve in that most glorious and revered branch of the army - the infantry. Sergeant King, Will's nemesis, is determined to dampen the young soldier's enthusiasm, but Will - even in his long stint as latrine orderly - consistently prevails and unknowingly confounds the gruff sergeant at every turn.
