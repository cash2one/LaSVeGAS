1078638:::::It Had to Be You:::::As the new, secret ("shhh!!!") Dear Daisy, I must be an expert on romance, right? Wrong. Here I am living next door to Kyle, who is friendly, polite, and devastatingly cute in his board shorts--yet I act like a drama queen every time we talk. That's not me, really! How can I (as Daisy) give love advice to someone called "Romeo14" if I can't even get Kyle to ask me out? But I've got to keep trying. Because what if he's "the one"?
