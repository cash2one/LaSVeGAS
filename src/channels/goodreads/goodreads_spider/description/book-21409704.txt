21409704:::::Sanctuary:::::Usually, when the good guys kill the big bad, the world is saved and it's happily ever after. But that wasn't the case this time, or any time actually, not with Liz McBeth and her family of champions. With Klein dead, the threat seemed far away. But with Klein's death, the real menace appeared. The ArchDemons were the real masterminds behind the vampiric messiah movement, and they're not finished yet. Luckily, the Earth hasn't run out of heroes just yet. SPECIAL: As a thanks to all of my friends who have helped me bring "The Keeper" to life, please make sure to check out the preview to "The Keeper: Unveiled"! The entire first chapter of the fifth book is included at the end of the book. Don't miss it!
