10471443:::::The Underdogs:::::#1 New York Times bestseller Mike Lupica tackles football! Will Tyler can fly on a football field. He may not be the biggest running back around, but no one can touch him when it comes to hitting the hole and finding the end zone. And no one can match his love of the game. When Will has a football in hand, he may as well be flying for real because life can't touch him - his dad isn't so defeated, his town isn't so poor, and everyone has something to cheer for. All of which does him no good if the football season is canceled. With no funding for things like uniforms and a cared-for playing field, with seemingly every other family moving to find jobs, there simply isn't enough money or players for a season. Unless one kid can rally an entire town and give everyone a reason to believe . . . For fans of his bestselling novels Travel Team and Million-Dollar Throw , Mike Lupica delivers a feel-good sports story that will have readers cheering where they sit. There's plenty of action for sports fans, and readers will root for Will and his teammates till the very last page. School Library Journal [F]ootball fans will respond to the detailed and exciting game action once the season gets rolling and find inspiration in Will and his teammates' tenacity. Publisher s Weekly Will's ingenuity and loyalty are encouraging, causing readers to want to cheer him on as he makes his dream come true. VOYA
