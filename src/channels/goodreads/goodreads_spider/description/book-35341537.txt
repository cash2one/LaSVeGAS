35341537:::::Imperfect Love: Twisted:::::Three friends walk into a bar . . . One walks out the fake girlfriend of a hot, bearded Scotsman. Fannin McGuire is up for promotion at Tate and Cane Enterprises, but first she has to make it through her stepsister s wedding. To Fannin s ex. Yep. Her ex-fianc is about to be her new brother-in-law. One big happy family. And lucky her, she also gets to work with him. While Fannin is putting all of her energy into her career, her ex is putting all of his energy into making her life hell. Just when Fannin is sure she ll be attending the wedding without a plus one, in walks Jasper James to save the day. He s the bartender at the Iron Flask, the account she s trying to land, and everything she didn t know she needed or wanted. Before Fannin knows what s happening, Jasper is playing knight in shining armor and she likes it. And him. A lot. With his smooth Scottish accent, ridiculously good looks, and that beard? She doesn t stand a chance. Jasper isn t in the habit of rescuing anyone. But when Fannin is confronted by her ex about her lack of a date for his upcoming nuptials, Jasper can t help but step in. Her wild hair, violet eyes, and killer legs have him doing a few things he normally wouldn t. Never mind that he shouldn t be getting involved with the woman in charge of making the bar a global success. Their fake relationship becomes more real than either thought it would. Now they re at the mercy of their feelings when truths are twisted, and the lies don t taste as smooth as the whisky
