7675580:::::The Garden Key:::::Madeleine Winger's thoughts consume her. This college coed's mental object of affection is a gorgeous dark-haired, green-eyed musician. She can't stop her mind from filling with idealistic perceptions and fantastical scenarios starring him. Every time she sees him at church or when he comes into the music store where she works, Maddy is sure she will need a defibrillator to restart her heart. She doesn't even know his name, nor has she ever spoken to him, but she can't stop her heart and mind from their unending crush on this guy, for over a year now. Maddy proclaims herself a "lust-o-holic." Maddy knows she must learn the real way to have a relationship with a guy. Not the gotta-jump-into-bed-with-him-so-he'll-like-me, kind of way. Maddy knows all too well from her past that this tactic never works. Besides, Peter is different from any other guy she has dated in the past. Peter is the guitar player in a local up and coming garage band, who has made a fresh recommitment to his faith. Maddy would be the first woman he has dated in a year. It's so different this time for him-dating God's way. It is a tale of pure sweetness and beauty as two people learn to love each other under the hand of the Almighty. Maddy must also cope with her promiscuous dorm roommate, as well as her plastic surgery obsessed bleach blonde mother, who is persistently critical of Maddy's dyed-black hair and Gothic style. Can Peter and Maddy wrestle with their desires and keep their thoughts in check, and their hands off of each other? Their tale of relationship trials and triumphs will make you laugh out loud and you'll probably cry too, so keep a tissue or two handy. THE GARDEN KEY, the prelude novel to MIND OVER MADELEINE, is a New Adult genre tale of lust, redemption and really good cheeseburgers that will move you as it illustrates the urgent need for faith in our lives, especially when it comes to love relationships.
