20521902:::::Undercover with the Hottie:::::Amanda and Will are back! This time, they're heading to New York City the day after Christmas. The mission: stop an assassination plot against the UN Secretary General. Aunt Christie and her partner Nic, are back as well, and playing the role of the parents on the undercover operation. As for Amanda and Will, they're still adjusting to the boyfriend-girlfriend thing, but while in the Big Apple, they are pretending to be brother and sister. Oh, and don't forget Grandma. She's on the team as well. Can Will and Amanda convince the New York teens that they're twins? Can they track down the bad guys before the ball drops in Times Square? Because if they fail, lives will be lost and the UN and the US may never be the same.
