1036717:::::The Witch in the Pumpkin Patch:::::In the words of 7-year-old Jessica Wakefield...Our class took a field trip to a pumpkin patch! Everyone had fun--everyone except me and my twin sister, Elizabeth. We think we saw a witch! Is the Sweet Valley pumpkin patch haunted? I'm going back to find out!
