19486429:::::Premonitions:::::TWO MILLION DOLLARS... It s the kind of score Karyn Ames has always dreamed of enough to set her crew up pretty well and, more important, enough to keep her safely stocked on a very rare, very expensive black market drug. Without it, Karyn hallucinates slices of the future until they totally overwhelm her, leaving her unable to distinguish the present from the mess of certainties and possibilities yet to come. The client behind the heist is Enoch Sobell, a notorious crime lord with a reputation for being ruthless and exacting and a purported practitioner of dark magic. Sobell is almost certainly condemned to Hell for a magically extended lifetime full of shady dealings. Once you re in business with him, there s no backing out. Karyn and her associates are used to the supernatural and the occult, but their target is more than just the usual family heirloom or cursed necklace. It s a piece of something larger. Something sinister. Karyn s crew, and even Sobell himself, are about to find out just how powerful it is and how powerful it may yet become.
