6341600:::::No Time to Wave Goodbye:::::New York Times bestselling author Jacquelyn Mitchard captured the heart of a nation with The Deep End of the Ocean , her celebrated debut novel about mother Beth Cappadora, a child kidnapped, a family in crisis. Now, in No Time to Wave Goodbye , the unforgettable Cappadoras are in peril once again, forced to confront an unimaginable evil. It has been twenty-two years since Beth Cappadora s three-year-old son Ben was abducted. By some miracle, he returned nine years later, and the family began to pick up the pieces of their lives. But their peace has always been fragile: Ben returned from the deep end as another child and has never felt entirely at ease with the family he was born into. Now the Cappadora children are grown: Ben is married with a baby girl, Kerry is studying to be an opera singer, and Vincent has emerged from his troubled adolescence as a fledgling filmmaker. The subject of Vincent s new documentary, No Time to Wave Goodbye, shakes Vincent s unsuspecting family to the core; it focuses on five families caught in the tortuous web of never knowing the fate of their abducted children. Though Beth tries to stave off the torrent of buried emotions, she is left wondering if she and her family are fated to relive the past forever. The film earns tremendous acclaim, but just as the Cappadoras are about to celebrate the culmination of Vincent s artistic success, what Beth fears the most occurs, and the Cappadoras are cast back into the past, revisiting the worst moment of their lives with only hours to find the truth that can save a life. High in a rugged California mountain range, their rescue becomes a desperate struggle for survival. No Time to Wave Goodbye is Jacquelyn Mitchard at her best, a spellbinding novel about family loyalty, and love pushed to the limits of endurance.
