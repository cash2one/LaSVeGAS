13244578:::::Untouchable:::::Picking a boyfriend can be murder, but for Annalisa Winslett, it might end up being the literal death of her. No one at Pensacola High School suspects the girl they know as Annalisa McKinnis to be a wealthy heiress in hiding, but things begin to unravel when two new guys enroll. Both guys are gorgeous, and both are trying to win her over. The only problem is that one of them has a million dollar contract to put a bullet in her. When her pure and innocent heart is offered to him, will this cold and empty hitman fall, or will he remain untouchable? This book is the beginning of a wild ride in a trilogy that will make you wonder if the power of love can truly conquer all. Book one builds the tension for the passion and erotic connection that blooms in book two (Unforgivable), and book three (Untraceable) brings you to the astonishing conclusion of the star-crossed lovers.
