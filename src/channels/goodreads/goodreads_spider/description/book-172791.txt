172791:::::House of Shadows:::::The Witch &amp; the Vampire... Rick Holt is a successful architect. Little does anyone one suspect, he learned his talents at the actual Bauhaus school of design in Germany, before it was closed in 1943 by the Nazi's. He's a vampire. Rowan Broom is plying her trade as fortune-teller in her corner of the Goth club when she discovers that the darkly handsome guy watching her from the bar possesses a literal heart of darkness. If that wasn't trouble enough, Rowan learns through her tarot that the entire club is in grave danger. Evil, in the form of a demonically possessed sorcerer has walked into the club and targeted the vampire as his victim of choice. The sorcerer intends to drain the vampire -- and use that power to kill everyone in the bar. Suddenly Rowan is embroiled in the bizarre task of rescuing a vampire. However, Rowan is not merely a fortune-teller. She is an experienced and potent witch whose source of power is sex - in its rawest and basest form. With the Goth bar in flames behind them, Witch meets Vampire face to face to discover that they have absolutely nothing in common - but unearthly desire. And this is only the Beginning...
