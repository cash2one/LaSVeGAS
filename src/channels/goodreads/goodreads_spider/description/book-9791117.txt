9791117:::::In Leah's Wake:::::A Story of Love, Loss, Connection, and Grace At the heart of the seemingly perfect Tyler family stands sixteen-year-old Leah. Her proud parents are happily married, successful professionals. Her adoring younger sister is wise and responsible beyond her years. And Leah herself is a talented athlete with a bright collegiate future. But living out her father s lost dreams, and living up to her sister s worshipful expectations, is no easy task for a teenager. And when temptation enters her life in the form of drugs, desire, and a dangerously exciting boy, Leah s world turns on a dime from idyllic to chaotic to nearly tragic. As Leah s conflicted emotions take their toll on those she loves turning them against each other and pushing them to destructive extremes In Leah s Wake powerfully explores one of fiction s most enduring themes: the struggle of teenagers coming of age, and coming to terms with the overwhelming feelings that rule them and the demanding world that challenges them. Terri Giuliano Long s skillfully styled and insightfully informed debut novel captures the intensely personal tragedies, victories, and revelations each new generation faces during those tumultuous transitional years. Recipient of multiple awards and honors, In Leah s Wake is a compelling and satisfying reading experience with important truths to share by a new author with the voice of a natural storyteller and an unfailingly keen understanding of the human condition at every age.
