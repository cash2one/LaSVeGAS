17194490:::::Tell Me It's Real:::::Do you believe in love at first sight? Paul Auster doesn't. Paul doesn't believe in much at all. He s thirty, slightly overweight, and his best features are his acerbic wit and the color commentary he provides as life passes him by. His closest friends are a two-legged dog named Wheels and a quasibipolar drag queen named Helena Handbasket. He works a dead-end job in a soul-sucking cubicle, and if his grandmother's homophobic parrot insults him one more time, Paul is going to wring its stupid neck. Enter Vince Taylor. Vince is everything Paul isn t: sexy, confident, and dumber than the proverbial box of rocks. And for some reason, Vince pursues Paul relentlessly. Vince must be messing with him, because there is no way Vince could want someone like Paul. But when Paul hits Vince with his car in a completely unintentional if-he-died-it'd-only-be-manslaughter kind of way he's forced to see Vince in a whole new light. The only thing stopping Paul from believing in Vince is himself and that is one obstacle Paul can t quite seem to overcome. But when tragedy strikes Vince's family, Paul must put aside any notions he has about himself and stand next to the man who thinks he's perfect the way he is.
