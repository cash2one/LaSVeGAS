He won the tragic prize at the City Dionysia thirteen times between ca. 499 &amp; 458, &amp; in his later years was probably victorious almost every time he put on a production, though Sophocles beat him at least once. Of his total of about 80 plays, seven survive complete. The 1st volume of this new Loeb Classical Library edition offers fresh texts &amp; translations by Alan H. Sommerstein of Persians, the only surviving Greek historical drama; Seven against Thebes , from a trilogy on the conflict between Oedipus' sons; Suppliants , on the successful appeal by the daughters of Danaus to the king &amp; people of Argos for protection against a forced marriage; &amp; Prometheus Bound (of disputed authenticity), on the terrible punishment of Prometheus for giving fire to humans in defiance of Zeus.
