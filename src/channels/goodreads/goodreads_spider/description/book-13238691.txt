13238691:::::A Haunted Love Story: The Ghosts of the Allen House:::::A Haunted Love Story: The Ghosts of the Allen House Book Description A Haunted Love Story is two tales in one: a modern family's attempt to embrace their strange, spiritinhabited home and a vintage love affair kept secret for six decades. When Mark Spencer bought the beautiful old Allen House in Monticello, Arkansas, he knew that it was famously haunted. According to ghost lore, the troubled spirit of Ladell Allen, who mysteriously commited suicide in the master bedroom in 1948, still roamed the historic mansion. Yet Mark remained skeptical--until he and his family began witnessing faceless phantoms, a doppelganger spirit, and other paranormal phenomena. Ensuing ghost investigations offered convincing evidence that six spirits, including Ladell, inhabited their home. But the most shocking event occured the day Mark followed a strange urge to explore the attic and found, crammed under a floorboard, secret love letters that touchingly depict Ladell Allen's forbidden, heart-searing romance--and shed light on her tragic end.
