29588825:::::If I Was Your Girl:::::My name is Amanda. I m 18. When you look at me, you might see that I m pretty and popular; you might think my life is easy. But being me has never been easy. Because I haven t always been Amanda. When I was born, I was named Andrew. Now, at my new school, I finally feel like myself. But do I owe my new friends the truth about my past?
