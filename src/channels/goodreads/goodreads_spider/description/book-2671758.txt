2671758:::::The Touch of Sage:::::Following the death of her parents, Sage Willows had lovingly nurtured her younger sisters through childhood. She loved her sisters. She d seen each one married, and was glad to see them settled and happy. Furthermore, she held no resentment at never having found a good man of her own to settle down with. Yet, regret is different than resentment and far more haunting. Still, Sage found as much joy as was allowed a lonely young woman in being proprietress of Willows Boardinghouse, and in the companionship of the four beloved widow-women boarding there. Until, that is, the devilishly handsome Rebel Lee Mitchell appeared. It seemed Reb Mitchel instantly and forever vanquished Sage s feigned contentment. Dark, mysterious and secretly wounded, Reb Mitchell utterly captured Sage s lonely heart. Nevertheless, to Sage Williows, the powerfully attractive cowboy admired and coveted by every female in his path seemed entirely unobtainable. How could a weathered, boardinghouse-proprietress resigned to spinsterhood, ever hope to hold the attention of such a man? And knowing she couldn t would Sage Willows simply sink deeper into the bleak loneliness she d secreted for so long?
