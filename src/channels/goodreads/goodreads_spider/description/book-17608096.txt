17608096:::::Obscured Darkness:::::In the second book of the series, fleeing for their lives, Nichole comes into contact with a long lost sister of Charley McAllister. You meet a crazed doctor who is out to control vampires as well as humans. The family is thrown into a huge battle with many other creatures. "It just wouldn't be our family if it wasn't complicated; it was a bit redundant when you have an entire town beating on your door demanding your death. Somethings we found just didn't change with each generation. In death life never slows down, demon hunters searching for us, recovering loved ones and fighting for the safety and love of others. It was a good thing none of us ever had any expectations of what we thought life should be like otherwise I hate to say some would be strongly disappointed while others rather proud. Despite the uncertainty and dangers our family faced we were still in love with the world around us. We found death never stopped our family, it only changed the way that everyone else saw us. We hoped at some point there might be a generation that accepts us where we don't have to hide who we truly are."
