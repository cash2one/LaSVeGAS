423245:::::The Novus:::::Makenna Grace Gold is just your average twelve-year-old girl, who just happens to have been recruited by three faeries to protect the future of the world. Makenna must now battle the forces of Evil who seek to destroy her baby twin brother and sister. The twins are a gift from above who will eventually lead our world into its next evolutionary age of hope and enlightenment. Evil will stop at nothing to destroy the babies. Makenna, along with three faeries and a wisecracking earthworm named Fluffy, are the only things that stand between the Earth's future and its utter destruction. Can Makenna, who admittedly is not even that good in gym class, follow in the footsteps of her predecessors, King Arthur and David of the Hebrews? Can a twelve-year-old girl who has never had a fight in her life succeed as the Defender of Defenders, the Protector of Protectors, The Virago?
