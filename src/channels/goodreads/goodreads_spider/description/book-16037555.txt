16037555:::::Can't Buy Me Love:::::The Beatles' first performance in the U.S. was a milestone in American pop culture and the beginning of the British Invasion. For many of the 73 million people tuned in to watch, it was a life-changing experience. In fact, there is an urban legend that says that in the hour they performed on that February night in 1964, not a major crime was committed in New York City. Or was there? Meet Sonny Carter, an aging bank robber just recently released from prison after a 25-year stretch for bank robbery. Unrepentant, Sonny is determined to finish what he started back in '39: knocking over New York City's prestigious Hudson National Bank and Trust Company. It's not gonna be easy, though. Banks are a whole lot tougher than they used to be, and the members of his old gang are just about ready for the retirement home. And if that wasn't enough, adding insult to injury is the fact that the stool pigeon responsible for Sonny's lengthy incarceration is now the president of the very bank he wants so desperately to hit. This time, however, Sonny has a plan that just might prove to be foolproof, thanks to two unlikely sources: a sexy bank employee with secrets and a shady past, and the four unsuspecting mop tops from Liverpool about to make their historic American debut on the Ed Sullivan Show. Can't Buy Me Love is a lighthearted suspense novel featuring four ex-cons who plan and execute a five-million-dollar heist. In one night, these partners in crime face conflict with New Jersey mobsters, unexpected love, loss, and bittersweet triumph during one of the most important eras in American Rock &amp; Roll history.
