21643924:::::The Arrival:::::On a world where sword and sorcery rule, a feud between two archaic families threatens to eradicate the oldest line of Kings. Only one thing can tip the balance, the return of the Elementals. In Wellington, New Zealand, four friends cast a love spell unaware that within each of them a dormant power waits. As the final words So mote it be ring from the lips of Kassandra, Catherine, Sian, and Laura, a bridge between realms is formed. The Arrival is a story of love, hope, despair, and above all, determination. Only through strength of spirit and mind can the four women hope to survive a war where they are the ultimate weapons AND the ultimate prize.
