17447588:::::Surviving Raine:::::As the captain of a schooner catering to the elite on the Caribbean Seas, Sebastian Stark does his best to avoid any human encounters. Interacting with people isn t his thing, and he prefers the company of a bottle of vodka, a shot glass, and maybe a whore. There s no doubt he s hiding from a checkered past, but he does well keeping everything to himself until the night his schooner capsizes, and he s stuck on a life raft with one of the passengers. Raine s young, she s cute, and Bastian would probably be into her if he wasn t suffering from alcohol withdrawal. As the days pass, DTs, starvation, and dehydration become the norm. Even the most closed person starts to open up when he thinks he s going to die, but when she realizes their traumatic pasts are connected, it s no longer the elements that have Bastian concerned. He has no idea how he s going to Survive Raine.
