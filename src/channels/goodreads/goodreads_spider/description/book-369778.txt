They have no idea that she used to be Elaine O'Hara, daughter of the notorious con man Big Jack O'Hara...or that she grew up moving from place to place, one step ahead of the law. But Laine's past has just caught up with her. Her long-lost uncle has visited her shop, leaving a cryptic warning before dying in the street, run down by a car. Soon afterward, Laine's home is ransacked. Now it's up to her, and an enigmatic stranger named Max Gannon, to find out who's chasing her, and why. The answer lies in a hidden fortune-a fortune that will change Laine's life. In Part Two, J.D. Robb takes us to New York City in 2059, and puts Lieutenant Eve Dallas on the case.
