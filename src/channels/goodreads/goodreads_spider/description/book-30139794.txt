30139794:::::Goddess of Passion:::::Mithra is different! she said regardless to Mithra s burning eyes. No girl has her magnificent olive bronze skin, beautiful honey eyes and She stood beside Mithra. And the sign of evil on her face! 752 BC, AUTUMN, KARALA, MANNA ASSYRIA border, where, the earth is rampageous and the sky is perplexed, amidst a magnificent blue-grey mountain, the armored Median warriors ride to battle beneath the banners of their king. The men shout, curse, and stab wildly; Medians have been hating Assyrians for years. Mithra, a beautiful, innocent girl is born among hate and love. Her mother is an Assyrian princess and her father a young great military leader from the Median army, a disproportionate but burning love that not been extinguished by their people s cold hate. Mithra s mother and father die at a same time but in different places, Father in the battle with Assyrians and Her mother birthing her, maybe the world doesn t dare impose this loss to them. Mithra s face and her stubbornness is exactly like her mother, so some people who loved the devil s stories, now have a good choice to hate: She s the devil s angel!! people say; this is the believe that she has grown up with, so she also believes that she is different from the others. The love comes to help her, but as if her fate doesn t accept love, and the hate rise up against the love one more time
