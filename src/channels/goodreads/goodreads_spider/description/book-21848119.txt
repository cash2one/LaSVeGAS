21848119:::::The Lake Dweller:::::Spencer Kane continues his chilling adventures, this time with a last-minute change of plans for spring break. With his Florida beach trip canceled, he agrees to help a friend, Cassie Vance, check out a home her family inherited from her uncle in southern Indiana. The generous notion to help clean up the property while Cassie's parents were in London, was met with shocking surprises. A lake dweller, fixated on Cassie before she arrived, wants possession of her and the house. The man spent time with her uncle, pretending to be his friend, before her uncle was forced to spend his last days in the hospital. A dispute on the will and property location kept the home available for the man to inhabit for months. Spencer and Cassie work together, at times separated unwillingly from each other, to rid the house of this man and secure it from all uninvited guests. A young boy, Daniel, who is among the lake dwellers, captures the hearts of Spencer and Cassie, and desperately needs their help to survive and to escape.
