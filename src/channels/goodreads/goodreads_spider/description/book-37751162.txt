Sent to Hades, she leaves behind two precious gems and the Golden Girdle, holder of mysteries and the gift of immortality for the rightful owner. In Elektra s absence, two fierce warriors rise. Teigra a lone wolf who has suffered a life of unspeakable brutality as a slave. Forced to earn her living as a cage fighter, she endures by way of her cunning wit, quick reflexes, and lethal striking abilities. As a hired assassin, loyal only to the highest bidder, a chance encounter with the Girdle reframes her destiny. Thea raised and trained as a Sondra. As elite warriors in the Amazon tribe, held in the highest esteem among their people, a Sondra s mission is to eliminate any outside threat. But a new directive takes shape when a seer repositions her path to find the Golden Girdle. The battle to recover the Girdle pits warrior against warrior. Both are unaware of each other s existence, until they are sent on a perilous quest with impossibly high stakes. In this cruel, bloody, and often erotic journey set deep in an ancient world of slavery, torture, and clashing kingdoms, our fated warriors fight for their core beliefs and survival. On opposite sides of a grand, savage battle, each woman is driven to dominate the other by a shared prophecy and an instinctual force to outlive and outlast. www.theamazonlegacy.com
