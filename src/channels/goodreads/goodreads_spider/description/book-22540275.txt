22540275:::::Have Courage, Be Kind: The Tale of Cinderella:::::Ella is different than most young women in the kingdom. She can quote any Shakespearean play. She befriends every animal she meets, including the scurrying mice living in the walls. She believes in the power of kindness, in changing customs that are not so kind. Ella has faced unspeakable tragedy and loss, and is at the mercy of her cruel stepfamily. And yet, Ella tries to keep a brave face, no matter how difficult this becomes. Kit has always been deemed a "dreamer." He values peace above all else. He's never understood the point of certain royal traditions and rituals. He'd rather spend time in his mother's garden than learn to fence or sit for a portrait. And as a prince, this has been somewhat problematic. This is a story about kindness and courage, about love lost and love found, about the power of names. This is the story of Cinderella.
