568047:::::The Birth of Tragedy/The Case of Wagner:::::The Birth of Tragedy (1872) was Nietzsche's 1st book. Its youthful faults were exposed by him in the brilliant 'Attempt at a Self-Criticism' which he added to the new edition of 1886. But the book, whatever its excesses, remains one of the most relevant statements on tragedy ever penned. It exploded the conception of Greek culture that was prevalent down thru the Victorian era. It sounded themes developed in the 20th century by classicists, existentialists, psychoanalysts &amp; others. The Case of Wagner (1888) was one his last books &amp; his wittiest. In attitude &amp; style it's diametrically opposed to The Birth of Tragedy. Both works transcend their ostensible subjects &amp; deal with art &amp; culture, as well as the problems of the modern age generally. Each book in itself gives us an inadequate idea of its author; together, they furnish a striking image of Nietzsche's thought. The distinguished new translations by Walter Kaufmann superbly reflect in English Nietzsche's idiom &amp; the vitality of his style. Kaufmann has also furnished running footnote commentaries, relevant passages from Nietzsche's correspondence, a bibliography, &amp;, for the 1st time in any edition, an extensive index to each book.
