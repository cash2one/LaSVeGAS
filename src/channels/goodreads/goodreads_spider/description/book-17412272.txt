Celeste is the girl who has traveled a long way to rescue him with her magic. Did the witch who took him as a boy curse his mind? Or is there another reason for the chaos caused by his blackouts? Around every corner lies an obstacle they must overcome before they can finally face the witch, and the demon she summoned to stop them.
