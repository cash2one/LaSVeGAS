10920:::::Cold Mountain:::::Cold Mountain is a novel about a soldier s perilous journey back to his beloved near the Civil War's end. At once a love story &amp; a harrowing account of one man s long walk home, Cold Mountain introduces a new talent in American literature. Based on local history &amp; family stories passed down by Frazier s great-great-grandfather, Cold Mountain is the tale of a wounded Confederate soldier, Inman, who walks away from the ravages of the war &amp; back home to his prewar sweetheart, Ada. His odyssey thru the devastated landscape of the soon-to-be-defeated South interweaves with Ada s struggle to revive her father s farm, with the help of an intrepid young drifter named Ruby. As their long-separated lives begin to converge at the close of the war, Inman &amp; Ada confront the vastly transformed world they ve been delivered. Frazier reveals insight into human relations with the land &amp; the dangers of solitude. He also shares with the great 19th century novelists a keen observation of a society undergoing change. Cold Mountain recreates a world gone by that speaks to our time.
