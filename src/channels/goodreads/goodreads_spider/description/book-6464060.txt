6464060:::::Never Learn Anything From History:::::A collection of historical comics by webcomics artist Kate Beaton. First pressing, limited to 1000. From publisher Topatoco.com: "When Kate Beaton was first asked to make a book, she said "ok, but I only have about five comics on my website, gimme a while." Now the time has come! This is a collection of comics made between late 2007 and early 2009. It is 68 pages of the ones she likes the best! It should be noted that younger self comics aren't there, but perhaps they will have a home all their own someday!"
