4172194:::::Calling Mr. Lonely Hearts:::::Growing up, Roxanne, Del, and Alice tested the limits of their friendship with cruel and often dangerous games - safe in the knowledge that they were bound together forever. Now, Alice's marriage is over, and her husband is having a child with another woman. Roxanne, an artist consumed by her work, is losing touch with her friends - and perhaps with reality. And Del is desperate to be a perfect wife and adoring stepmother, but her friends see that her careful fa ade is crumbling. The instrument of their destruction is the enigmatic Varick. He seems to be a lonely woman's dream come true, but as he seduces each of the women in turn, their lives become unrecognisable to them - and their souls, perhaps irretrievable.

For once upon a time, the three of them agreed to tell a lie - one that ruined a life ... And now they all must live with the consequences....
