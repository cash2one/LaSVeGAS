2454828:::::Life and Death of the Wicked Lady Skelton:::::Set in the dashing, roaring days of the wicked 1600's this is the story of the lovely, wanton Barbara Skelton, who craved excitement and adventure and embraces more satisfying than her dull bore of a husband could give her. So Barbara turned to highway robbery and with her lovely figure concealed in male attire, she became a terror to wealthy travellers, who saw only the muzzle of her pistol and the masked face behind it. But in that lonely countryside rode another 'gentleman of the road' who, one fateful night, was to discover Barbara's secret. Between these two outcasts there flared a fierce, brutal passion which gave Barbara the unhealthly excitment that her wanton nature craved. The pair took ever more dangerous risks until inevitably the finger of suspicion pointed at Barbara. Murder, unfaithfulness and betrayal followed and Barbara watched her accomplice die on the gallows, believing she was now safe herself. She was wrong. Fate had a stranger end in store for Barbara Skelton, and she was to pay her debt in full.
