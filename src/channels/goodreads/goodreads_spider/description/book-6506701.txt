Her temper flares and actions speak louder than words, causing an eruption of emotions and an aftermath of tension. For TIFFANY PRICE, life is good. She is finishing her master's degree in psychology and feels qualified to analyze the human psyche; she has three beautiful children; and once her long-time boyfriend (Marlon) finally pops the question, life will be great.

When her love for affection and attention writes a check her behind can't cash, will "Old Faithful" Marlon be there to pick up the pieces? Alexis and Tiffany embark on searches for their purposes in life amid the chaos they encounter along the way. Their parallel lives intersect to form a tale full of controversy, with familiar characters making surprising appearances and new characters leaving lasting impressions.
