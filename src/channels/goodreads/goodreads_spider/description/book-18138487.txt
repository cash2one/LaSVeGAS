18138487:::::Forever Your Heart:::::I m a journalist Adam Kincaid, BBC reporter, to be exact, so I m not going to bury the lead. I m about to see the woman I never got over. I know that because I ve been back in America for years now, and I still don t date American girls. My dad would say I ve come to my senses, sticking to my own British patrician kind, but that s crap. Mum, the psychologist, would more wisely say it s my unresolved issues around Nicki. My teenage years are long behind me, yet my guilt over her remains. So I ve avoided all things Nicki, though the irony is she s the one avoiding me. Maybe if we see each other, we can both move on. Could she ever forgive me? Can you forgive yourself when you hurt someone you love? But please, don t answer yet. I ve jumped ahead of the story, and as a reporter, I should give you more background to get to the root of it all. So let me tell you my story. Then you can be the judge. NOTE: While this is the third in the series, it can be read as a standalone book.
