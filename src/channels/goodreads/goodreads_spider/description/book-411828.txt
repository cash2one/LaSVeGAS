411828:::::A Banner Is Unfurled:::::Ezekiel Johnson feels like he is losing his family one by one. It is the 1820s, and years earlier, Ezekiel had fled his abusive stepfather and his loving, yet browbeaten mother promising he would never return. He vowed that when he had a family they would be bound together in freedom, happiness, and love. But now this strange, new Mormon religion seems to have captured the hearts of his wife and children in spite of the rumors that surround it and its supposed prophet, Joseph Smith. As wicked individuals and strong temptations seek to block his familys path to happiness, Ezekiel realizes that he must either allow them to join the Church and risk losing them, or tear them away from their newfound faith even if they end up hating him for it. From authors Marcie Gallacher and Kerri Robinson comes the emotional first volume in the epic series A Banner Is Unfurled, telling the remarkable story of a real family in Church history and the choices they must face. Full of drama and passion, this book is one you will want to share with your family, friends, and loved ones.
