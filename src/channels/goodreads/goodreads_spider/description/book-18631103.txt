18631103:::::Mr. Beautiful:::::I ve been remade four times in my life. It is a distinct feeling. Impossible to mistake. The very marked sensation of being unraveled and reknit into a new thing, a new person. It can be good or bad, helpful or harmful, but above all, it is unstoppable. I was remade when my parents died, went from a happy childhood, into navigating a very dark world, with endless responsibilities, surrounded by enemies, and despairingly alone. It happened again at the hands of a cowardly predator. I d become angrier with that one, more cynical, and it undoubtedly turned me into the kinky f**k I was today. The third happened swiftly. One day I looked up into a pair of pale blue eyes and saw the other half of my soul. Checkmate. I went from a completely controlled existence, a life where I made every decision with cold calculation, to a man overcome with feelings and emotions that were foreign but somehow wonderful. And all too soon after that cataclysmic change was this fourth one, this one where I begged a God I d never entertained to spare the life of a woman that I could not live without.
