20298340:::::F.M.L.::::::Miranda Gibson is fifteen, in high school, and believes in one thing: herself! Disenchanted by the immaturity of her peers, a total lack of role models, and a very annoying younger sister, she lives in her own world--and does everything her way--with the only person she needs: her best friend (and fellow witch), Debbie. Then she meets Gavin, the charismatic new rebel in town, and to her shock, he begins to turn her world upside down--in more ways than one! The two of them start to explore the realm of witchcraft together, and with Gavin's expert help, Miranda is actually able to master a couple of small spells: changing her hair color; bringing dead bugs and plants back to life; that sort of thing. But then, things start getting out of control. Gavin may be good with spells, but the closer Miranda gets to him, the more she discovers how unstable he really is. And when the lives of virtually everyone around her start to unravel, resulting in suicide attempts and some even more alarming behavior, Miranda will have to believe in herself more than ever to get the ones she cares about--not to mention herself--through it all.
