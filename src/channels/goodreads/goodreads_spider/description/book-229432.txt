229432:::::The Pickwick Papers:::::Few first novels have created as much popular excitement as The Pickwick Papers -a comic masterpiece that catapulted its 24-year-old author to immediate fame. Readers were captivated by the adventures of the poet Snodgrass, the lover Tupman, the sportsman Winkle &amp;, above all, by that quintessentially English Quixote, Mr Pickwick, &amp; his cockney Sancho Panza, Sam Weller. From the hallowed turf of Dingley Dell Cricket Club to the unholy fracas of the Eatanswill election, via the Fleet debtor s prison, characters &amp; incidents sprang to life from Dickens s pen, to form an enduringly popular work of ebullient humour &amp; literary invention.
