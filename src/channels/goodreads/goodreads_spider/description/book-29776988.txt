29776988:::::Stuffocation: Living More with Less:::::We're all stuffocated. We have more stuff than we could ever need - but it's bad for the planet and it's making us stressed. It might even be killing us. In this groundbreaking book, trend forecaster James Wallman finds that a rising number of people are turning away from all-you-can-get consumption, from the exec who's sold almost everything he owns, to the well-off family who moved to a remote mountain cabin. In Stuffocation, Wallman's solution is to focus less on possessions and more on experiences . It is a manifesto for a vital change in how you live - and it's the one book you won't be able to live without.
