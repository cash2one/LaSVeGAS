20823218:::::Auslander:::::"Conviction nurtures intolerance" A skinhead attack on a Turkish schoolboy links four protagonists: Dannaks, promoted to Oberkommissar, leaves Drugs to join Soko REX, a small unit that deals with racism and extremism. His first case is that of the schoolboy. But Dannaks has joined because the unit is often seconded to assist Homicide, most recently because a serial killer is on the loose in Hamburg hanging right-wingers. However, helping Homicide takes a backseat as Dannaks comes terms with his new duties and gets embroiled in a private police-corruption investigation that endangers his life. Craig, a British reporter, writing about racism in Germany, uses the schoolboy attack to exacerbate tensions between Left and Right, culminating in an open clash between the two in the centre of the city. Cenk, a Turkish youth, joins a gang with the noble idea of protecting the community against such attacks. But the gang takes on a life of its own and is promptly regarded as a terrorist cell. Karsten, a sado-masochist and celebrated neo-Nazi, finds himself at a crossroads.

He sees the growing infamy of the Turkish gang as a challenge to his own standing
