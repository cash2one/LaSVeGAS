24874510:::::Michael Hanson and the Desolate Woods:::::Michael Hanson s high school peers think he s weird, at least in part because of the golden armband that s been there since birth and grown as he grew. But he doesn t let it bother him. He s got two good friends, a loyal (if sometimes annoying) little sister, and two parents who love him. He s figured out he s adopted, but other than that, he doesn t think there s anything exceptional about him. He s wrong. Just before his fifteenth birthday, the symbol on his armband begins to glow, and Michael starts waking up floating over his bed. Little by little, through the guidance of the winged beings Ethan and Izra, he learns who he is a powerful immortal from the ancient bloodlines of Earth. Together with his sister and friends Trenton and Anya, Michael explores a fantastic world of magic and unseen dangers, where a rogue immortal whose plans for gaining power and wreaking havoc threaten total destruction. To fulfill his destiny and defeat Zaric, Michael will have to master his new powers and accept help from the unlikeliest of allies. If he fails, Michael s immortality won t outlast his adolescence.
