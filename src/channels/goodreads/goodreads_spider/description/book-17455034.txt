17455034:::::Sign of the Time:::::Same old story, you re walking along the beach and a frazzled old gypsy offers you three wishes. Happens to everyone, right? Only this time, they came true. Just wish I had asked for something a little less complicated, like a nice house or world peace. Instead I got a glimpse of the wiring beneath the board, a tantalizing vision of the true nature of reality, where mind really can rule over matter but paranoia can drag your worst nightmares kicking and screaming into reality. All I did was ask for a sign. But that sign would not be revealed to me wholesale, no, I had to earn it by solving the riddle that surrounded my wishes. A riddle as old as the ancient systems of the Occult, reflected in the Tarot and the glowing red digits of my alarm clock. A riddle that, once understood, would change everything. Forever. Drawing inspiration from actual events, this is the story of a young man's struggle to survive a dark underworld of crime whilst wrestling with the mysteries of the Universe. An artfully crafted synthesis of the authenticity and humour of Trainspotting and the puzzle solving epiphanies of The Da Vinci Code.
