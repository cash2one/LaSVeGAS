23587648:::::Once Upon an End Time:::::This is the way the world ends, with a band and a whimper. Like a tsunami barreling down on the shoreline of an unsuspecting beach, the Book of Revelation has come upon mankind. In the blink of an eye, the world is transformed into a living nightmare that even Freddie Kruger would want to wake up from. In this dreary, post apocalyptic future, Jim Tanker and his friends(the remnants of a forsaken world), are in a nonstop state of panic, thanks to a constant threat of death, world wide destruction, demon invasion and a bio attack. Like rats in a maze, the fallen faithful find each other and muddle through. Some will survive, some will fight back, others will perish, and still others will bow down to the devil's hate. They're fallen people, living under a fallen sky. And the sky fell hard and fast.
