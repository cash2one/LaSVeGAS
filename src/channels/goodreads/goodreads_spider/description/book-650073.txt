650073:::::Swallowing Grandma:::::Orphan Kat Millar seems doomed to waste her best years caring for her horribly ungrateful grandmother, Poll. But relatives Kat knows nothing about are moving in, intent on changing her life forever. I wrote Swallowing Grandma because I was again interested in the dynamic between a carer and the person receiving that care. The relationship between Kat and her troublesome charge is one of constant small power shifts; each woman believes she is the one in control, and the struggle for supremacy continues right up to the end of the novel.
