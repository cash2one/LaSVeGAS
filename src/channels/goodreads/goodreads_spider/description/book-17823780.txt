17823780:::::Diary of a Teenage Fairy Godmother:::::A Fairy Godmother is not some pixie in a pink tutu. She s a guardian and a warrior. Lilliana Skye is sent undercover to a Texas high school to save one of Cinderella s troubled descendants, but everything goes wrong. Jessica Harrison hates Lilliana. She doesn t believe in fairytale magic or happily-ever-afters. Jess is tough, angry, and so intelligent it s scary. If she ever did see a mythical fairy she would probably stomp it into oblivion with her army boots. Matters go from bad to worse when Jess s older brother meets Lilliana and falls hard for the new girl. And Lilliana can t keep her wayward heart in check. Jake is, well, just plain dangerous. Falling in love with a human is forbidden, not to mention deadly.
