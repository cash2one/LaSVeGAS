17075214:::::Changing Lanes:::::Abby Halladay has the perfect life. Or, rather, she will as long as everything goes exactly according to plan. Abby never leaves anything to chance not her job as a syndicated columnist, not her engagement to her fianc , Fred, and certainly not her impending wedding in Paris (New Jersey, that is). Unfortunately for Abby, even the best-laid plans often go awry like when Fred runs away to Paris (France, that is), her column is canned, and her dream home is diagnosed with termites. Forced to move back in with her parents and drive her dad s cab, Abby s perfect life has now officially become the perfect disaster. Then a funny thing happens. Slowly but surely, Abby begins letting go of her dreams of perfection. As she does, the messy, im perfect life she thought she never wanted starts to feel exactly like the one she needs. Poignant and heartfelt, Changing Lanes celebrates the unexpected joys of everyday life and the enduring promise of second chances.
