1228638:::::Turbulence:::::From award-winning author, Jan Mark, a compelling tale of how a family become unwittingly entangled in the turbulent lives of another. Clay delivers papers like the Wild West heroines she loves to watch on film with her Dad. Gran is more into B movie horror. It's a normal family of sorts - and then another 'normal' family moves into the street and things become decidedly weird. The Stranger Who Nearly destroyed My Life would be a good title for a film of what happened next...but would anyone dare to watch it?
