15818628:::::This is a Book:::::Demetri Martin is a Very Important Award-Winning Comedian, so spends a lot of his time travelling around, with a notebook, filling it with jokes and incredibly long palindromes (over 500-words long, in fact). The very best of those are collected here, from his acclaimed comic drawings and the world's worst comeback lines, to brilliant charts and graphs ( Incidence of Lung Cancer in Dragons , A Sad Clown/Happy Clown Venn Diagram ) and a bittersweet ghost love story. Add in hilarious pieces on The Deleted Scene from A Christmas Carol, A Cappella Group Freak Accidents and Frustrating Uses of Etc., and this is a Book you'll never want to put down.
