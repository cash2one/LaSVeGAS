7986569:::::Born to Run: A Hidden Tribe, The Ultra-runners, and the Greatest Race the World Has Never Seen:::::Born to Run is an epic adventure that begins with one simple question: Why does my foot hurt? In search of an answer, Christopher McDougall sets out to find Mexico's Tarahumara Indians, the world's greatest distance runners, who can go for hundreds of miles without rest while enjoying every minute of it. Running without trainers is now big news, but the Tarahumara have been doing it for centuries and reaping the benefits. McDougall tests the idea by taking us from cutting-edge Harvard science labs to the peaks and valleys where growing numbers of ultra-runners are pushing themselves to the limit. And he finds his own inner ultra-athlete when he pits himself against the tribe, who run virtually barefoot, iin a breath-taking fifty-mile race through Mexico's Copper Canyons. A thinking exploration of mankind's most ancient pursuit, Born to Run will make you realize that the secret to happiness could be right at your feet.
