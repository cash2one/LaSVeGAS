15707018:::::On a Wing and a Dare:::::In Tremeirchson, a barn leader s children are expected to follow their parents into the sky, becoming riders of the magnificent winged horses that are the medieval Welsh village s legacy. Neither Emma nor Davyd, however, want to follow that tradition. Sixteen-year-old Emma risks losing her family by following her heart. Eager to take her place in the air, she longs to ride a forbidden winged colt born in barn of her father s biggest rival. She also dreams of the rival s sons, not sure which she truly loves. Bold and exciting, Evan will someday lead his father s barn. Davyd is quieter, more dependable, with an ability to get things done. Her father disapproves of both boys and pushes her toward an ambitious newcomer. He also insists she ride the colt he s picked for her. Davyd, also sixteen, is plagued with a secret he is afraid of heights. Refusing to become a rider means public humiliation, his parents disappointment, and lifelong ridicule from his brother, Evan. He reluctantly prepares to join his family aloft in the Aerial Games that provide the entire village with its livelihood and tries desperately to think of an alternative. As Tremeirchson s barns prepare for the Rider Ceremony, winged horses suddenly start dying. Shocked, the adults hesitate, mired in tradition and politics. Is it a disease or poison? Accidental or purposeful? Someone must discover the answer and act before all the winged horses in the world are gone forever.
