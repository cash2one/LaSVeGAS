Restating the importance of organization, Getting Things Done also plays with prioritization, which will help to sort which tasks to do first. Organization is the key to everything, and this is especially adopted in the Western notion that once you get really organized, you will be able to be productive for 24 hours a day. Written by David Allen, a management consultant and executive coach, Getting Things Done really elaborates on how to attain maximum efficiency but still be able to relax later whenever the readers want to.
