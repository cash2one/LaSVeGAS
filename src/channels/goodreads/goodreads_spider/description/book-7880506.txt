7880506:::::My Life Undecided:::::PLEASE READ THIS! MY LIFE DEPENDS ON IT! Okay, maybe that was a bit melodramatic, but I m sorry, I m feeling a bit melodramatic at the moment. Here s the deal. My name is Brooklyn Pierce, I m fifteen years old, and I am decisionally challenged. Seriously, I can t remember the last good decision I made. I can remember plenty of crappy ones though. Including that party I threw when my parents were out of town that accidentally burned down a model home. Yeah, not my finest moment, for sure. But see, that s why I started a blog. To enlist readers to make my decisions for me. That s right. I gave up. Threw in the towel. I let someone else be the one to decide which book I read for English. Or whether or not I accepted an invitation to join the debate team from that cute-in-a-dorky-sort-of-way guy who gave me the Heimlich Maneuver in the cafeteria. (Note to self: Chew the melon before swallowing it.) I even let them decide who I dated! Well, it turns out there are some things in life you simply can t choose or have chosen for you like who you fall in love with. And now everything s more screwed up than ever. But don t take my word for it, read the book and decide for yourself. You ll laugh, you ll cry, you ll scream in frustration. Or maybe that s just me. After all, it s my life.
