Zo Sorensson is perfectly normal, except she's been told she's destined for great things. Zo 's the one female dragon shapeshifter of her kind. But Zo is at the bottom of the class when it comes to being Pyr and her powers are AWOL, so she's sent to a Pyr boot camp. Zo quickly realizes that she has to master her powers yesterday, because the Pyr are in danger and boot camp is a trap. The Mages want to eliminate all shifters and the Pyr are next in line-unless Zo and her friends can work together and save their own kind.
