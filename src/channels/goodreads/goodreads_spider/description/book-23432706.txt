The Vagabond Vicar is an unashamedly romantic historical novel you'll fall in love with. If you love Jane Austen and Georgette Heyer, can't get enough of Downton Abbey or Cranford, or just prefer old-fashioned boy-meets-girl stories, try reading Charlotte Brentwood. Sensuality level: sweet (only kissing) Please note, although there is some mention of religious subject matter due to the hero's occupation, this is not an "inspirational" novel.
