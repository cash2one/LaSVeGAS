5996555:::::A Werewolf for Christmas:::::Lone wolf Zed Ashton has a problem. Carrick destroyed his life, took away his position as pack alpha, and left him crippled. Now Carrick is back-on Christmas Eve-to finish the job he started. Forced out of his solitude, Zed turns to Kristin, the pretty waitress at the local diner for help. He doesn't know her, but he's attracted to her, powerfully, in a way that makes him think she might just be his mate. Kristin Havers has a secret crush on the mysterious Englishman who has moved to her small town in Maine. Though she wonders about the handsome loner with paint on his hands, she's sure he could never find her as fascinating as she does him. So, when Zed turns up at the diner on a lonely Christmas Eve in need of her help and comfort she gives it to him wholeheartedly, body and soul. Little does she know she's getting a werewolf for Christmas.
