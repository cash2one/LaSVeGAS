6434488:::::The Sweet Valley Cleanup Team:::::The Park Project Elizabeth and Jessica Wakefield love parks, plants, and anything green. So when they hear about the plan to clean up an empty city lot and turn it into a public garden, they're happy to help. Then they learn that Mr. Patman, a rich businessman, wants to build a parking garage on the lot. Only one person can change Mr. Patman's mind--his snobby son Bruce. Can Elizabeth and Jessica win Bruce over to their side? Or will Mr. Patman build a garage over the new garden?
