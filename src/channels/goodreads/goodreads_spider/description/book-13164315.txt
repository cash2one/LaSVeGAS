13164315:::::The Farrah Chronicles:::::The Farrah Chronicles," by Boston-based writer Christine L. Mahoney, follows 29-year-old Farrah as she retroactively chronicles her life at the behest of her court-appointed therapist, a homework assignment to be picked apart, held up to the light and scrutinized in each biweekly, 90-minute therapy session. . Did Farrah really kill her would-be baby brother with a pinata stick when she was three years old? . Did she really force Daddy to move from their family home in Dayton, Ohio to his childhood home in Boston, Massachusetts when she was only four? . Was it Dirk Davenport who eventually drove her to the brink? Or was it Tad? Or Johnny? Or Kyle? Or Jesus Christ Himself? Who the hell knows? Certainly not Farrah. With Genie's help and 64 weeks of intense therapy, the raggedy-ass pieces of Farrah's fractured life seem to fall together in a patchwork of memories, neuroses, desires and lies. Or is it just an illusion? Love, sex, Jesus hallucinations... "The Farrah Chronicles" has it all! And it's funny as hell!
