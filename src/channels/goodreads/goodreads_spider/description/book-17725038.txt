17725038:::::3PM: The Preacher, The Power, The Penis & Me:::::Author Cheron K. Griffin will delve deep into the ills that have affected women in the church for years. In her third published work, "3PM: The Preacher. The Power. The Penis &amp; Me," Griffin addresses the religious diseases spreading from pastoral infidelity and the misguided treatment given to female flocks of many congregations across the United States, specifically in African American congregations. Until now, there has been NO other publication that has dissected the emotional, psychological and physical issues facing today s American women of religion with such a no holds barred approach.
