6315242:::::No Greater Pleasure:::::From the national bestselling author of Pleasure and Purpose , a provocative new novel of a woman who lives to serve... It was at the request of Lord Gabriel Delessan that a handmaiden of the Order of Solace be delivered to his manor house. For young and ingenuous Tranquilla Caden, it would be her new position of service?devoted as she was to fulfilling every demand of her new master, to stimulating his mind, stirring his soul, and arousing his body. Yet something happens that Quilla never counted on: she was falling hopelessly, dangerously in love with the enigmatic?and very married?man she was required only to service.
