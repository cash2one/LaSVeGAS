25118424:::::The Lie:::::This was no accident Haunting, compelling, this psychological thriller will have you hooked. Perfect for fans of Gone Girl and Daughter. Best friends are there for each other through thick and thin. You trust them with your life. At least that s what Emma, Daisy, Leanne and Al think. But all that changes when they embark on a trip of a lifetime together. When they return home, only two of them are left alive and the group has been torn apart by lies and deception. Many years later, when the dust has settled and life has moved on, one girl receives a threatening letter. Someone knows the truth about what happened on that holiday and will stop at nothing to expose it The Lie felt to me like a Black Narcissus for the Facebook generation, a clever exploration of how petty jealousies and misunderstandings can unravel even the tightest of friendships. Claustrophobic, tense and thrilling, a thrill-ride of a novel that keeps you guessing. Elizabeth Haynes The Lie is absolutely brilliant The Beach, only darker, more thrilling and more tense. It s the story of a twisted, distorted friendship. It s a compelling, addictive and wonderfully written tale. Can t recommend it enough. Louise Douglas C.L Taylor delivers another compelling read that ll keep you turning pages way too late into the night. Warning: may cause drowsiness the following day. Tamar Cohen Tense, menacing and utterly addictive, The Lie is a superbly crafted thriller. I loved it! Miranda Dickinson A real page-turner, with two storylines: one of growing menace in the present, and a past narrative of a girls-only holiday that goes horrifically wrong. Creepy, horrifying and twisty. CL Taylor is extremely good at writing stories in which you have no idea which characters you can trust, and the result is intriguing and scary and extremely gripping.
