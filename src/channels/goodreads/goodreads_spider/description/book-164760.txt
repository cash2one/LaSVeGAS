164760:::::The Winter of Frankie Machine:::::The author of The Death and Life of Bobby Z. and The Power of the Dog now gives us a fierce and funny new novel and a blistering new take on the Mafia story. Frank Machianno is a late-middle-aged ex surf bum who runs a bait shack on the San Diego waterfront when he s not juggling any of his other three part-time jobs or trying to get a quick set in on his longboard. He s a stand-up businessman, a devoted father to his daughter, and a beloved fixture in the community. Frank s also a hit man. Specifically: a retired hit man. Back in the day, when he was one of the most feared members of the West Coast Mafia, he was known as Frankie Machine. Years ago Frank consigned his Mob ties to the past, which is where he wants them to stay. But a favor being called in now by the local boss is one Frank can t refuse, and soon he s sucked back into the treacherous currents of his former life. Someone from the past wants him dead. He has to figure out who, and why, and he has to do it fast. The problem is that the list of candidates is about the size of his local phone book and Frank s rapidly running out of time. And then things go really bad.
