4977673:::::Boob Tube:::::When Actress Gina Martin lands a role on a top daytime soap, she soon finds herself immersed in a glamorous world of hidden secrets and dangerous temptations. Will Gina survive the Hollywood machine, or will it consume her? Boob Tube introduces the reader to a cast of colorful characters and stories inspired by real events. As research for the novel, the authors conducted confidential, behind-the-scenes interviews with dozens of soap opera industry insiders (actors, agents, managers, hair &amp; makeup professionals, fan club managers, writers, etc.) who dished stories stranger than fiction. The authors wove their stories into Boob Tube, a novel that some fans have alternately described as fun, eye-opening or deeply disturbing. After reading Boob Tube, you might never view celebrity the same way again. About the authors: Lesleyann Coker is a former reporter for Soap Opera Weekly Magazine. She now writes the Entertainment Bytes column for Forbes.com, and also contributes to the Huffington Post. Mark Coker writes for the Huffington Post, is the founder of ebook distributor Smashwords, and is a former Silicon Valley publicist. This is their debut novel.
