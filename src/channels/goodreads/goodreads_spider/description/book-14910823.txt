14910823:::::Sealed with a Curse:::::Celia Wird and her three sisters are just like other twenty-something girls with one tiny exception: They're the products of a curse that backfired and gave each of them unique powers that make them, well, a little weird The Wird sisters are content to avoid the local vampires, werebeasts, and witches of the Lake Tahoe region until one of them blows up a vampire in self-defense. Everyone knows vampires aren't aggressive, and killing one is punishable by death. But soon more bloodlust-fueled attacks occur, and the community wonders if the vampires of Tahoe are plague-ridden. Celia reluctantly agrees to help Misha, the handsome leader of an infected vampire family. But Aric, the head of the werewolf pack determined to destroy Misha's family to keep the area safe, warns Celia to stay out of the fight. Caught between two hot alphas, Celia must find a way to please everyone, save everyone, and oh, yeah not lose her heart to the wrong guy or die a miserable death. Because now that the evil behind the plague knows who Celia is, he's coming for her and her sisters. This Wird girl has never had it so tough.
