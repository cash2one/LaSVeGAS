22388165:::::Becoming a Jett Girl:::::How did I start the Lafayette Club? Well, I m in the business of saving tarnished souls. I hand pick girls from the street who have no options left in life and give them an opportunity they can t possibly refuse. They come to work in the Lafayette Club which is full of EXQUISITE DEBAUCHERY, where influential men come to conduct business and lap dances are considered a fine art. The girls are trained, they are morphed, they are educated, they follow the rules of the club and they know to submit to me. They live by my motto, no relationships, no love, just sex. They are never touched, only by me, they are never completely naked, only with me, and their personas are entirely anonymous. The only person who knows who they truly are, is me, Jett Colby. If these girls were ever seen on the streets of New Orleans, you would never know they were a Jett Girl.
