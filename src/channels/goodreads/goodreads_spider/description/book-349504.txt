349504:::::Expecting Adam: A True Story of Birth, Rebirth, and Everyday Magic:::::The "slyly ironic, frequently hilarious"( Time ) memoir about angels, academics, and a boy named Adam... A national bestseller and an important reminder that life is what happens when you're making other plans. Put aside your expectations. This "rueful, riveting, piercingly funny" (Julia Cameron) book is written by a Harvard graduate--but it tells a story in which hearts trump brains every time. It's a tale about mothering a Down syndrome child that opts for sass over sap, and it's a book of heavenly visions and inexplicable phenomena that's as down-to-earth as anyone could ask for. This small masterpiece is Martha Beck's own story--of leaving behind the life of a stressed-out superachiever, opening herself to things she'd never dared consider, meeting her son for (maybe) the first time...and "unlearn[ing] virtually everything Harvard taught [her] about what is precious and what is garbage." "Beck [is] very funny, particularly about the most serious possible subjects--childbirth, angels and surviving at Harvard." -- New York Times Book Review "Immensely appealing...hooked me on the first page and propelled me right through visions and out-of-body experiences I would normally scoff at." -- Detroit Free Press "I challenge any reader not to be moved by it." -- Newsday "Brilliant." -- Minneapolis Star-Tribune
