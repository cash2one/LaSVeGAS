15821325:::::What Beauty:::::Minus Orth walks dogs for a living and sculpts for his life. He s ready to create a unique sculpture cycle Mythical Gods in Their Twilight. Meanwhile, he has a girlfriend, Belinda, who s itching to get married. His friend, Peter N, has reaped artistic success that s both inspirational and a thorn. He plays poker with a quartet of exiled aristocrats. And at Minus s art co-op, the residents live on the fringe of society. One day Minus crosses paths with Karen Kosek, best remembered as a culture critic of the 1960s. Karen dropped out of sight years ago. Now she dresses as a bag lady ragged clothes, a garbage smell, and bulging plastic bags she carries as if they hold the secrets to the good life. Minus orchestrates a tenuous relationship with Karen, and discovers in her a woman who has not been trampled underfoot, but is burrowed deeper in society s crust than anyone could imagine. Thus begins an odyssey in which Minus becomes obsessed with Karen s past and present, obsessed with creating his sculpture cycle, and with the role artists play in society s split personality. Do you have what it takes to make something beautiful? is a question that comes to the minds of many characters in this story. Their answers are hilarious, confused, self-delusional, virtuous, or simply truthful, because the people who create beauty are different from those who value beauty, and far afield from the powers able to help it flourish or destroy it.
