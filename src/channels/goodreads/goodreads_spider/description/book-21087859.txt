21087859:::::Verse for Ages:::::A selection of themed poems written throughout the lives of the 2 main authors. Also including some of their favourite classics and Internet poems. To enable easy reading, each section is clearly headed with a title page and vignette, most attractively drawn by Linda Koperski who also designed the cover. And within each themed section, the poems are varied by mood. This book was originally printed for the families and friends of the authors. But I have now published as a tribute to Colleen Thatcher (deceased)and as her legacy to all poets, artists and writers. I have now decided to sell this book for charity: namely for Sue Ryder, Duchess of Kent House, which is where Colleen died. All proceeds will go to them, because this is what Colleen would have wanted.
