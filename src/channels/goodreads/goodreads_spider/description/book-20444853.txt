20444853:::::The Black Chapel:::::What would you do if a sexy billionaire asked you to marry him just for his money? Scarlett hates her new job as a stripper, but she can t afford to quit or she ll lose her house and won t be able to afford to pay for her dad s chemo. One night, the handsome billionaire Michael Manning visits the club and shows interest in Samantha (Scarlett s stage name). Scarlett is immediately attracted to Michael, but she refuses to date anyone she meets at the club. On Sunday, Scarlett s friend drags her to church, and to her surprise, Scarlett meets Michael again. He doesn t realize she s Samantha from last night and asks her out. But Scarlett would never have guessed what he s about to propose on their first date. Michael needs to marry before his mother dies of cancer, or he ll lose his entire inheritance. He presents Scarlett with a deal where she ll receive half of the inheritance if she marries him within two weeks and divorces him after his mother dies. Scarlett agrees to the deal. But soon she develops feelings for Michael and they begin a steamy affair. Serious problems arise when Michael continues to show interest in Samantha, thinking he s keeping it a secret from Scarlett. And when Scarlett s pretend mother-in-law has her followed to work, Scarlett s secret could very well cost her the billion dollar deal and her relationship with Michael.
