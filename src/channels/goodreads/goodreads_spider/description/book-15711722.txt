15711722:::::The Judge:::::It's not uncommon in the late 1800's for arranged marriages to take place, but when Bethany's father tries to pay off a debt by giving her to a violent drunk, she knows her life is on the line and runs. Judge Higgins is the only person in town that has the power to protect her and offer her the safety she seeks, but that safety will come at a cost, one that virginal Bethany isn't sure she can handle. Having to choose between serving the judge and his many friends or certain death, Bethany is thrust into a world of pleasure unlike any she could imagine. But when her past comes calling, will the judge s power really be enough to keep her safe?
