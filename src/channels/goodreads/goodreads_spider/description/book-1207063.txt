1207063:::::Horsenapped!:::::Stevie, Carole, and Lisa are best friends and horse-crazy members of The Saddle Club. The three are looking forward to the combined-training event at Pine Hollow Stables, when all riders will compete in dressage, cross-country, and stadium jumping. It's a horse lover's dream! When snooty Veronica blames her bad performance on her horse, Garnet, and storms out of the ring, Carole follows, fearing Veronica's threat to give away her horse. But horse and rider have disappeared. Later, when Lisa finds a $10,000 ransom note in the stall, the possibility becomes all too clear: Garnet has been horsenapped! Who would have thought that The Saddle Club would ever feel sorry for Veronica? The girls resolve to catch the horsenappers and soon find themselves in a daring escape that puts all their horse-riding skills to the test.
