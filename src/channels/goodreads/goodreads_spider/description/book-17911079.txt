17911079:::::Brilliant Nightmare:::::Why can t I call you ' ebro moje?' You always liked it, Ruby. I used to like it, I said slowly, knowing very well that I was about to hurt him so that he couldn t hurt me ever again. I used to like it, because the person who called me that loved me. You re not that person. There were no instructions telling me what to do when you find the love of your previous life, but I knew I shouldn t fall for him again. Not again! Because he wasn t Petr anymore and I wasn t Lucie.
