17856000:::::The Night I danced with Rommel:::::May I have this dance, Hilde asked Field Marshal Rommel, opening the Grande Ball held in his honour. Did this dance save the life of Hilde s Polish friends? Hilde had come a long way since her dream of becoming a singer was shattered when her father made arrangements for her to work as a housekeeper in Berlin at the tender age of fourteen. Hilde s life is thrown into turmoil in Berlin during the late 1920 s early 1930 s. Having Polish friends meant it was becoming increasingly unsafe for her to stay there and she finds a new life in the Harz mountains. In Goslar, Hilde meets her husband, Karl, a young officer in the German Army. When he joins the 7th Panzer Brigade led by General Erwin Rommel at the beginning of World War II, Hilde is left to bring up their children in war-torn Germany. Hilde s story is based on facts and is told here by her youngest daughter, Elisabeth.
