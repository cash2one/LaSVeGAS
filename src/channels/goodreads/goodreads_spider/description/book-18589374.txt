18589374:::::The Unfortunates:::::He wants his father dead. He wants power. He wants control... ....And he'll use me to get it. Kade Sario was supposed to vicious and cruel. He was supposed to be a monster, to hurt and chastise me for the smallest things... but he didn't. I didn't understand it... until I found out what he really wanted from me. He wants to use me. He wants to hold me high above the lion's den and wait for the strongest lion to offer him something he can use... He won't hurt me and he won't take from me, but he keeps me close... So close I can smell him on my skin even when I'm alone. Growing up it was ingrained in me that I do whatever I can to please my Fortunate. It was ingrained in me that I be loyal and faithful, and that I love my Fortunate more than I love myself. I expected that I'd want to please him. I expected that I would be loyal and faithful, just like I was taught... But I didn't expect to fall in love with him. Time is running out. Things are changing, the balance of power is shifting and if I'm going to survive in this world, I need Master Kade on my side
