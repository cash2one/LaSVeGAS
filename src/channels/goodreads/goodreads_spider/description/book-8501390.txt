8501390:::::Softly and Tenderly:::::Maybe in the wide-open country she can learn to breathe again. Happily married and owner of two successful boutiques, Jade longs to begin a family with her husband, Max. But when she discovers that Max has an illegitimate son--who he wants her to help raise--Jade's life is turned upside down. She flees to her childhood home, a rambling Iowa farmhouse, with enough room to breathe. There-- while her mother's health grows fragile, and the tug of her first love grows stronger--Jade begins to question everything she thought she knew about family, love, and motherhood. In the wide-open landscape, Jade begins to see a future that doesn't rest on the power of her past, but in the goodness of God's tender mercies.
