18178772:::::The Bette Davis Club:::::From humor writer Jane Lotter, comes this laugh-out-loud first novel. The Bette Davis Club is the hilarious chronicle of fifty-something Margo Just, her dysfunctional Hollywood-film-industry family, and Margo's battle to deal with both her drinking and an unsuccessful love affair. There's also a runaway bride, a missing-but very valuable-screenplay, and a cross-country chase in a gorgeous 1955 red MG. Along the way, Margo begins to find that what she's really chasing is her heart's own truth. And none of what she discovers will be quite what she expected.
