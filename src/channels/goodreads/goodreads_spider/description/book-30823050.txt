30823050:::::Shore House Slumming:::::Working as an editor in Seattle, Dana Kline led a happy life. She had great friends, a career she adored, and her health couldn t be better. But everything about it was mundane and safe. EVERYTHING. No gamble would have made her change her ways, so life was going to change it for her. After an unexpected release from her job and then finding out that she would become practically homeless for the summer, Dana gathered her courage and found herself ready to try a new life in Florida.

After many stops along both coast lines Dana finds out that it s okay to let her hair down, meet new people, and try new escapades. Just as long as her sanity doesn t fly away with the seagulls.
