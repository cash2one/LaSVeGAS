Joey Boldt and Aiden "Kid" Cade meet as children and grow up together dreaming the dream of becoming rock stars. The difference between them and so many others is that they have the talent to do it. Joining them on their quest are Cecily DeLuca, a wayward child of abuse seeking an escape, and Natasha Olejnik, a Ukrainian immigrant who has her own demons to overcome. Talent, determination and sheer force of will bring the four friends to the top of the rock 'n' roll world - but they experience the pitfalls of too much, too soon. They find the dreams they once had are lost in a whirlwind of relentless touring, personal betrayal, misrepresentation, and substance abuse that nearly destroys them. Burning Down Rome is the story of a rock'n'roll dream that became a nightmare for four unconquerable souls who nearly lost it all: Themselves, each other, and their passion... And who then reclaimed their destinies, and blazed beyond what the world said they were allowed to do.
