1734176:::::Someplace to be Flying:::::'They're supposed to live on the edges of society - sort of a society unto themselves' At the beginning of the world there were only the animal people: Raven, guardian of the pot that contains all of life's mystical forces; the unpredictable crow girls; Coyote the trickster who cannot resist an urge to stir the pot...and a vast assortment of others. One wet August night, cab-driver Hank Walker witnesses Lily Carson being brutally attacked and goes to her rescue. The attacker shoots Hank, but in turn is dispatched by two punky teenage girls appearing out of nowhere. Just as suddenly, they vanish in a flutter of black wings. Asked why she was wandering the most dangerous streets in the city, Lily confesses that she was out 'looking for animal people'. Hank has already heard tales of these from his friend Jack Daw, an aging storyteller whose mysterious, lyrical accounts revolve around wild crow girls, foxes, raven and coyote... Also of cuckoos, the deadly enemies of the crow family. Now something has summoned the cuckoo, and the whole city is about to turn into a war zone.
