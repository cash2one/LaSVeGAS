983569:::::The Essential Groucho: Writings By, For, and about Groucho Marx:::::Groucho Marx may be the funniest man who ever lived. Here in one volume are the classics of Marxian mayhem: excerpts from the scripts of the immortal movies, passages from his books, his articles for magazines ranging from The New Yorker to the Saturday Evening Post , the choicest ad-libs and quips from his long-running game show, You Bet Your Life , and selected letters, including his classic correspondence with T. S. Eliot. It's all here-the finest and funniest work by this century's most influential comedian, that man of whom Woody Allen said, "He is simply unique in the same way Picasso and Stravinsky are, and I believe his outrageous, unsentimental disregard for order will be equally funny a thousand years from now. In addition to all this, he makes me laugh." In the words of Groucho Marx: One morning I shot an elephant in my pajamas. How he go in my pajamas I don't know. Time flies like an arrow. Fruit flies like a banana. Outside of a dog, a book is man's best friend. Inside of a dog, it's too dark to read.
