359251:::::Three Blind Mice and Other Stories:::::A blinding snowstorm--and a homicidal maniac--traps a small party of friends in an isolated estate. Out of this deceptively simple set-up, Agatha Christie fashioned one of her most ingenious puzzlers, which, in turn, would provide the basis for The Mousetrap, the longest-running play in history. From this classic title novella to the deliciously clever gems on its tail (solved to perfection by Hercule Poirot and Miss Jane Marple), this rare collection of murder most foul showcases the inimitable Christie at her inventive best, proving her reputation as "the champion deceiver of our time." ( The New York Times) Includes the stories Three Blind Mice Strange Jest The Tape-Measure Murder The Case of the Perfect Maid The Case of the Caretaker The Third Floor Flat The Adventure of Johnny Waverly Four-and-Twenty Blackbirds The Love Detectives
