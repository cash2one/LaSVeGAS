3048010:::::Metal Gear Solid:::::From original story and game by Hideo Kojima, skilled retired FOXHOUND agent Solid Snake returns to his expertise - neutralize an epic crisis. Six deadly FOXHOUND renegades control a nuclear disposal facility on Shadow Moses Island in the icy Aleutians. If their demands are not met, a powerful, top-secret weapon will be unleashed upon the world. The solo mission is to breach the heavily fortified base, rescue hostages, and destroy the superweapon. His only obstacles are brainwashed commandos, DNA-enhanced troops, and six extraordinarily able assassins. But nothing is as it seems - secrets, a hidden agenda, and revelation to Snake of secrets from his dark past that would shake any man to his core.
