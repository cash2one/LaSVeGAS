601219:::::Spartan:::::Herodotus tells us that not all of the three hundred Spartan warriors died at the hands of Xerxes, King of the Persians, in the battle of the Thermopylae: two were saved bringing a life-saving message back to the city. This is the saga of a Spartan family, torn apart by a cruel law that forces them to abandon one of their two sons--born lame--to the elements. The elder son, Brithos, is raised in the caste of the warriors, while the other, Talos, is spared a cruel death and is raised by a Helot shepherd, among the peasants. They live out their story in a world dominated by the clash between the Persian empire and the city-states of Greece--a ferocious, relentless conflict--until the voice of their blood and of human solidarity unites them in a thrilling, singular enterprise.
