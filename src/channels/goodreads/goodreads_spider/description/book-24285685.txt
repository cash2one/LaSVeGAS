24285685:::::Breaking Even:::::What happens when one neighbor pisses off the other? They end up in a brutal prank war, of course. But neither of them expects what happens when they can t break even. Rye Clanton I told myself a long time ago that I wouldn t couldn t fall in love. I ve seen what happens, the things they don t tell you in fairytales. But I never saw Brin Waters coming until she had thoroughly invaded my life. Until her, I never laughed, joked, or even knew how to have a good time. Until her, I just existed. If my secrets weren t so dark But they are. Brin Waters How the hell do you go from hating someone to loving them? I don t know, but Rye Clanton is good at it. However, he s a walking contradiction that I can t figure out, an enigma that has stumped me more times than I can count. But he s the first person that s ever made me feel alive free. How do you give something like that up? Is loving him worth the risk of being destroyed?
