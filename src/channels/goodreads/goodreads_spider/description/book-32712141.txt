32712141:::::Dear Life:::::Dear Life, It's New Years Eve and time for a resolution. Time for decision and self-discovery. After all, isn't that what starting over, in a new year, is all about? Forgiveness. Clean slates? Finding beauty in heartbreak and pain, and finding yourself along the way? We hope so. Because we've immersed in the anonymously published Dear Life program, designed to help us step outside of our comfort zones and start anew. Forced to face obstacles and relinquish our demons we'll come together--or fall apart-- to prove our existence: Hollyn: The perpetually hurt Daisy: The sheltered and na ve Jace: The athlete with a heart of gold Carter: The bitter and pained dreamer Win big or lose it all, we're at a crossroads in our lives; four strangers meeting in the middle. Do we have what it takes to use this one chance and start over? Or will we fall apart?
