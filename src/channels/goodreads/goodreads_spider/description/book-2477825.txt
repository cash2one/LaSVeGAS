2477825:::::The Ten Best Days of My Life:::::Twenty-nine-year-old Alexandra Dorenfield suddenly finds herself in heaven after an unfortunate encounter with a MINI Cooper. The seventh and highest level of heaven to be exact. Her dog, Peaches, is with her; she is reunited with her beloved grandparents; she has the wardrobe of a movie star; and she lives in the house of her dreams next door to a handsome guy. This is heaven! But there s a catch. Alex must prove she led a fulfilling existence by writing an essay on the ten best days of her life or she will be demoted to a lower level of heaven, where the clothes are last year s styles, the men aren t quite as handsome, and, worst of all, Peaches and her family won t be nearby. Witty and inspiring, this divine debut novel dares to ask a material girl and the rest of us what makes life precious.
