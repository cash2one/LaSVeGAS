10298443:::::The Last Season:::::With the honesty and insight that are his hallmarks, one of the most successful coaches in the history of basketball, nine-time NBA Champion coach Phil Jackson, offers his personal account of the extraordinary ride of the 2003-2004 Los Angeles Lakers. Though familiar with high-profile, high-pressure seasons and the coaching of gigantic personalities, nothing could have prepared Phil Jackson for the high-wire act of the Lakers' 2003-2004 season. In THE LAST SEASON, Jackson tells the inside story of the season that proved to be the final one for the Lakers dynasty, from the signing of the future Hall-of-Famers Karl Malone and Gary Payton and the bombshell news of the felony sexual-assault charges against Kobe Bryant to the NBA finals and the team's ultimate dismantling. Jackson discusses it all - juggling enormous egos, public feuds, injuries, contract disputes and chronic team dysfunction - with his trademark honesty and depth of insight.
