676362:::::Letters from Prison:::::Imprisoned much of his adult life for both his rebellious conduct and his scandalous writing, the Marquis de Sade remains, almost two centuries after his death, a fascinating figure, a true rebel with a cause, one who despite all attempts to suppress his works remains a vital and enduring influence. Here in one volume is a generous sample of his correspondence over a more than twenty-year period, from 1777, when he was first incarcerated in the Vincennes fortress near Paris, to 1789, when he was transferred from the Bastille, shortly before it was stormed at the outset of the French Revolution, to the Charenton Asylum, from which he was finally freed on April 2 -- Good Friday -- 1790. Impassioned, angry, querulous, plaintive, caustic, indignant, cajoling, pleading, self-justifying, bade gives vent in these letters to his profoundest thoughts and opinions of the moment: he flatters those from whom he seeks help or solace, vilifies those who have brought him low, offers often brilliant and always original insights about society, the body politic, and his fellow man -- and women. These beautifully crafted letters offer us a Sade without artifice or embellishment, adding to his often stereotyped image a new, more human dimension.
