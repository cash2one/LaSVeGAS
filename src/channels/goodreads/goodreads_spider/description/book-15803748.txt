15803748:::::Staff of Judea:::::T he Staff of Aaron...the sword of Joan of Arc. After decoding an ancient scroll-one that purports to pinpont the treasure of the Jewish Temple, lost for two thousand years-archaeologist Annja Creed agrees to lead the party to recover the find in Judea. It's a perilous desert journey through sandstorms and bandits, and complicated by mysterious sabotage within the group, to arrive at a long-forgotten fortress deep beneath a mountain. Only then does Annja discover that this archaeological expedition is really one man's quest for the mystical Staff of Aaron, one of the Bible's holiest and most powerful relics-a weapon they say can do incalculable harm in the hands of the wrong individual. She must try everything humanly possible to prevent the staff from being used for selfish purposes. Even if it puts her in the mightiest battle yet-sword against staff.
