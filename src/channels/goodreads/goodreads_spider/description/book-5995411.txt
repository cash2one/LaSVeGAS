5995411:::::A Special Place In Hell...Healing An Epidemic of Unhappy Women:::::Why are women so critical of themselves and so critical of each other? United and secure, we can create unwavering strength (and an abundance of good) for our world. But, sadly, our unhealthy fixations often prevent us from realizing both our tremendous influence and the happiness we are meant to experience. When we are unhappy, instead of living lives that are full and connected, we tend to make unhealthy choices that create literal hell: in our own lives, within our families, our workplaces and communities. Inside this book, you will find encouraging words on how to free yourself from the seven "emotional roles" that prevent women from being their best, healthy, connected selves. You are meant to be happy! So, choose to live a life of happiness because, inevitably, what you choose to create -or destroy- will be what you receive in return. Choose happiness!
