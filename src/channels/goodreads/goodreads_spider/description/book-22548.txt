22548:::::The Dark Tower and Other Stories:::::Of course, said Orfieu, the sort of time-travelling you read about in books time-travelling in the body is absolutely impossible. So begins The Dark Tower, a captivating novella that continues the adventures of Dr. Elwin Ransom after the events of Out of the Silent Plane t, the first novel is Lewis s Space Trilogy. In Orfieu s office at Cambridge University, five men gather to witness the breach of space-time through the chronoscope, a telescope that looks not just into another world, but into another time. Also included are "After Ten Years," Lewis s retelling of Menelaus s battle for Helen, "The Man Born Blind," the story of a man who after gaining sight for the first time in his life learns about the relative nature of reality, and three other short stories. A necessary anthology for fans of futuristic fiction, this collection cements Lewis s place in the science fiction canon. A superb storyteller. Anthony Burgess
