18226785:::::The End of Eve:::::At age 39, Ariel Gore has everything she s always wanted: a successful writing career, a long-term partnership, a beautiful if tiny home, a daughter in college and a son in preschool. But life s happy endings don t always last. If it s not one thing, after all, it s your mother. Her name is Eve. Her epic temper tantrums have already gotten her banned from three cab companies in Portland. And she s here to announce that she s dying. Pitifully, Ariel, she sighs. You re all I have. Ariel doesn t want to take care of her crazy dying mother, but she knows she will. It s the right thing to do, isn t it? And, anyway, how long could it go on? Don t worry, Eve says. If I m ever a burden, I ll just blow my brains out. Amidst the chaos of clowns and hospice workers, pie and too much whiskey, Ariel s own ten-year relationship begins to unravel. Darkly humorous and intimately human, The End of Eve redefines the meaning of family and everything we ve ever been taught to call love.
