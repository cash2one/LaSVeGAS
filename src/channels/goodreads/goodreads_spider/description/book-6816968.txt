6816968:::::We Are Not Alone:::::Brilliant but na ve country doctor David Newcome courts tragedy when he invites a stranger into his home. In the English factory town of Calderbury, few figures are as respected as the little doctor David Newcome. His talents as a surgeon attract more renown than anything else associated with the tiny village. Kind to a fault, Dr. Newcome sees no problem with housing Leni, a nineteen-year-old dancer from Germany adrift in England even over the objections of his strong-willed wife, Jessica. Soon Newcome s family is torn asunder as their country and the world outside are drawn into war. 'We Are Not Alone' is a poignant portrait of one family s trials and tribulations on the eve of the First World War.
