She seemed to contemplate most days, "Why me? Why do you hate me so daddy?" He'd belittle her about every little thing. The pain and anguish she felt as his only child had her day dreaming that one day he would treat her special. Cathy loves her father and tries to make him proud of her, but everything she tried, never seemed to work. Her shyness plays against her, and makes her a prisoner within her own mind. She feels nothing in her nonexistent life could be made any better. Until, she met him. Rodrigo Rod Coram lives the life that most men fantasize about. He's the owner of a fabulous club, The Orchid Lounge. He has great clients, great friends and the eyes of every woman around. One thing Rod didn't have was a woman to love. Rod's best friend Frank asked him for his help. He needed an extra groomsman for his cousin s wedding. That's when fate brings an unloved woman, and a man looking for love, together. New Love. Secrets. Regrets. Two people find each other, but their personal lives may keep them apart.
