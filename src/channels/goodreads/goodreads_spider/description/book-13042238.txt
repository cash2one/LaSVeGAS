13042238:::::Love is Fear:::::Love is Fear is the highly anticipated sequel to the Number One Fantasy Bestseller, Love is Darkness. After a lot of swearing and only a little nookie, Valerie Dearborn has decided to make a change. No more lusting after Lucas, the hot, but emotionless, vampire king who can t commit. Instead she s going to make it work with Jack. After all, not only is he breathing, but he s the love of her life .Isn t he? Valerie is an Empath, with supernatural abilities that seem to do nothing more than give her the hots for Lucas. Once upon a time, Empath s had a purpose. They were ambassadors to the Others Fey, Witches, Werewolves and Vampires. They could settle the emotions of a Werewolf and make Vampires feel again. But that was long ago. Lucas isn t about to let Valerie go. He needs her to help him find the Fey, last seen in the Colony of Roanoke, North Carolina, circa 1587. He still believes they are the key to restoring balance to the world and the only way to keep vampires under control. They won t trust him, but they will trust Val. Between Jack, Lucas and Rachel, Val knows life won t be dull. Nor will it be the normal, 2.5 kids kind of life she s always wanted. As their enemies close in, Val must ask herself what life is really about trust, duty or mind-blowing orgasms? And even if she finds the answer, she may not live long enough to enjoy it. Please note this novel is not YA and has lots of sass, swearing and sex. Not necessarily in that order.
