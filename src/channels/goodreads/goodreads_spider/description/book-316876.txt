316876:::::The Chronicles of Amber:::::Amber is the one real world, casting infinite reflections of itself - shadow worlds, which can be manipulated by those of royal Amberite blood. But the royal family is torn apart by jealousies and suspicion; the disappearance of the patriarch Oberon has intensified the internal conflict by leaving the throne apparently for grabs; and amnesia has robbed Corwin, Crown Prince of Amber his memory - even the fact that he is rightful heir to the throne. The Chronicles of Amber is Zelazny's finest fantasy, a grand imaginative vision of alternate worlds, magic, swordplay, and murderous rivalries. 1. Nine Princes in Amber 1-156 2. The Guns of Avalon 157-338 3. Sign of the Unicorn 338-490 4. The Hand of Oberon 491-640 5. The Courts of Chaos 641-772
