Filled with many of the themes and concerns central to his great novels, these short works display the full range of Dostoevsky s genius. The centerpiece of this collection, the short novel The Eternal Husband, describes the almost surreal meeting of a cuckolded widower and his dead wife s lover. Dostoevsky s dark brilliance and satiric vision infuse the other four tales with all-too-human characters, including a government official who shows up uninvited at an underling s wedding to prove his humanity; a self-deceiving narrator who struggles futilely to understand his wife s suicide; and a hack writer who attends a funeral and ends up talking with the dead. The Eternal Husband and Other Stories is sterling Dostoevsky a collection of emotional power and uncompromising insight into the human condition.
