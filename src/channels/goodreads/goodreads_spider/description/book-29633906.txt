29633906:::::I Find That Offensive!:::::When you hear that now ubiquitous phrase "I find that offensive," you know you're being told to shut up.

Claire Fox is a British libertarian writer. She is the founder of the Institute of Ideas think tank and a broadcaster and social commentator, appearing regularly on BBC television and radio.
