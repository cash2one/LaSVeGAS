503156:::::A Midsummer Tempest:::::"What if Shakespeare were a historian &amp; his world a mortal one of men &amp; elves? Somewhere, spinning thru another universe is a history almost like ours except for the result of a revolution or two &amp; the earlier incidence of a few inventions. A prince called Hamlet has lived in Denmark. The English woods are full of Pucks, Titanias &amp; Oberons. Cromwell is at the throat of King Charles, but locomotives rage thru the verdant countryside &amp; observation balloons tower over battle lines."
