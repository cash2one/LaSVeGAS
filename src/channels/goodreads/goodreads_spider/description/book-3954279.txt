3954279:::::Models Don't Eat Chocolate Cookies:::::Walk the runway for all the world to see? Nope. No way. NEVER. At least, that's what I thought until Aunt Doreen secretly entered me in the Miss HuskyPeach pageant for plus-sized girls. I couldn't do it, but I felt too guilty to quit. There was only one way out... This is the story of thirteen-year-old Celeste Harris, who used to be perfectly comfortable with her weight. She also used to think nothing would make eighth grade worse than super-popular, super-mean Lively Carson's persistent insults and attempts to steal her best friend. But along came the chance of being crowned a chubby teen queen, and suddenly it was clear: Things could be much worse. So Celeste crafts a plan she'll sacrifice her chocolate cookie obsession, lose weight, and shrink right out of the competition. What follows is a series of escapades both hilarious and horrifying, as our heroine tries to hold her head high both on the catwalk and off and learns to show the world who she is from the inside out.
