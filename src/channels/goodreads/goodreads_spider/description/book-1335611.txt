1335611:::::Tree and Leaf:::::Repackaged to feature Tolkien's own painting of the Tree of Amalion, this collection includes his famous essay, 'On Fairy-Stories' and the story that exemplifies this, 'Leaf by Niggle'. Fairy-stories are not just for children, as anyone who has read Tolkien will know. In his essay 'On Fairy-Stories', Tolkien discusses the nature of fairy-tales and fantasy and rescues the genre from those who would relegate it to juvenilia. The haunting short story, 'Leaf by Niggle', recounts the story of the artist, Niggle, who has "a long journey to make" and is seen as an allegory of Tolkien's life. Tree and Leaf is an eclectic, amusing, provocative and entertaining collection of works which reveals the diversity of J.R.R.Tolkien's imagination, the depth of his knowledge of English history, and the breadth of his talent as a creator of fantastic fiction.
