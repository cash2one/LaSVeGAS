17343329:::::Fighting Out of New Milford, USA:::::Sequel to Fighting Out of Mobberley, England The three main characters to survive the fake zombie apocalypse in the extraordinary Fighting Out Of Mobberley, England, are enticed to do it all again, this time in an Old West fort in Texas. They and twelve other varied characters are to spend six months besieged by robotic zombies. Transported to the location on a Wild West train, kitted out in cowboy and cowgirl outfits, armed with original Colt pistols and Winchester rifles, they must get along as best they can as winter sets in. But there are some players in the fort with ulterior motives for taking part, and it soon threatens to descend into anarchy once again.
