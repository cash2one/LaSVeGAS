15843083:::::Supersymmetry and Beyond: From the Higgs Boson to the New Physics:::::In Supersymmetry and Beyond , renowned physicist Gordon Kane tells the epic story of the quest to uncover a fully unified theory of physics. He introduces the theory of supersymmetry, which implies that each of the fundamental particles has a "superpartner" that can be detected at energies and intensities only now being achieved in the giant accelerators. If the theory is correct, these superpartners will also help solve many of the puzzles of modern physics such as the existence of the Higgs boson as well as one of the biggest mysteries in cosmology: the notorious "dark matter" of the universe. An absorbing narrative of science in the making, Supersymmetry and Beyond , now fully updated to reflect recent discoveries at the Large Hadron Collider, offers a glimpse of the cutting edge in one of the most exciting scientific ventures of our times.
