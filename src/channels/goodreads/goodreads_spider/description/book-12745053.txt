The Sun is now friends with Earth and 7 other planets Pluto: Not cool. What if Facebook had emerged with the Big Bang, and every historical event took place online? Imagine how we d we see history if . . . On April 15, 1865, Abraham Lincoln updated his status: "Taking the missus to the theater" God and Stephen Hawking trolled each other in a comment war over the creation of the universe? Alexander the Great "checked into" all the countries he conquered Irreverent and clever, The History of the World According to Facebook goes back through time, from the beginning of the world to the present, to cover all the major events and eras of human history, such as the Renaissance, the Industrial Revolution, and the Information Age. Wylie Overstreet brings the book up to date with three-dozen pages of additional material on contemporary figures and topics, from Caitlin Jenner to Deflategate to MAGA and Trump. Filled with hundreds of actual figures from across the centuries and thousands of invented statuses, comments, and actions lampooning Facebook users penchant for oversharing, abbreviation, self-importance, and lazy jargon, The History of the World According to Facebook defies all attempts at taking the multi-billion user social media platform SRSLY. It is the funniest parody of history and the dawn of man since, well, the dawn of man.
