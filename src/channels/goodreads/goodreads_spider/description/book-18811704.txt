18811704:::::The First Christmas Carol:::::Matthew, Mark, Luke, and . . . Dickens? In an interpretive retelling of this familiar Christmas story the author asks: What if there was room at the inn? The First Christmas Carol combines a timeless work of classic literature with the first documented Christmas story. As darkness cloaks the hills of Bethlehem three angels visit an unscrupulous innkeeper, revealing his past, present, and the miracles yet to come. Not the story you've read. Still the stories you know.
