1658691:::::Wagon Trail:::::The Saddle Club is heading west on the Oregon Trail. They are taking part in a recreation of the famous wagon train ride across the American West. Things may be a little easier for these modern-day pioneers, but they still have their fair share of problems to face. Stevie has to drive their wagon--and wear a dress! She isn't sure which is worse. Lisa, meanwhile, has to contend with a reluctant cow who really doesn't want to walk across the prairie. Even Carole is finding those long days in the saddle a little more than she bargained for.
