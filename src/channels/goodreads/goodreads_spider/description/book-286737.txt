286737:::::The Children of First Man:::::"MASTERFULLY RESEARCHED AND WRITTEN, THE CHILDREN OF FIRST MAN IS A FEAST OF A NOVEL. James Alexander Thom's sweeping saga of Welsh colonization in prehistoric America is loaded with wonderful characters and events, some so poignant I had to stop reading now and then to reflect." --Linda Lay Shuler Author of She Who Remembers With its beautifully written and deeply felt descriptions of the feelings the first white settlers and Native Americans had for each other, THE CHILDREN OF FIRST MAN tells the fascinating story of a European people gradually absorbed into the Amerindian culture until their literacy was lost and their Christian religion submerged in the legend of a Welsh Prince named Madoc, the First Man. Sweeping from the blood-soaked castles of medieval Wales to the landmark expedition of Lewis and Clark, from the hushed beauty of virgin wilderness to Mandan villages of domed earthen lodges, THE CHILDREN OF FIRST MAN is a triumph of the storyteller's art. "TERRIFICALLY ENTERTAINING...A highly imaginative novel that combines an old legend with historical fact to create an epic tale of America starting some three-hundred years before Columbus arrived." --Booklist
