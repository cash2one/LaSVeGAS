30720705:::::Saving the Future: Economic Development & Prosperity:::::Saving the Future is an urgent wake-up call to a new generation of leaders to rise to the historic challenge to save Nigeria and to retreat from the wasteful, destructive trajectory we have stumbled along over the decades. It is filled with golden nuggets of insights from the world of business, high finance and economic science. It diagnoses Nigeria's manifold national maladies as: corruption, waste, poor governance, failure of the rule of law, the infrastructure deficit, weak property rights and the poor business environment. The author demonstrates an uncommon understanding of world economics and the structural parameters of 21st century integrated digital industrial civilization. He strongly believes that if the right things are done to put the house in order, the future of Nigeria can still be saved.
