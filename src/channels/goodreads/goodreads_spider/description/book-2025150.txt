2025150:::::Ramona's World:::::To the delight of Ramona Quimby readers everywhere, Newbery Medal-winning author Beverly Cleary has just made Ramona's world a little bit bigger. As she starts the fourth grade, Ramona believes that this year will be "the best year of her life, so far." She can show off her calluses from swinging on the rings in the park; the boy she calls Yard Ape sits across the aisle from her; her teacher praises her writing; and she has a new baby sister, Roberta. But best of all, she has a new best friend, Daisy. Little does Ramona know the challenges her fourth-grade year holds in store. Not only must she improve her rotten spelling, but she must also be a good role model for baby Roberta. And her mother wants her to spend more time with the awful Susan. Life isn't easy, especially when she is surrounded by perfect spellers and everyone praises her big sister, Beezus, for being responsible. Sometimes Ramona fails, often with hilarious results. But with the support of family and friends, she discovers something reassuring -- that being imperfect can be perfectly fine. 01 AZ Young Reader Award Masterlist (Intermed. cat.), 01 Colorado Children's Book Award (Jr. Novel Cat.), 00-01 Young Reader's Choice Award Program Masterlist, and 00-01 Keystone to Reading Book Award Masterlist 00 Children's Choices (IRA/CBC)
