18184923:::::The Beauty and Glory of the Father:::::The essays in The Beauty and Glory of the Father call us to stand in wonder of the First Person of the Trinity. Through an assortment of studies, readers are challenged to recognize the Father's glory displayed in His Son, to adore His beautiful attributes, to know Him as a Savior, and to rest in His loving hands. This book, along with The Beauty and Glory of Christ and The Beauty and Glory of the Holy Spirit, reinforces the ongoing necessity of cultivating a Trinitarian piety. Contributors include Joel Beeke, Bart Elshout, Jerry Bilkes, Ryan McGraw, David Murray, Burk Parsons, Paul Smalley, Derek Thomas, and William VanDoodewaard. "Rarely has a book been written on the beauty and glory of God the Father. This is a collection of the messages given at Puritan Seminary's theology conference in August 2012. Unlike many anthologies, this one is a jewel. You will find a number of topics here not normally expounded in our times. I am sure you will profit from reading this book."
