31362199:::::Billionaire Romance: Music in His soul:::::Nate is the one brother who has absolutely no talent in the music department and he is quite content with his life which is going according to plan and did not think he would ever be interested in a woman who has absolutely no control over her life and business. Anne is a charming single mom running her own small pizzeria. She is exactly that disastrous type lost among due tax reports; a 4-year-old kid running and messing everything in the kitchen and spilling flour on the customers; last but not least - personal finances never making the ends meet. Nate believes he can cope with a kid and a business that is seemingly on the verge of collapse. What he for sure will not handle is finding out his woman is also into music. He d prefer to see a legion of men in Anne s bedroom instead of that old acoustic guitar. Will he be selfish enough to break her dreams for the sake of his own personal happiness or will he find the courage to support her and maybe find that there is music in his soul?
