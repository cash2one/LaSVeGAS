22174149:::::Earth Sentinels: The Storm Creators:::::Compelling adventure." -- Dr. Margaret Flowers, Co-director of Popular Resistance and Co-chair of the Green Party Intriguing blue doors and ethereal mists beckon people who are tragically impacted by mankind s greed, corruption and indifference, such as Zachary, a young man whose family s organic farm is ruined by fracking; Haruto, a Miko living in Fukushima, Japan, where the nuclear meltdown is raging out of control; Mahakanta, a cotton farmer in India, who used GMO seeds with devastating results; Amazonian tribe members, Pahtia and his daughter Conchita, who are fighting against intruders illegally tearing down their rainforest; and the Bear Claw First Nation Tribe that is dealing with an unstoppable oil spill on their traditional hunting grounds. After stepping into another dimension, all of them come face to face with the mastermind Bechard, a fallen angel who just happens to be the Master of the Elements. Together, they use supernatural powers to grab the world s attention, demanding that the world s leaders implement the changes...or else. But as the events unfold and governments retaliate, the characters are forced to question their motives, fight for their lives and listen to their hearts. Quick paced with a powerful message.
