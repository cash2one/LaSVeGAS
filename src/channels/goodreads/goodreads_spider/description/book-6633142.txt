6633142:::::Selena Gomez:::::Editorial Reviews "Selena's Secrets Revealed," part of the "All Access" series promises a lot, but there are no scandals or even secrets in this breezily written fan biography for preteens. Selena turns out to be a lovely, even-tempered, talented girl whose career is taking off. Since her mother did some acting, Selena always knew she wanted to be an actor and had the amazing luck to be chosen for Barney &amp; Friends when she was seven; studying acting, singing, and dance, she worked in commercials, films, and several pilots for kids' shows. As her fans will know, Selena's biggest break came when she was spotted by Disney Studios and started on the road to stardom. Best known for her role in Wizards of Waverly Place on the Disney Channel, she has moved on to made-for-TV movies, singing, recording, and even producing. Selena tells her fans much of the book consists of quotes from various interviews she has given all about her family's Mexican heritage, her many friends (boy and girl), her love of surfing, and her outlook on fashion (Converse sneakers are big); admirers will be glad to know that Selena donates time and money to charity, too. For serious Selena fans, the 140 pages will fly by; others may find them a bit tedious with much repetition and preteen jargon, not to mention the tons of exclamation points. But the dedicated will probably find this little book and its color photos "cool," "extra cool," "incredibly cool," and even "crazy cool!" Reviewer: Barbara L. Talcroft
