After picking out the pattern and the fabric, Priscilla is ready for sharing fellowship with the other Amish women in her community. Unfortunately, the attention that she receives warrants more jealousy and bullying from another young woman. For the second time, Priscilla has to determine how to deal with the fallout from bullying by Susie Byler. Will it drive a wedge between Priscilla and the community or, even worse, Stephen Esh? This Amish novella is a perfect read for young adults and adult readers who love Amish or Christian fiction. Includes discussion questions for book clubs or just private reflection.
