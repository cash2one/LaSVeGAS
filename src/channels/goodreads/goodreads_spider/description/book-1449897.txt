1449897:::::Desperado's Gold:::::Jilted at the altar and stranded in the Arizona desert by a blown gasket in her Mustang convertible, Catalina Lane hoped for a tow truck and a lift to the nearest gas station. She certainly didn't expect a real, live desperado, swathed in black, to appear and carry her off into the sunset. But suddenly, catapulted back in time to the days of the Old West, Catalina was transported into a world of blazing six-guns and ladies of the evening. What could she do but go along for the ride? When Jackson Cady, the infamous gunslinger known as "Kid Creede," returned to Baxter, it was to kill a man and earn a reward, not to use his gold to rescue a na ve librarian from the clutches of a greedy madam. He never would have dreamed that the beauty who babbled so incoherently about the twentieth century would have such an impact on him. But the longer he spent with her, the more he found himself captivated by her tender touch and luscious body --- and when he looked deep into her amber eyes, he knew that the passion that smoldered between them was a treasure more precious than any . . . . DESPERADO'S GOLD
