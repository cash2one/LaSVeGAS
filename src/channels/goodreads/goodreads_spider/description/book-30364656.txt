30364656:::::Love To Hate:::::Cyrus Angelus is the always the new kid, the outsider, the freak, and he has no reason to expect things will change at his new boarding school. But perhaps that's because he didn't expect to meet Hayden, his fun, popular roommate who's hell bent on breaking Cyrus' icy exterior. Cyrus has spent the majority of his life going from boarding school to boarding school, all but ignored by his aloof single mother and forced to find his way on his own. Used to being alone, Cyrus turned quiet and cynical, burying himself in academics and art. In his senior year, Cyrus has chosen to try something new; rather than trying to make friends, Cyrus has made his peace with being alone and aims to stay unattached. But to his surprise, his new roommate doesn t seem put off by Cyrus s attempts to discourage friendship. Instead, he goes to great lengths to do the exact opposite. Hayden is everything that Cyrus isn t; he s charismatic, funny, and popular, but he, like Cyrus, is hiding something from his friends. While Cyrus is terrified that his new life at Sharpe s Boarding School will leave him as hurt as every previous year, Hayden is equally worried that his true identity as the school s orphan charity case or his homosexuality will tear down the life he has built.
