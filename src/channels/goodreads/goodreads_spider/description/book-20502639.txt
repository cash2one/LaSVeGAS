20502639:::::Why I Don't Want To Write This Book:::::Why I Don t Want to Write This Book :D Do something different. Many teens spend summer after summer having fun doing nothing. Summer is a great time for teens to write a quick book and publish it, and make it available internationally. That s what Josephine decided for her granddaughter this summer (2011). This book is about a lively teen girl who goes on a summer vacation to visits her grandparents and how she wanted to do anything but write a book. Readers will feel validated to: Give serious thought about writing their own book Think of how they spent their summer Plan next summer even better Grow into their own person Go after their dreams Dream big, work hard, and expect abundance! Asia and Josephine makes teens feel valued as a person with wonderful ideas, or feel that his or her ideas or opinions are worthwhile in the simplest way, because they are. No matter, how much teens ideas may make no sense to you they both know that teens must be free to try them, and learn from them. Do not worry during the process of them becoming a skillful adult there are times of frustration as well as laughter, and unspoken surprises and rewards. Asia has hope for teens, because she is a teen (13), herself with misunderstood ideas, including all night (included in the book: Face book, Video Calls, Texting ) activities. Josephine hasn t forgotten that not long ago she was once a teen (of the Groovy, Miniskirts, Afro, Hitch-Hike ) 60 s with great ideas and not so great ideas. You are going to enjoy this book. Includes: Space for your to record your youthful personal journal.
