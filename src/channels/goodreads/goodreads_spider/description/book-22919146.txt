22919146:::::The Soul and the Seed:::::Aranka is a moderately normal teenager until those who hold true power in today's world decide she's a threat. The accepted image of the modern world is an illusion. A clandestine force usurps the desires and emotions of individuals, and those who won't conform must be crushed to preserve the appearance of free will. Aranka and a few others stand in the way, not because they are rebels, just because of the fluke in their genes. Those with power will stop at nothing to protect their supremacy. Aranka is kidnapped and forced to watch as her fellow prisoners are killed one by one. A small band of outlaws from every corner of the globe fight to free the captives and preserve their own freedom. Kenyen, a young doctor, ventures into the heart of oppression but he can't stop the terror. He just wants to save one life. In the process he uncovers "the Seed," the first flicker of hope in a thousand years.
