20750028:::::Fearless:::::When I met Kiersten, time stood still. It was as if every cell in my body screamed HER. I couldn't look away, I couldn't walk away, I couldn't even move. My other half, my soul mate, was staring right at me. I had to have her. I had to make her mine. But I felt selfish doing that--knowing that I may not have endless amounts of time to give her...and even now that every things' over with and I've been given that time back. Nothing is ever certain in this life. Which is why I'm about to do something crazy, impulsive, daring. After all, what type of person would I be if I didn't take my own advice? I'm jumping off the cliff, I'm living fearlessly. This is the continuation of Wes and Kiersten's story.
