948212:::::The Coup:::::The Coup describes violent events in the imaginary African nation of Kush, a large, landlocked, drought-ridden, sub-Saharan country led by Colonel Hakim F lix Ellello . ( A leader, writes Colonel Ellello , is one who, out of madness or goodness, takes upon himself the woe of a people. There are few men so foolish. ) Colonel Ellello has four wives, a silver Mercedes, and a fanatic aversion cultural, ideological, and personal to the United States. But the U.S. keeps creeping into Kush, and the repercussions of this incursion constitute the events of the novel. Colonel Ellello tells his own story always elegantly, and often in the third person from an undisclosed location in the South of France. From the Trade Paperback edition.
