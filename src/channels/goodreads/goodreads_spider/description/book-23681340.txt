23681340:::::Politixworks:::::Politixworks is a satirical examination of the fecklessness of leadership in a modern democracy. In it there are allusions to the two normative ideologies, liberalism and conservatism, wrestling with each other through the personifications of Lyndon Johnson and Theodore Cruz. Struggling to win the hearts and minds of a community of 12 year old children, the two rivals are like "old ghosts batting for the soul of their class". Both aspire to lead the 6th grade to their own ends which requires that they transform into political leaders. They are craven, crass, brutish, impulsive and reckless, and in all ways that matter, reflect the accurate caricature of the modern politician.
