13623846:::::The Vengekeep Prophecies:::::You can t convict what you can t confirm. That s the motto of 12-year-old Jaxter Grimjinx and his infamous family of thieves. And while Jaxter may not have his father s burglary prowess, his mother s forgery skills, or his little sister s mastery of sleight-of-hand, his book-fed knowledge of non-magical solutions to magical problems makes him invaluable to the family s heists. But the Grimjinxes may have pulled one con too many in their hometown, Vengekeep. After swapping the prophetic tapestry used to guide Vengekeep s actions for a fake concocted by Jaxter s mother, the Grimjinxes are stunned when the false prophecies begin coming true, bringing destruction in their wake. Suddenly, Vengekeep is besieged by natural disasters and rampaging monsters, courtesy of the secretly enchanted counterfeit tapestry. With his family forced to stay and combat the impending doom, Jaxter must leave his hometown in search of a way to keep the increasingly dangerous prophecies from wiping Vengekeep off the map.
