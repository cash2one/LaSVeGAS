309335:::::A Woman's Guide to a Simpler Life:::::Considering job, housework, and child care, women work roughly fifteen hours more each week than men. A Woman's Guide to a Simpler Life is a thoughtful and eloquently written primer that shows women how to set limits and clear their minds and closets to create space for what is truly valuable: work, home, family, friendships, and traditions. Dr. Van Steenhouse identifies three key obstacles to simplification: the fear of appearing selfish, the tug of internal resistance, and the trap of perfectionism. Pointing out the perils of modern living, she shows us that we don't have to be slaves to technology; we can pull the plug sometimes to give ourselves space. With sensible, soulful advice and real-life anecdotes, A Woman's Guide to a Simpler Life helps women minimize intrusions upon their spirits that take up time and energy without providing a sense of renewal and enrichment. It encourages women to listen to their hearts, absolve themselves of guilt and unrealistic expectations, have the courage to say no, and pare away nonessentials to live a saner, more fulfilling life. Dr. Van Steenhouse's invaluable lesson: A simpler life is one in which the knowledge of what matters dictates all that surrounds us, giving us the courage to let go of what our hearts know does not belong.
