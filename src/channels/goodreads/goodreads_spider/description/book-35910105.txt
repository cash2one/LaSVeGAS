Then my savior came. He left a bloodbath to find me. He loves me. He wants his Angel to be free. But how can I fly again when my wings are broken? Alessio This war isn t over. If he thought he could break her and just disappear, then he was wrong. I am going to find him and break him like he broke her. I made a vow to my Angel. I promised to let her fly I promised to save her soul. And I never break my vows.
