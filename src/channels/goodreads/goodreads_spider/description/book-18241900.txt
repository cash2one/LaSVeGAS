18241900:::::Size Matters:::::A few hard truths...Don t bet on Hasselhoff, Bigfoot might actually exist, and searching for the impossible may lead you to your heart s desire... It s a big fat hairy deal when I lose yet another bet to my best friend, Rena. Not only do I end up attending Bigfoot meetings with her kooky Aunt Phyllis, I find myself traveling with a band of reality TV, Sasquatch-hunting nut-jobs! Not to mention a suspiciously shady film crew. As if those little nuggets weren t enough to send me on the express-train to Crazytown...I stupidly swore off men! Clearly all this would mess up any gal s social life, but the worst part of the story? The minute I send my libido on vacation, I meet Mitch. Yep, Mitch, the sexiest cop ev-ah. The hottest, best kissing, finest tushied, SINGLE guy I ve ever laid eyes on. I d rather be hot on his trail than anything that involves the word Big or Foot. But sometimes what you re hunting for has been right in front of you all along
