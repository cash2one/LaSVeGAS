20986243:::::The Diary of a Social Butterfly:::::Pakistan may be making headlines but Butterfly is set to conquer the world. Everyone knows me. All of Lahore, all of Karachi, all of Isloo oho, baba, Islamabad half of Dubai, half of London and all of Khan Market and all the nice, nice bearers in Imperial Hotel also...No ball, no party, no dinner, no coffee morning, no funeral, no GT Get-Together, baba is complete without me. Meet Butterfly, Pakistan s most lovable, silly, socialite. An avid partygoer, inspired misspeller, and unwittingly acute observer of Pakistani high society, Butterfly is a woman like no other. In her world, SMS becomes S &amp; M and people eat three tiara cakes while shunning do number ka maal . What cheeks! as she would say. As her country faces tribulations from 9/11 to the assassination of Benazir Bhutto Butterfly glides through her world, unfazed, untouched, and stopped short only by the chip in her manicure. Wicked, irreverent, and hugely entertaining, The Diary of a Social Butterfly gives you a delicious glimpse into the parallel universe of the have-musts.
