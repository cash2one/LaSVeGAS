23709594:::::Pantheisticon: A Modern English Translation:::::John Toland's Pantheisticon is presented here in a commemorative new edition for modern readers translated into modern English. First published in Latin in 1720 and in eighteenth century English in 1751, this work is both fascinating and seminal. Pantheisticon explores Pantheist beliefs and presents a liturgical model for Pantheist community. This edition includes both a modern English translation and transcript of the 1751 text, plus an introduction by Dr Jason Cooper as well as an explanatory essay titled 'The Eternal Universe as God: Rediscovering Pantheisticon'. The essay establishes Toland as a key thinker of the Early Enlightenment and also a figure well ahead of his time. Dr Cooper explores the life of Toland, his influences and contributions to Philosophy, including Natural, Social, Political and Religious, and his ongoing relevance in the twenty-first century and beyond. Also included is a glossary detailing Toland's 'Universe of Terms' emerging from Pantheisticon and his earlier Letters to Serena (1704) that showcase his myriad contributions to Pantheism, Cosmology and the Philosophy of the Universe. The edition will please not only Pantheists but anyone wanting to know more about the key writings of one of history's greatest advocates of freedom and individualism.
