10754265:::::The Written:::::His name is Farden. They whisper that he s dangerous. Dangerous is only the half of it. Something has gone missing from the libraries of Arfell. Something very old, and something very powerful. Five scholars are now dead, a country is once again on the brink of war, and the magick council is running out of time and options. Entangled in a web of lies and politics and dragged halfway across icy Emaneska and back, Farden must unearth a secret even he doesn t want to know, a secret that will shake the foundations of his world. Dragons, drugs, magick, death, and the deepest of betrayals await. Welcome to Emaneska. -------------------- Want to know what The Written is? Just think Lord of The Rings meets Sin City, and you'll be on the right track. The Written is the first volume in The Emaneska Series and the debut book of young UK author Ben Galley.
