552966:::::Thrashed:::::Thrashed is the 9th collection of this incredibly popular strip. All the usual suspects are here: Jeremy; his friends Hector, Sarah, and Pierce; and Jeremy's long-suffering mom and dad. The crew find themselves wrapped up in all the angst and anxiety that life can muster, from keeping the gas tank above "E" to understanding the meaning of life. Through it all, Zits maintains its focus on the adventurous-if-sometimes-pockmarked journey that teens take toward adulthood. This Zits collection is perfect for both teenagers and those who share residences with them, or ever did. Its warm and sympathetic tone brings humor and insight, even though the terrain is often rocky.
