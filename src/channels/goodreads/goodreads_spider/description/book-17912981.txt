17912981:::::The Grendel Affair:::::We re Supernatural Protection &amp; Investigations, known as SPI. Things that go bump in the night, the monsters you thought didn t exist? We battle them and keep you safe. But some supernatural baddies are just too big to contain, even for us When I moved to New York to become a world famous journalist, I never imagined that snagging a job at a seedy tabloid would change my career path from trashy reporter to undercover agent. I m Makenna Fraser, a Seer for SPI. I can see through any disguise, shield, or spell that a paranormal pest can come up with. I track down creatures and my partner, Ian Byrne, takes them out usually saving my skin in the process. Our cases are generally pretty routine, but a sickle-wielding serial killer has been prowling the city s subway tunnels. And the murderer s not human. The fiend in question, a descendant of Grendel yes, that Grendel shares his ancestor s hatred of parties, revelry, and drunkards. And with New Year s Eve in Times Square only two days away, we need to bag him quickly. Because if we don t find him and the organization behind him by midnight, our secret s out and everyone s time is up.
