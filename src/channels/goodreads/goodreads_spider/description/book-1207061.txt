1207061:::::Flying Horse:::::Phil Marsten isn't just Stevie Lake's boyfriend. He's a fellow rider and he knows how to push all Stevie's buttons. When he issues a riding challenge that she can't turn down, Stevie starts _ training Belle intensely. In fact, her workouts threaten to make even good natured Belle balk at going into the ring. Mrs. Reg, the manager of Pine Hollow Stables, thinks Stevie and Belle need a break, so she takes The Saddle Club to Chincoteague and Assateague islands. Will seeing wild ponies running on the beach remind Stevie what riding is all about?
