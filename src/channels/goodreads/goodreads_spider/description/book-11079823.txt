11079823:::::The Silent Pulpit:::::Father Donavon held within him a terrible resolve. At every church he was assigned there would be several "silent" complaints about his character. He was a good priest and he lived according to the teachings of Jesus Christ. Still, there existed a horrid undertone of malcontent and ambition. The Church didn't really know what to do with him. If no one would work with Donavon, he was to be given his own church. Upon taking command of Saint Marcus Church, Donavon entered a bizarre world that only Poe or Lovecraft could have created. An attractive and out-of-place housekeeper named Anna. Donavon's nightly dreams would flood with images of her lovely body. An old priest named Mavis who held within him a "terrible secret" which could only be controlled with a permanent drunken stupor. Also, a church no one in the neighborhood seemed to remember or worshiped within. Secrets within secrets, clouded occasionally with an overcast of mystery. Donavon would soon learn the hidden horror behind Saint Marcus, and he would come to appreciate the devilishly insane power of THE SILENT PULPIT.
