17253356:::::Kale Pani:::::Kale Pani is a love story written on the back drop of cellular jail in Andaman during British rule in India. Since the book is written in pre-independence period, in the guise of love story it serves other purpose of nation building. It subtly pays homage to martyrs of 1857 revolution. It explains strategic importance of Andaman and describes nomadic tribes residing over there. The book also criticizes blind faith prevalent during that time. Savarkar also tells us about the hardships faced by prisoners in Andaman and how these criminal and political convicts helped turn this once inhabitable land into human society.
