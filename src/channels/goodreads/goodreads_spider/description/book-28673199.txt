28673199:::::How to Write Fiction: Tools and Techniques:::::In this book, Professor Murdock, an award-winning California State University teacher, has developed an innovative method to teach writers how to use the fictional tools and techniques available to them to create powerful stories that will engage readers from beginning to end. Using a step-by-step approach, Dr. Murdock takes writers through the creation of three example stories, stopping to discuss each writing decision as it occurs and explaining how each approach works to keep readers vicariously involved in the progression of the story. This is a book that will help writers understand how the choices they make affect readers in different ways. Even if you are not a writer, you will enjoy the three example stories, and you may find yourself intrigued to learn how stories are created.
