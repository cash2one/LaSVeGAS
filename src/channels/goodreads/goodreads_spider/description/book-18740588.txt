18740588:::::Choosing Christmas:::::All Chris wants is a normal Christmas. He s spent his life dodging the police and trying to protect his son from the life he s caught up in. He s just returned from killing a killer and he swears it's his last act as a criminal. That is until his boss, the sexy blonde who is too uptight for her own good, ends up in a compromising position. Sydney Collingsworth doesn t celebrate Christmas. She doesn t celebrate anything anymore. Unless you count a bottle of champagne every time she breaks up with another deadbeat boyfriend. Will these two opposites fall under the spell of the holidays long enough to realize they re perfect for each other or will each of their pasts catch up with them before they get the chance?
