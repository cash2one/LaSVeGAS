23288266:::::Impyrium:::::In the first book of Henry Neff s new high-stakes middle grade fantasy series, two unlikely allies the Faeregine princess Hazel and the servant boy Hob confront a conspiracy that will shake the world of Impyrium to its core. For over three thousand years, the Faeregine dynasty has ruled Impyrium. But the family s magic has been fading, and with it their power over the empire. Whether it s treachery from a rival house, the demon Lirlanders, or rebel forces, many believe the Faereginese are ripe to fall. Hazel, the youngest member of the royal family, is happy to leave ruling to her sisters so that she can study her magic. But the Empress has other plans for her granddaughter, dark and dangerous plans to exploit Hazel s talents and rekindle the Faeregine mystique. Hob, a commoner from the outer realms, has been sent to the city to serve the Faeregines and to spy on them. One wants to protect the dynasty. The other wants to destroy it. But when Hazel and Hob form an improbable friendship, their bond may save the realm as they know it or end it for good.
