12473983:::::Eternity:::::Eternity - the second book in the bestselling Guardian Saga... Maggie thought she was safe until an old enemy arrives in New Orleans with a dire threat: A battle is on the way. With only a few days to spare, she and Eran embark on a path that is expected to prepare them for the world s most evil creatures. But what Maggie discovers is far more disturbing the truth behind her identity and why their enemies will never give up. "The strange and compelling world-building begun in the first book is expanded significantly in this second installment. The increased complexity of the relationships certainly keeps this story from ever becoming dull or predictable. Unfailingly mesmerizing, this series has me hooked." (Coffee Time Romance) "4.5 Stars! Indie gem! While I really enjoyed the first book, Fallen, in the Guardian Trilogy, the second installment was even better. If you love angels and are looking for an intense read I highly rec this series! I m starting the 3rd and final book tonight, Reckoning." (The Book Hookup)
