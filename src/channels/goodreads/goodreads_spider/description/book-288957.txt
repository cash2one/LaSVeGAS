288957:::::Maximum Bob:::::Hilarious .Strange and risky .A right-on, pitch perfect novel, with wide social scope, comic genius, page-burning storytelling magic, and juicy characters who wrench your heart and gut. Washington Post Book World A character so outrageous he could only have come from the ingenious imagination of Elmore Leonard, lewd, lecherous, law-bending Florida jurist Judge Robert Maximum Bob Gibbs has been judged guilty by a grudge-bearing malefactor and sentenced to death by alligator, if necessary. Maximum Bob is a delightfully dark classic thriller from the greatest crime writer of our time, perhaps ever ( New York Times Book Review ), and any reader who loved getting gleefully lost in criminal mayhem of Get Shorty, Rum Punch, Out of Sight, The Hot Kid, or any number of the inimitable Leonard s numerous crime fiction masterworks will get maximum enjoyment out of this one.
