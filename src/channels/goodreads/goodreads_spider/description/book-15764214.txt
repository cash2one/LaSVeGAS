Life onboard a space ship pursued through the void is precarious at best, where the difference between living and dying is measured one instant to the next. On the run, Dynan Telaerin s responsibilities increase to the breaking point while he s the only one capable of flying the ship and making one repair after the other to his almost crippled craft, at the same time as trying to be a husband to his new wife, Loren. Bringing her and Marc Talryn into the terrifying danger that is Dynan s life, hardens his resolve to protect them at all cost. Making it back to the fold of the Brittallia System doesn t guarantee safety, as betrayals abound where he least expects it. They come from people he has trusted nearly the whole of his life. That life of peace, held for a brief moment in time, is abruptly shattered. Loren is taken from him in an attempt to forestall a terrible vision of death. The specter of evil haunts every thought and guides every action in the attempt to find her and keep her safe. The man who would take her and make the vision a reality is stalking him... ...driving him ever onward, leading him to the envisioned slaughter.
