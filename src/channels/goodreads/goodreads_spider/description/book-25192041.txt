He took my life away from me; my freedom, my courage. I've lived my life in debilitating fear since that fateful day. The Savior. He was there the day it all went down, and he's been by my side ever since. He's been the only thing that's kept me going. He's my best friend, but he wants more. I'm terrified to lose him. I'm terrified he'll leave. One tried to kill me. One brought me back to life. I'll never be the same person again--that girl died when the match was dropped. Too much has already been stolen from me. It's time to take back what's mine.
