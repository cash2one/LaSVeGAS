272752:::::Seedfolks:::::Newbery Medal-winning Seedfolks from Paul Fleischman tells thirteen stories from diverse perspectives young and old, immigrant and native, haunted and hopeful. A fractured neighborhood unites with just a few seeds, turning a drab empty lot in Cleveland into beautiful green garden. Seedfolks has been chosen as a state- and city-wide read in communities across the country for its inspiring message of unity. Kim begins the garden, planting a few lima beans to connect with her father who died when she was a baby in Vietnam. Then T o Juan, a farmer from Guatemala, gains purpose when he teaches the neighborhood children how to plant. Soon curious neighbors join in and together they grow a beautiful garden. With each bean sprout and cucumber blossom the residents of Gibs Street find hope and meaning in their little green paradise. As the Christian Science Monitor noted, "The size of this slim volume belies the profound message of hope it contains."
