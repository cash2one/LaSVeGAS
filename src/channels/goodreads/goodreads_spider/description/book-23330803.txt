23330803:::::Marriage by Law:::::What happens when an unsuspecting girl and guy are thrown into a marriage they don't want? That's exactly the case of Ivory and Darius, born into different families whose marriage serves to prevent competition between their businesses. No matter how they oppose the idea, their parents are hell-bent on marrying them to each other to honor a five-generation-old deal that took place between their ancestors. For Ivory, whose heart has just been broken, her marriage to the handsome but cold Darius Quartz fails to provide her the happy life she wants. Instead, she finds herself in endless boredom and doing the same things she'd been doing the past six months. That is, until Darius arrives home from his training and her ex returns in the picture. Thrown in her loyal best friend, Rose, and Darius's insane cousin, Adrian. Her life suddenly turns upside down and becomes exciting and a whole lot crazier! It's a long journey full of tears, fun, joy, even insanity, and most of all, love.
