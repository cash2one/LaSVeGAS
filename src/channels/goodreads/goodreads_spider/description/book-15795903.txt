15795903:::::Witch's Bell 3:::::Ebony is in trouble. This time it isn't some strange family curse or a hoard of tattooed wizards. It's her dreams; they've turned on her. Someone or something is trying to get at Ebony through her dreams. And it is powerful, horribly powerful. She might have faced trouble in the past, but she has never faced anything like this. If she can't find a way to stop it, Ebony Bell will die, and the rest of Vale will die with her.
