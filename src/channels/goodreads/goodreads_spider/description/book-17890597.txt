17890597:::::My Now & Forever:::::Whose parents abandon them in a trashy trailer when they are five years old? Oh Yeah! Mine do! Hey Hoochies! I'm Milly, and I am tired of taking kicks to the gut. A broken family, an asshole husband and the loss of loved ones have left me crying Uncle, and declaring a serious case of the Fuck-Its! I had my heart broken, stomped on and shattered before I ever started on my journey to find my little piece of happiness. With a bucket list, a '66 Ford and wild dreams, I set out on an adventure that changed my life forever. Follow me on my journey that resurrected my inner badass. I found my soul sista from another mista, and opened my dream shop along the way. Just when I gave up on finding true love, a pirate and a princess swept me off my ever lovin' feet and filled my world with sprinkles, mac n cheese and the courage to live again. They forced my fragile heart to trust and love without fear. Truth is, nobody s past stays hidden forever. It s an invisible monster waiting to attack and destroy. It has the capability to ruin everything you ve worked to set right. All it takes is one final blow to the gut to end everything.
