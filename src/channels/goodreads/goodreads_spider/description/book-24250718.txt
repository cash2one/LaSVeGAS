24250718:::::Against All Odds:::::Austyn He was my everything from the first moment I laid eyes on him. He could have asked me to marry him the first month and I would have said yes. I knew he was the one. He used to make my knees weak just at the sight of him. No one could have predicted it. That's life I suppose. Full of unexpected twists and turns. There were so many times I contemplated walking away; contemplated how much simpler my life would become...but it wasn't that easy; he wasn't easy to walk away from... Avery There was never any doubt in my mind that Austyn was the woman I would be spending the rest of my life with, I just didn t see the rush to the alter if we already knew that. My eyes never wandered, and, why would they? She was a modern-day goddess. No one could have prepared me for that day. Had I known, I still believe the outcome would have remained the same. I know it was difficult on her, it would have been difficult on anyone, but she stayed strong for me. I honestly believe she saved me-she saved my life. Against All Odds is the fifth book and final installment of the Infinite Love series.
