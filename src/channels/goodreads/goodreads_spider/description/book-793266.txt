793266:::::Invisible Threads:::::Naomi was never going to be like her mother. The crazy highs and underground lows. Naomi was in control. When the time came she would be the perfect mother nothing like her own. On the day Carrie-Anne turned 16, she surpassed her. The girl-woman who gave away her own child. Her biological mother. Carrie-Anne got to 16 without making that mistake. That s what she was, really a mistake. And now the invisible threads tying her to the past are driving her to find out why and how it happened. After all, if you don t know where you come from, how can you know where you belong? But sometimes asking questions is harder than hearing the answers. And sometimes the answers don t matter at all. From the Hardcover edition.
