216537:::::Theological Tractates/The Consolation of Philosophy:::::The classical and Christian worlds meet in Boethius (c. 480 524 CE), the last writer of purely literary Latin from antiquity. His Tractates examine the Trinity and incarnation in Aristotelian terms. His Consolation of Philosophy, a dialogue between himself and Philosophy, is theistic in tone but draws on Greek, especially Neoplatonist, sources.
