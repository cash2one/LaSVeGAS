25225265:::::Twisted Bond:::::I m an Italian-Texan woman in a family full of cops. I m passionate and shoot before I think. You only f*ck with me if you re stupid. Photograph cheating spouses. Hand over the evidence. Cash my check. That was my plan when I returned home to Holly Woods, Texas, and became a private investigator. Finding the dead body in my dumpster? Yeah Given the choice, I think I would have opted out of that little discovery, especially since all three of my brothers are cops. And my Italian grandmother is sure the reason I m single is because of my job. Of course, my connection to the victim is entirely coincidental. Until I m hired by her husband to investigate her murder and shoved bang-smack into the path of Detective Drake Nash. My nemesis, a persistent pain in my ass, and one hell of a sexy son of a bitch. Shame he still holds a grudge from that time I shot him in the foot twelve years ago, or we could have something. In another life. So now all I have to do is avoid my nonna s blind dates, try not to blackmail my brothers into giving me confidential police files, and absolutely do not point my gun at Drake Nash. Or kiss him. Or jump his bones. All while I hunt down the killer. Sounds totally simple until a second body proves that sometimes things that start as coincidences don t always end up that way ( Twisted Bond is book one of the Holly Woods Files series and while it does not end in a cliffhanger, it is not a standalone.)
