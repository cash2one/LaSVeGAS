23966802:::::Boy Band:::::*Young Adult Fiction* Sam Morneau is Melissa Parker s best friend. He s also a member of The Kind of September, basically the hottest boy band on the planet. After two and a half years, Mel is all too familiar with the day-to-day occurrences that come with being a member of the band s inner circle, including hectic schedules, passionate fans, and gossip-mongering celebrity girlfriends. Now, with the release of the group s third album just weeks away, their lives have never been crazier and Mel is doing everything she can to keep up, all the while trying to cope with the ridiculous rumors that follow the band everywhere they go and pretending that she isn t harboring a secret and hopeless crush on Sam. It s weird enough being in love with your best friend. It s even weirder when the rest of the world is in love with him, too.
