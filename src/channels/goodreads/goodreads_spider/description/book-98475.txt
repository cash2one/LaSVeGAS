98475:::::Stonewall Jackson: The Man, the Soldier, the Legend:::::One of the most successful Civil War books in history, Robertson's insightful examination of the life of Thomas "Stonewall" Jackson has touched the hearts and minds of readers on both sides of the Mason-Dixon line. As Robertson notes in his preface to Stonewall Jackson, this study "is not a biography of a great general; it is the life of an extraordinary man who became a great general...The intent here is to see life as Jackson saw it, to hear his words, to read his thoughts, to walk beside him and know more than he knew at a given time and place".
