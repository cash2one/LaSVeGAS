11316721:::::Spartacus and the Circus of Shadows:::::When Spartacus Ryan Poop Lip Zander finds his house destroyed and his wacko, Human Cannonball mother missing, it s obvious that she s been kidnapped by Bartholomew s World-Renowned Circus of the Incredible. But when his dad and brother refuse to believe it because they re morons, obviously it s up to Spartacus to be the hero. With the Internet-wizardry of his best friend and clues from his mom s postcards, Spartacus sets out on a zany, west coast rescue mission. But as the stories about the circus get stranger (and Spart s enemies get weirder), he realizes the only way to bring his family back together is to bring the big top down, once and for all.
