18813279:::::Sector of Lightning:::::Thousands of years ago, an ancient civilization of people battled with future European settlers and Native Americans as they tried to hide their technological advances. The leaders of this world controlled their people through a primitive form of media where the reporters were always the victims. Sector of Lightning follows the story of four messengers who battle for not only their own rights, but the rights of their people; Roselyn Elliot, the young English settler who is kidnapped by the Fire region and learns how to contribute to her new world; Bovas Brown, a young man from the Lightning region who knows more secrets than any child should now; Veina Marcie, a talented leader who is set up to fail; and Shaw Crosby, a strong but sensitive messenger from the Thunder region who must escape his own demons. This story follows them and other messengers who want to break away and stay united, and the ultimate battle between right and wrong is given a unique twist.
