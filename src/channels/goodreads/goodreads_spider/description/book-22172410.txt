22172410:::::If I Break:::::When I met Cal Scott, I knew he d be a distraction. At six-foot-two, with ebony hair, deep gray eyes, and a smile that could only hide an agenda, I knew he was trouble. And for the first time in my life, a little trouble was just what I needed. No. What I wanted. It wasn t like I d ever marry the guy. Until I did. What I thought would be my happily ever after, was only the beginning. Cal has a secret. One that makes loving him come with a price, and being his wife cost more than I bargained for.
