18367412:::::Pierced Love:::::Zar Evans is not your typical high school senior; in fact she is anything by normal. Dressing to the trendiest Goth fashion, Zar wears nothing but black from head to toe. Not that this warrants unwanted attention, but she is also top in her class and is looking at a full academic scholarship to Iowa State in the fall. Loudon Clarke is an all star athlete. He plays three varsity sports and has the world in his hands. Except for one thing; Loudon is failing majority of his subjects. He is about to be suspended from the basketball team risking his athletic scholarship. Zar and Loudon would normally never cross paths, until these two are brought together when Zar s brother proposes to Loudon s sister. With an upcoming wedding and a lot of planning Zar and Loudon are stuck with one another regardless of their differences. Zar has hidden behind the pain she deals with on a daily basis for years. Loudon has never had to feel pain nor the ignorance of his peers. Can opposites really bring these two together or will they be pulled even further apart. Only one thing is for sure, it is impossible to fight the connection of pierced love when one is willing to change for happiness.
