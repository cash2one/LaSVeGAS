15698746:::::Shallow:::::Nick Hawke wants his car fast and his girls faster. He blows through them quicker than his muscle car races down the drag strip in Collinsville and he wouldn t have it any other way. He s determined to avoid the devastation he has watched his father endure in the aftermath of his mother s abandonment. He believes there is no room in his life or his heart for a relationship lasting more than one night. He seeks happiness in things that won t let him down fast cars, adrenaline highs, and one night stands. All of that changes when he unexpectedly runs into an old friend and is introduced to Payton Archer, the first girl he ever wanted for more than a night. There s only one catch she s completely immune to him and his smooth talking ways. Payton Archer is looking for love the true, mad, deep kind. She s given up on finding it, at least until she leaves for college because she s certain that is where she ll find the ideal guy to fit into her perfect world. Her summer plans include nothing more than three uneventful months of fun but it turns out to be anything but ordinary when Payton meets Nick Hawke, one of Jesse s old Collinsville friends. She s shocked by her immediate and intense attraction for Hawke because nothing about him is on her checklist for the perfect love. Sure, he s hot and sexy but he comes from Collinsville and that is definitely not on her list of prerequisites. Everything about him makes Payton s heart speed. He s exciting and dangerous but his fast car and chance taking aren't what scares Payton the most. It s the way Nick Hawke makes her feel every time he looks at her. Can Payton find the courage to leave the safe, shallow end of love and risk going under completely? Shallow is Book 2 of 2 in the Going Under Series but may be read as a stand alone. This is a second edition with new editing and added scenes. This is a mature young adult/new adult novel and recommended for readers 16+ due to sexual content.
