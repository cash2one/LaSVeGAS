1839896:::::Why Is There Something Rather Than Nothing?: 23 Questions From Great Philosophers:::::Can nature make us happy? How can we know anything? What is justice? Why is there evil in the world? What is the source of truth? Is it possible for God not to exist? Can we really believe what we see? There are questions that have intrigued the world's great thinkers over the ages, which still touch a chord in all of us today.
