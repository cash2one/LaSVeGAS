He was a vibrant personality who wrote a Pulitzer Prize-winning classic novel four decades ago. And that's the last the world heard of William Forrester. That is until Jamal Wallace, a brash 16-year-old with a secret passion for writing, invades Forrester's sheltered existence in the South Bronx and re-ignites the dreams of this literary legend in the winter of his life. Known as the neighborhood recluse, Forrester is a man whose mystery and eccentricity border on the mythical. When Jamal a talented African-American scholar-athlete who is recruited by an elite Manhattan prep school for his brilliance on and off the basketball court sneaks into his apartment and accidentally leaves behind his backpack full of writings, they both get something unexpected in return. Forced to look past skin color and suppositions, Jamal encounters not only his first fan, but a mentor who will challenge and change him forever, and Forrester has his first reason in years to emerge from his self-imposed solitude.
