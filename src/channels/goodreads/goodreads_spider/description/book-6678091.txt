6678091:::::Gypsy Boy:::::Mikey was born into a Romany Gypsy family. They live in a closeted community, and little is known about their way of life. After centuries of persecution Gypsies are wary of outsiders and if you choose to leave you can never come back. This is something Mikey knows only too well. Growing up, he rarely went to school, and seldom mixed with non-Gypsies. The caravan and camp were his world. But although Mikey inherited a vibrant and loyal culture his family s legacy was bittersweet with a hidden history of grief and abuse. Eventually Mikey was forced to make an agonising decision to stay and keep secrets, or escape and find somewhere he could truly belong.
