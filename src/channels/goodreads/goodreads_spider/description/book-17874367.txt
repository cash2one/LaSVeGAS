After what seemed an endless addiction to love- wounds began to heal, and a greater value of self came forth. As author Vpain discovers what it means to be a woman, she documented each step in her struggle for actualization. She reaches out to people of all calibers who seek to break the destructive or abusive cycles which can plague their lives. Using several different poetic forms, she ranges from raw poetic motion to sensual sonnets. Just when you fall in love, you may laugh- and shortly thereafter shed a tear. This emotional poetry collection is aimed at a mature audience, yet some poetry may be appropriate to share with younger loved ones. Brace yourself for Hear Me Roar . Feel free to enjoy the excerpt and even share it as you experience the 'poesy' of Vpain. https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtl3...
