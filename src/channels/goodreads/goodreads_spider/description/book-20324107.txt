20324107:::::Destroyed:::::She has a secret. I m complicated. Not broken or ruined or running from a past I can t face. Just complicated. I thought my life couldn t get any more tangled in deceit and confusion. But I hadn t met him. I hadn't realized how far I could fall or what I'd do to get free. He has a secret. I ve never pretended to be good or deserving. I chase who I want, do what I want, act how I want. I didn t have time to lust after a woman I had no right to lust after. I told myself to shut up and stay hidden. But then she tried to run. I d tasted what she could offer me and damned if I would let her go. One secret destroys them.
