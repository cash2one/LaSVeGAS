29916072:::::Fall Into Temptation:::::Beckett Pierce is the most eligible bachelor in the nosiest small town in upstate New York. But after his last girlfriend handcuffed herself to his porch and set his welcome mat on fire, he's not looking for any more romance. Even if it lands right in his backyard, and has miles of red hair. Gianna Decker has her hands full--no, overflowing--with problems. With two kids, a useless ex, and a brand new yoga studio, the last thing on her mind is finding a man who'll cause her more problems. Dating her broody landlord? Yeah, that would be a problem. Dating the sexy mayor of the town she just moved to? Definitely a problem. Dating the favorite son of her father's new lady friend? It seems like Beckett is a bad idea just waiting to happen. But he's a bad idea she can t seem to resist. As Beckett and Gianna find themselves thrown together again and again, they can't help but fall into the temptation of sizzling stolen kisses, of a desire so hot it brands. And soon they're much, much closer than they ever wanted. Tempers flair when their families complicate things and the interfering citizens of Blue Moon Bend step in with their special brand of chaos. Can Beckett and Gianna manage to disentangle themselves before it s too late? Or is the temptation too much for either of them to deny?
