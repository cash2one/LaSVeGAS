18402055:::::Jack Who?: Perfect Storms:::::Marissa is a craps dealer, and in one quick second that she never wants to remember, her life turns to crap. Her best friend convinces her that the cure for a breakup is a hookup, and reluctantly, she heeds this advice. However, Jack (what was his name again?) is not the average girl's revenge sex. Jack is a celebrity in his niche of the music world. Women throw themselves at him, toss their lingerie on the stage, and scream his name. Marissa has no idea of his public identity, and while she does not initially throw herself at him, she does go on to toss aside her lingerie and ultimately scream his name. Five minutes after parting, Marissa holds no illusions about seeing him again, but does vow a new outlook on her life and herself. Five days later, they exchange a very short text. Five months later, Jack astounds her with an invitation to Los Angeles. Although Jack is now a star in her very non rock star fantasies, Marissa is concealing a huge secret that prevents her from accepting. Five years later, the secret comes out and despite the conflicting emotions each feels towards the another, they must meld their two worlds together.
