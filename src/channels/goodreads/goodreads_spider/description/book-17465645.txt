17465645:::::Chateau d'Argol:::::An isolated castle stands in a wild, desolate landscape, surrounded by dark woods. Its new owner, a rich, dissolute young man, has invited his best friend to stay. When he arrives, he brings with him a radiant, seductive and strangely detached young woman. She, in turn, will bring death and destruction to the Ch teau d'Argol. With its opulent, atmospheric descriptions of a savage, surreal Breton landscape and its exquisite sense of foreboding, Ch teau d'Argol is a work of beauty and terror.
