34348269:::::Elephant and Rabbit as Told by Skib Bricluster:::::Elephant and Rabbit are philosophers without peer, pondering everything from the existential dilemma of a particular snowflake to how to get a whale out of a river and back to the fjords (oh, wait - they really did that). They meet a drooling panther with an old grudge, a chicken with an inferiority complex, and Elephant's mother, who has come to reclaim her son. Can the friendship of Elephant and Rabbit withstand these pressures? And when they meet a Tier II Dragon, can Rabbit hide his eye roll? T. A. Young's incomparable wit and depth will make you laugh out loud, and leave you pondering. But who are they, really? Author T. A. Young, talking about Elephant and Rabbit on Art Speak, said, "They are Sancho and Don Quixote, Laurel and Hardy, Androcles and The Lion, Vladimir and Estragon, Hope and Crosby...friends, brothers, hosts to all visitors to the magical forest, tour guides to eternity..."
