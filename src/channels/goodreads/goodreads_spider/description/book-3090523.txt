3090523:::::End of History:::::With the onset of the twenty-first century, the impulse of our times is to escape from the implications of history, and replace it with whatever is fashionable or politically correct. The standars that have upheld Western Civilization have give way to relativism. Current historiography is being trivialized and politicized. Revisonist historians are rewriting history to suit the purposes of various pressure groups. This in effect makes history meaningless. If history has no meaning, then it is proper for history to be revised according to the current politically correct point of view. Yet, if history has meaning, it must be confronted, for the meaning of history conclusively affects our lives. This essay looks at this question, not only throught the eyes of the historian, but also with references to the philosophical and theological implications of this problem. This work examines these issues and the ultimate meaning of history. It looks at how history has effected our culture, our civilization, and our lives. It's thesis delves into the different definitions of history, the role of the historian, and various philosophies of history. The role of Providence in history is also examined, as well as the final purpose and goal of history. This focus on the meaning of history in our civilization is necessary as we face the threats of the new millennium, if our society and culture are to survive and thrive, rather than decline and decay.
