Convinced the police are looking in all the wrong places, eighteen-year-old Piper Sail begins her own investigation in an attempt to solve the mystery of Lydia s disappearance. With the reluctant help of a handsome young detective, Piper goes searching for answers in the dark underbelly of 1924 Chicago, determined to find Lydia at any cost. When Piper discovers those answers might stem from the corruption strangling the city and quite possibly lead back to the doors of her affluent neighborhood she must decide how deep she s willing to dig, how much she should reveal, and if she s willing to risk her life of privilege for the sake of the truth.
