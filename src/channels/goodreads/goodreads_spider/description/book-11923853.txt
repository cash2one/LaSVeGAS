11923853:::::Queen Unseen: My Life with the Greatest Rock Band of the 20th Century:::::An intimate and affectionate insider's story of his years spent alongside Queen, with exclusive personal photos For more than a decade, Peter Hince worked alongside one of the greatest bands in the history of rock, touring the world and heading up their road crew as they performed at some of the best and biggest music venues in the world. Here he recalls the highlights of those years with the band. He was with Freddie Mercury when he composed "Crazy Little Thing Called Love;" he was responsible for making sure that Freddie's stage performances went without a hitch; and he was often there to witness Freddie's famed tantrums. He was also party to the sex, drugs, and rock and roll which are invariably part of life on the road with a rock band. Many books have been written about Queen and Freddie Mercury, but this is the first real insider's story. Packed with the author's own exclusive photos, including never-before-seen shots of Freddie, his female lover Mary, and other band members, this warm and witty book will entertain and inform as a must-read for any music fan.
