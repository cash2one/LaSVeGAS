82405:::::Jesus of Nazareth: From the Baptism in the Jordan to the Transfiguration:::::"This book is . . . my personal search for 'the face of the Lord." - Pope Benedict XVI. This is Pope Benedict XVI's first book since his pontificate began. Who is Jesus? According to the wildly popular book and film, The Da Vinci Code, Jesus was merely a human figure whose original message was distorted by his followers. Not so, argues Pope Benedict XVI in this inspiring well-argued, and thoughtful new book. Benedict sums up two thousand years of Christian insight about the person and work of Jesus Christ. The early Christians did not misinterpret Jesus. Indeed, their understanding of Jesus is the one that makes the most sense based on the historical evidence. "Who do men say that I am?" Jesus asked his disciples. The answer to that question is as crucial and timely today as when it was first asked two thousand years ago. Jesus Christ remains the pivotal figure of human history. In his first major book written as Pope, Benedict XVI looks at various answers to the question of Jesus' identity. He shows in a "theological narrative" how the Christ of the Gospels, the Jesus of the Church's faith, is the genuine Jesus of history. He presents Jesus as someone we can know personally, and someone who knows and loves us. And who sacrificed himself for our salvation. Jesus of Nazareth also continues the conversation about the relationship of Christianity and other world religions. Benedict XVI affirms the truth found in other religions, but he also expresses the Christian conviction that Jesus, the Word of God made flesh, embodies the fullness of truth, God's immense love for the world.
