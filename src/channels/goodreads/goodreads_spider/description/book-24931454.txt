24931454:::::On Solway Sand:::::Seven reasons they have for risking life not fealty, faith, nor fee, but reasons of their own and cause enough to die for. On Solway Sand, set against the turmoil of sixteenth century Anglo/Scottish border conflict, is the third instalment of The Borderer Chronicles series. Jack Brownfield, a borderer, in a life not of his choosing, continues to travel a dangerous path not of his design. He seeks to escape the bonds that hold him. But ties, bound tightly, are never easy to break. This is a story of contrast and redemption, as seven seek salvation for a lonely Cumbrian village on a Solway shore. There is a place, ethereal, where the elements of rock and sand slowly melt into the sea. A place to find in the morning, when the wind is stilled and tide receded. When God s breath sits over the water and clouds the distant hills of Dumfriesshire in blues of unnatural hue.
