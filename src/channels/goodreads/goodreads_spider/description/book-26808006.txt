26808006:::::The Antichrist and Armageddon:::::Danyal Nicholson was born in a Christian family and he grew up around religious clerics and pastors. He attended Church on a weekly basis. He later studied world religions and had particular interest in the field of Sufism. In this book, Danyal mentions in a nutshell, the shocking truth that people need to be mindful of. Many people have been misguided by lies with regards to The Antichrist and the coming of Armageddon. If you wish to know the truth, then this is the perfect book for you! We must know how to live in these times and we must be acquainted with what to expect. We must not turn a blind eye to the shocking realities. We must not be fooled by conjecture and theory, but rather, we should adhere firmly to fact. There are unfortunately many liars out there who have written books on the topic of eschatology, some people have even went to the extent of mentioning that they have made research in an exhaustive fashion. However, their books are truly satanic as they are full of lies. One should perform their own research on religious doctrine for all religions and one should not be fooled by such liars who paint a religious nation under one brush. Every person is a unique being. Generally, we should hold a good opinion about one another. This is the truth that God has revealed to you. This book is a must read, not only for Christians and Muslims, but for people of all other faiths and beliefs too.
