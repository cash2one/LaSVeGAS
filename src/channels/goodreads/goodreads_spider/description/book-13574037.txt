13574037:::::Fusion:::::Patrick Hayward isn t used to feeling helpless. He s a man of action used to controlling his destiny. But falling in love with Emma Scarlett had a way of upending everything, his sanity included. Locked away as inmate number one-three-seven-oh for a crime he didn t commit, Patrick spends his days slopping toxic sludge onto trays, resisting the urge to tear the scratchy, orange jumpsuit from his body, and making sure every hardened criminal behind bars with him knows he s the biggest and baddest of them all. With the help of his handy little gift of teleportation, his nights are spent watching a certain green eyed goddess from the shadows. When he discovers a couple of Inheritors stalking her one night, he realizes the obstacle of explaining who and what he is to Emma might not be the biggest battle they face.
