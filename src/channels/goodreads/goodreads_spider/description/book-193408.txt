193408:::::Darconvilles Cat:::::The main story is a love affair between Alaric Darconville, an English professor at a Virginia women's college, and one of his students, Isabel. The style relies on complex syntax and unusual words. The satire is broad, and uses southern culture cliches but is often very funny. Some of the names of the girls at the school, for example, are Mimsy Borogoves, Barbara Celarent, and Pengwynn Custiss. The story is said to be based on Theroux's years of teaching at Longwood University, and places described in the book are easily recognized buildings on the campus.[citation needed]
