18798799:::::A Constant Heart:::::In a time and place where the only luxury forbidden was love, how can two hearts find each other? Trust was a valuable commodity at court. Traded by everyone, but possessed by no one. Its rarity was surpassed only by love. Love implied commitment and how could any of us commit ourselves to any but the Queen? Love implied singularity and how could any of us benefit another if our affections were bound to one in exclusivity? Love was never looked for and rarely found. When it was, it always ended badly. In Queen Elizabeth s court where men and women willingly trade virtue for power, is it possible for Marget to obtain her heart s desire or is the promise of love only an illusion?
