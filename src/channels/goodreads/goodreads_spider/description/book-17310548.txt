17310548:::::Saved at Sunrise:::::Nestled deep in the woods, Shadow Falls is a secret camp where teens with supernatural powers learn to harness their abilities and live in the normal world. But Shadow Falls is facing a problem that could finally expose them to the rest of the world. Humans are showing up dead, and rogue vampires may be to blame. Camp resident Della Tsang, who s still coming into her own vampire powers, is assigned to help find those responsible. If she succeeds, maybe she ll even land her dream job: working for the F.R.U., the enforcers of the supernatural world. But when she sees that her new partner is a hunky shapeshifter, things get complicated. Steve, too gorgeous to be trusted and capable of seeing through her tough-as-nails exterior, knows just how to get under her skin. And only hours into the mission, Della realizes rogue vampires aren t the only threat she s facing. If she s ever going to complete her assignment, she ll need his help but learning to trust him will be her hardest challenge yet.
