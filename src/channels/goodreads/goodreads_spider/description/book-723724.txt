723724:::::79 Park Avenue:::::A tale from master storyteller Harold Robbins ... Marja starts out a tough girl from the mean streets of New York. Ambitious and driven, over time she rises from street urchin to stripper, later re-inventing herself as Maryann Flood, the queen of an empire of pleasure. From her posh Park Avenue office, Maryann provides access to exciting and sensual women to sate the desires of New York's most powerful men. All is well-until Maryann runs afoul of the law and leaves her empire facing destruction. Arrested for procurement, blackmail, and bribery, she must face prosecutor Mike Keynes, who stands to benefit greatly by bringing her down-and who is facing a dilemma himself. He loves Maryann, and she loves him in return. Now he faces a choice: set aside his personal feelings for the sake of justice, or fall under Maryann's seductive spell and betray his life's work. The inspiration for the highly rated 1977 miniseries of the same name, 79 Park Avenue tells a sizzling tale of lust, power, and corruption.
