15828551:::::Indisputable Proof:::::When the Sudarium of Oviedo the venerable cloth that once covered Jesus Christ s face on the cross is stolen from a cathedral in Spain, it sparks a series of grisly murders. Each victim is killed in a manner resembling the form of execution of one of the Apostles. Now, with five days until the Sudarium is to be displayed at the start of the Feast of the Cross, and with the blame of the theft pointed at the United States, CIA operative Samuel Tolen, Spanish inspector Pascal Diaz and British archaeologist Dr. Jade Mollur embark on a journey to reclaim the Sudarium. Their search takes a surprising turn when a 2,000-year-old clue suggests a far greater secret is within reach, a startling discovery that would forever change humanity, but there are others after the treasure. A rogue group called The True Sons of Light are determined to destroy the archaeological evidence before they can reach it. In a deadly race against time spanning four continents, Samuel Tolen s search for the truth will uncover unspeakable deception and the chance to answer mankind s greatest question: Is there life after death?
