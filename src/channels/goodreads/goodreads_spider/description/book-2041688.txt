2041688:::::Columbus and Other Cannibals: The Wetiko Disease of Exploitation, Imperialism, and Terrorism:::::Celebrated American Indian thinker Jack D. Forbes s Columbus and Other Cannibals was one of the founding texts of the anticivilization movement when it was first published in 1978. His history of terrorism, genocide, and ecocide told from a Native American point of view has inspired America s most influential activists for decades. Frighteningly, his radical critique of the modern "civilized" lifestyle is more relevant now than ever before. Identifying the Western compulsion to consume the earth as a sickness, Forbes writes: "Brutality knows no boundaries. Greed knows no limits. Perversion knows no borders. . . . These characteristics all push towards an extreme, always moving forward once the initial infection sets in. . . . This is the disease of the consuming of other creatures lives and possessions. I call it cannibalism." This updated edition includes a new chapter by the author.
