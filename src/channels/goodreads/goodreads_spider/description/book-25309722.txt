25309722:::::Shot Through the Heart:::::Clint The Cowboy Maddox is a force to be reckoned with. Enforcer for the Sanitini family, the cowboy has known only violence, pain and death. But for a select few he calls brothers , Clint feels no love for mankind and believes that an eye for an eye is the only true means of retribution. Let the punishment fit the crime is his philosophy when dealing with his enemies. But upon meeting Axel Anders, a frightened and lost young man with a stained soul of his own, Clint s hard-as-steel exterior begins to crack as he finds himself intrigued by the effect this vulnerable kid has on him. Yet when Axel s presence begins to disturb the ground beneath which Clint s darkest, most painful memories have lain dormant for over two decades, he begins to understand that the young man poses a greater threat than any flesh and blood enemy and knows he must put the kid out of his life, or face a resurrected past that he believed to be dead and buried. But walking away from Axel and not looking back proves to be a much greater challenge than he is prepared for.
