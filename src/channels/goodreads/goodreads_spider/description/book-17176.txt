17176:::::The Sound and the Fury:::::Selected by the Modern Library as one of the 100 best novels of all time From the Modern Library s new set of beautifully repackaged hardcover classics by William Faulkner also available are Snopes, As I Lay Dying, Light in August, Absalom, Absalom!, and Selected Short Stories The Sound and the Fury, first published in 1929, is perhaps William Faulkner s greatest book. It was immediately praised for its innovative narrative technique, and comparisons were made with Joyce and Dostoyevsky, but it did not receive popular acclaim until the late forties, shortly before Faulkner received the Nobel Prize for Literature. The novel reveals the story of the disintegration of the Compson family, doomed inhabitants of Faulkner s mythical Yoknapatawpha County, through the interior monologues of the idiot Benjy and his brothers, Quentin and Jason. Featuring a new Foreword by Marilynne Robinson, this edition follows the text corrected in 1984 by Faulkner expert Noel Polk and corresponds as closely as possible to the author s original intentions. Included also is the Appendix that Faulkner wrote for The Portable Faulkner in 1946, which he called the key to the whole book.
