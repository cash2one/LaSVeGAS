Can a stranger's condition of submission be the key to one woman finding her wings again? A fragile woman ventures forth into a mall one day to buy a card and stops to admire a dress. A sensual stranger convinces her to try it on... So begins a game of full seduction through the loss of free will. One afternoon in the life of Meg, a woman whose heart is so raw, she believes she can never heal. Until she meets Daniel, a man who not only believes he can ease the pain of her past, but that Meg can live again if she can only learn to let go.
