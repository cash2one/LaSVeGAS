After being awarded one of the military s highest honours for her role in a daring rescue attempt, Jarra finds herself and her Ape status in the spotlight. Jarra is one of the unlucky few born with an immune system that cannot survive on other planets. Derided as an ape a throwback by the rest of the universe, Jarra is on a mission to prove that Earth Girls are just as good as anyone else. Except now the planet she loves is under threat by what could be humanity s first ever alien contact. Jarra s bravery and specialist knowledge will once again be at the centre of the maelstrom, but will the rest of the universe consider Earth worth fighting for?
