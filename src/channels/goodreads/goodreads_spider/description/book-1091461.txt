1091461:::::The 13 Crimes of Science Fiction:::::A private investigator hunts a killer &amp; uncovers a fantastic &amp; horrifying secret. An important man is murdered &amp; there are numerous suspects--each from a different planet. A computer helps a young man solve a puzzle &amp; assumes the personality of a long-dead gangster. Isaac Asimov has conspired with collaborators Martin Harry Greenberg &amp; Charles G. Waugh to mastermind this diabolically clever anthology in which each of the classic categories of crime fiction is represented by a science fiction tale. Here are such science fiction greats as Philip K. Dick, Larry Niven, Clifford Simak, Jack Vance &amp; the illustrious Dr. Asimov himself writing cosmic variations on the whodunit, how-done-it, why-done-it, the hard-boiled detective, the police procedural &amp; even a brand-new category--the psychic detective story. 9 The Universe of Science Fiction essay by Isaac Asimov 13 The Detweiler Boy (1977) Tom Reamy 49 The Ipswich Phial [Lord Darcy] (1976) Randall Garrett 97 Second Game (1958) Katherine MacLean and Charles V.
