The true successors of humankind are, in fact, digitally recorded human intelligences existing in vast cyber-cities. When an unexpected and powerful radiation storm from a nearby supernova wipes out the remnants of "flesher" humanity, an adventurous group of the digital intelligences sets out to explore the cosmos in search of other life-forms and a safe haven from material dangers.Born with only primitive cognition, these virtual beings continually expand their consciousness until they are capable of probing the deepest corners of the universe, leading readers to appreciate a new meaning of the word "humanity".
