9315614:::::Hope Unseen: The Story of the U.S. Army's First Blind Active-Duty Officer:::::Hope Unseen challenges readers to question their doubts, not their beliefs, and depend upon God no matter what the inspiring true story of blind faith. A nervous glance from a man in a parked car. Muted instincts from a soldier on patrol. Violent destruction followed by total darkness. Two weeks later, Scotty Smiley woke up in Walter Reed Army Medical Center, helpless . . . and blind. Blindness became Scotty s journey of supreme testing. As he lay helpless in the hospital, Captain Smiley resented the theft of his dreams becoming a CEO, a Delta Force operator, or a four-star general. With his wife Tiffany s love and the support of his family and friends, Scotty was transformed the injury only intensifying his indomitable spirit. Since the moment he jumped out of a hospital bed and forced his way through nurses and cords to take a simple shower, Captain Scotty Smiley has climbed Mount Rainier, won an ESPY as Best Outdoor Athlete, surfed, skydived, become a father, earned an MBA from Duke, taught leadership at West Point, commanded an army company, and won the MacArthur Leadership Award. Scotty and Tiffany Smiley have lived out a faith so real that it will inspire you to question your own doubts, push you to serve something bigger than yourself, and encourage you to cling to a Hope Unseen.
