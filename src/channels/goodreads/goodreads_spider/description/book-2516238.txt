2516238:::::Because Your Vampire Said So:::::Not just anyone can visit Broken Heart, Oklahoma, especially since all the single moms like me, Patsy Donahue have been turned into vampires. I m forever forty, but looking younger than my years, thanks to my new (un)lifestyle. And even thought most of my customers have skipped town, I still manage to keep my hair salon up and running because of the lycanthropes prowling around. They know how important good grooming is especially a certain rogue shape-shifter who is as sexy as he is deadly. Now, if only I could put a leash on my wild teenage son. He s up to his neck in danger. The stress would kill me if I wasn t already dead. But my maternal instincts are sill alive and kicking, so no one better mess with my flesh and blood.
