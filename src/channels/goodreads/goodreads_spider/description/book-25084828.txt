25084828:::::The Soulless:::::Tim Burchett and Amber Louise Forest never suspected they had boarded a cruise ship headed straight to Hell. They couldn't have been any more different. Tim was a former armored car driver lying low on the cruise ship after making off with half a million dollars of his employer's cash. Amber was the successful CEO of a mult-million dollar publishing company taking a much needed vacation from her high-stress job. Neither one could have predicted their cruise ship would be hijacked by terrorists. Neither one could have predicted they would have to rely on each other to survive. But the terrorists are the least of their problems. After the cruise ship's controls are blasted and the ship sent far off course, they find themselves shipwrecked on a remote Pacific island. On the island, Tim and Amber must survive outrageous terrors created by a twisted science that exceed a lunatic's most deranged nightmares.
