624352:::::Cents And Sensibility:::::Stella Fain has a rule for men she likes: make them wait ... But the gorgeous Jay proves an exception to the rule when he bowls Stella off her Prada wedges at a press junket on the Cote d'Azur. He might seem to have everything going for him, but Stella is about to realize that there's only thing worse than having a boyfriend with no money ... and that's having one with too much. Jetset lifestyles can be fabulous, but Stella's career as a journalist isn't something she wants to jeopardize for any man, no matter how filthy rich or gorgeous. And then there's her father - a six-times-married prime slice of Alpha Male with a grudge against inherited wealth ... and Jay. There's no denying money makes the world go round and diamonds are a girl's best friend, but they don't make the path to love any easier to tread. With or without the Prada wedges.
