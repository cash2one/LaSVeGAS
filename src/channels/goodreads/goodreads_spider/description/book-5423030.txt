5423030:::::A Big Little Life: A Memoir of a Joyful Dog:::::In a profound, funny, and beautifully rendered portrait of a beloved companion, bestselling novelist Dean Koontz remembers the golden retriever who changed his life. A retired service dog, Trixie was three when Dean and his wife, Gerda, welcomed her into their home. She was superbly trained, but her greatest gifts couldn t be taught: her keen intelligence, her innate joy, and an uncanny knack for living in the moment.

Trixie lived fewer than twelve years; in this wide world, she was a little thing. But in every way that mattered, she lived a big life.
