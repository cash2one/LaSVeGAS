5713780:::::Songs of the Dead:::::A serial killer stalks the streets of Spokane, acting out a misogynist script from the dark heart of this culture. Across town, a writer named Derrick has spent his life tracking the reasons political, psychological, spiritual for the sadism of modern civilization. And through the grim nights, Nika, a trafficked woman, tries to survive the grinding violence of prostitution. Their lives, and the forces propelling them, are about to collide. Derrick s current project is a book called Possession, which asks the ontological question of who is responsible for the culture of domination that s destroying the earth. Who actually benefits from a dead planet, the endgame that s fast approaching? What if the answer is something way bigger than humans? Meanwhile, with motivations opposite to Derrick s, the serial killer is asking much the same question of the women he kidnaps as his final act of possession and Nika is next. Derrick s metaphysical explorations suddenly take on more urgency as visions both terrifying and sacred begin to intrude, and past and future collapse without warning. All Derrick knows is Nika s name and her impending death. The only person who believes him is his partner Allison, a woman with both strengths and scars, whose past has led her to a commitment to justice no matter what the cost. As the visions intensify and the killer draws nearer, Derrick and Allison are compelled to act, making themselves the next targets. Derrick must learn to negotiate a world of spirits and demons, living and dead, before it s too late. And what hangs in the balance is not just their lives, but also the fate of life on earth.With Songs of the Dead, Derrick Jensen has written more than a thriller. This is a story lush with rage and tenderness on its way to being a weapon.
