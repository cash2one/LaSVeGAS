127663:::::Sati:::::The first adult novel from a bestselling author of young adult fiction. Michael picks up a young hitch-hiker in the Arizona desert, bringing her home and letting her sleep on his couch. The next day, she talks about being God--and strange things begin to happen to everyone coming in contact with her.. . . --SATI-- I once knew this girl who thought she was God. She didn't give sight to the blind or raise the dead. She didn't even teach anything, not really, and she never told me anything I probably didn't already know. --SATI-- On the other hand, she didn't expect to be worshipped, nor did she ask for money. Given her high opinion of herself, some might call that a miracle. --SATI-- I don't know, maybe she was God. Her name was Sati and she had blonde hair and blue eyes. --SATI-- For all who meet her, Sati will change everything. Sati may change everything for you. "Christopher Pike, the author of the bestselling young adult novel Chain Letter, takes an unusual approach. His mysterious, enlightened heroine, Sati, claiming that she is God, changes forever the lives of the people around her... [who learn] by her example about love, compassion, acceptance, and the beauty of life. Pike has the ability to tell a good story with conviction and clarity." --ALA Booklist
