6567682:::::Good Eats: The Early Years:::::Alton Brown is a foodie phenomenon: a great cook, a very funny guy, and underneath it all a science geek who s as interested in the chemistry of cooking as he is in eating. (Well, almost.) Here, finally, are the books that Brown s legion of fans have been salivating for two volumes that together will provide an unexpurgated record of his long-running, award-winning Food Network TV series, Good Eats . From Pork Fiction (on baby back ribs), to Citizen Cane (on caramel sauce), to Oat Cuisine (on oatmeal), every hilarious episode is represented. Each book the second will be published in fall 2010 is illustrated with behind-the-scenes photos taken on the Good Eats set. Each contains more than 140 recipes and more than 1,000 photographs and illustrations, along with explanations of techniques, lots of food-science information (of course!), and more food puns, food jokes, and food trivia than you can shake a wooden spoon at.
