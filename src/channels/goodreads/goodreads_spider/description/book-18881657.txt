18881657:::::Redeye: Book Two of the Wonderland Cycle:::::Praise for Redeye: "The well-edited prose whisks the reader through one surprise and revelation after another, and the story continues to be reminiscent of 'They Live', 'Snow Crash', and 'Ghost in the Shell'. Shean wraps up his second installment in the Wonderland Cycle with a double-twist, which I will not reveal here. Expect a thermonuclear finish in the next book." ~Amazon Review Two years have passed since Agent Thomas Walken and Bobbi January found themselves at the heart of a conspiracy of unimaginable greed and cruelty. The Genefex Corporation remains shrouded in mystery, and Bobbi faces a life of unanswered questions and mounting disillusionment to look forward to. But when she receives a mysterious message from one of Walken s former comrades, she is drawn back onto the trail. Now, Bobbi will find herself newly equipped to discover the truth about Walken, about Genefex and the Yathi race and the key to unlocking those secrets rests in the hands of a cyborg terrorist known only as Redeye. But the road to truth will be a dangerous one, from the glamour of Seattle s ultramodern core to the sprawling wastelands of the Old City and beyond. Alongside a band of lethal comrades, Bobbi will face death and worse amidst urban rot, abandoned subway tunnels, and ultimately the nightmarish halls of the Yathi themselves in a race to stave off what may prove to be the death of humanity itself. Drenched in blood and neon, Redeye is a tale of humanity on the edge of a new and terrible reality. Be sure to check out Bone Wires, by Michael Shean for more cyberpunk detective noir set in the same dystopian universe as Shadow of a Dead Star and Redeye.
