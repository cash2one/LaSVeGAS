Breeding programs began and the half-breeds were born. Lirabel is a half-breed and an overachiever. Despite a few setbacks, she s scheduled to graduate early from Mother Cora s and become the Half-breed Ambassador to the Humans. Enter Jonas. They were best friends until he broke her heart and disappeared five years ago. Now, he s back, but Lirabel couldn t care less.
