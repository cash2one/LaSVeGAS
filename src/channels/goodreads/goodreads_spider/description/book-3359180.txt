3359180:::::Dr. Strangelove, or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb:::::Novelization of the '64 film directed by Stanley Kubrick, starring Peter Sellers, George C. Scott, Sterling Hayden, Keenan Wynn, Slim Pickens. As with many of Southern's film screenplay projects there is a dispute about the level of his participation but without a doubt his caustic black humor pervades this classic film. Peter George's novelization closely follows the script of the finished film. "Kubrick s cool cynicism &amp; Terry Southern s caustic black humor are perfectly wedded in this vision of nuclear apocalypse brought about by a mad U.S. general s paranoia about women &amp; Commies. Nothing is sacred as Peter Sellers (in three roles), George C. Scott &amp; Slim Pickens set out to stop the 'Russkies' from polluting America s drinking water while trying to stave off Doomsday. Forty years since its initial release, Strangelove remains a perfect and timeless spoof of political &amp; military insanity."--International House, Philadelphia.
