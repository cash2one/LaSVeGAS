24690468:::::Down Under with the Hottie:::::Ten days in Sydney, Australia with my first boyfriend! My Spring Break couldn t be better. Sure, it s a mission for GASI, but we lucked out with our cover story. We are boyfriend and girlfriend traveling with a group of American high school students. I mean, sure, we have some terrorists to stop. And some of the teens on the trip aren t the nicest. Then there s this guy, Aaron, who seems to be watching us. With Grandma, Nic, Christie, and some help from the Australians, how can we lose? Except some of our help is actually a hindrance and we re down to the wire on stopping the terrorists from blowing up the Sydney Tower. The brutal truth is that missions fail, but can we live with ourselves if we don t succeed?
