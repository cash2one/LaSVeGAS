38400912:::::Why a Poem?:::::I think in the form of poems, a book isnt just a book to me. It is the start of a bundle of emotions and start of a journey within yourself. A bird doesnt only signify freedom, but even with wings, it comes back to its family, whether joyfully or regrettably. A piece of chocolate could taste bitter depending on who offered it and why for. I write poems seeing that it is my only way to express myself without self-destruction. It is spilling acid into my wounds without necessarily doing so. It is the purge I need to keep going every morning. I write to let go of my suffering and for you to know it, to feel it. I write poems though I know they wont make situations better. They wont change things. However, they will baffle you. That I can assure.
