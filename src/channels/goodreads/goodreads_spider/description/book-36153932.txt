36153932:::::Heartbreaker:::::They call me a heartbreaker. I ve constructed the exact type of life I want for myself--isolated from feelings, and numb to the world around me. Running from my own fears. Pretending I own the world. I get paid to be an a$$hole. Easiest money I ve ever made. Until I get paid to be one to her. She s the one person who digs beneath the layers to see the truth hiding there. Being paid to break her heart may be the hardest job I ve ever done. Why d she have to be so pretty? Why do I need her so bad? Why can t I just let her go? They call me a heartbreaker, but little do they know my heart is the one that lies bleeding.
