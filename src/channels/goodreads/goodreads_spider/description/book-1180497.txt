1180497:::::Single White Female:::::Imitation is the deadliest form of flattery . . . After a messy break-up, Allie Jones finds herself living alone in her New York City apartment, no one to share her bed with-and more urgently, no one to share her rent. The solution seems clear: she needs a roommate. And Hedra Carlson seems perfect-she's shy, quiet...safe. But soon Hedra's disturbing envy of Allie's looks and social life becomes unsettling. She wears Allie's clothes, even buys a wig in Allie's color and style. Then the obscene phone calls begin, Allie's credit cards vanish, and she discovers Hedra is living a dangerous double life . . . and far worse. For Hedra's twisted admiration has no limits, the nightmare has just begun, and there will be a bloody price to pay.
