1557363:::::Danger: Twins at Work!:::::In the words of 7-year-old Elizabeth Wakefield... My twin sister, Jessica, and I get to spend the day with our mom. She works in a big, fancy department store! I'm going to work hard. So is Jessica...I think. We can't get into too much trouble when Mom's around. Can we?
