647685:::::Perfect Skin:::::Jon Marshall, a thirtysomething plastic surgeon, has come a long way. He's a partner in his own medical practice, owns a house in the suburbs, and cruises town in a BMW. He also has a six-month-old daughter, Lily, affectionately known as the Bean. But Jon's life hasn't taken the path he thought it would in his twenties. Newly single, he's facing the challenges of dating in a post-Duran-Duran world. His computer has been seized by surly software. He accidentally peed on his date's cat.
