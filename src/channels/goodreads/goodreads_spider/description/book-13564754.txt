13564754:::::The Essential Lenny Bruce:::::Since his death in 1966, Lenny Bruce has been lauded as a great satirist "in the tradition of Swift," as a great parodist, a moralist, a preacher, even as a shaman exorcizing the demons of our modern society. Whatever Bruce was, he was above all an incredibly funny man with an extraordinarily original and fertile comic imagination. Transcribed from hundreds of hours of taped performances, this book brings into print Lenny Bruce's greatest insights and inventions in their original form.
