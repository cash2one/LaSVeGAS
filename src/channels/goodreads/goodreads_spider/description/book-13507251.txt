There is non-stop action throughout and its got tension-filled romance as well. Usually when there is a love triangle, I choose a side and stay there, but with this series I can't decide whose team I'm on. One book, it's hands down team Gage. Then in the next book I'm feeling bad for Logan. Now, even Marshall is growing on me!! Not to mention the suspense, which is KILLING me!" --Wendyirp "This is a must read series...
