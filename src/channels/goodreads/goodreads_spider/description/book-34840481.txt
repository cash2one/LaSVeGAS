34840481:::::Roommates with Benefits:::::Soren Decker. He s the epitome of the bad boy, good man persona. The best of both worlds. The worst of them too. He s the type of guy most girls wouldn t mind sharing a confined space with, except my new roommate isn t all swagger and chiseled abs. He s bossy. Messy. Cocky. Infuriating. Doesn t believe in personal space. Has no qualms about roaming the apartment with a loincloth-sized towel cinched around his waist. Seems under the delusion he s my personal protector (refer back to infuriating). He plays college baseball and holds down a part-time job I don t know where he finds the time to get on my nerves. We have nothing in common . . . except our attraction to one another. And in six hundred square feet of shared space, the tension only has so much room to grow before one of us gives in to temptation. But really, what chance do a couple of young kids chasing their dreams in the big city have of making it? Since Soren claims I know squat about sports (he might have a semi-point), here s a stat for him one in a million. That s our odds.
