359643:::::Charade:::::A beautiful woman. A savage betrayal. The perfect payback. But is revenge enough? Ollie Benson's computer program, Moviemaker.com, explodes onto the market, thrusting him into a world of glamour, fame, and fortune. He's extravagantly rich.

When the two people Ollie trusts the most betray him in brutal fashion, he constructs an elaborate plan for revenge. It's brilliant. It's perfect. There's just one glitch: Ollie is about to come face-to-face with the power of true, unconditional love. It could change his life. Or end it.
