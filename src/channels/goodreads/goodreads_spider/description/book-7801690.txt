7801690:::::Kidnapping Casey:::::All Casey wants is to avoid being arrested on trumped-up charges from her persistent ex-boyfriend. Running through the woods to escape two deputies sounds like a great plan until they catch her. Thinking it s all over, waiting to hear the snap of the handcuffs, she instead hears a roar. A huge, tall, muscular man comes to her rescue. She s being saved by Bigfoot and he s the sexiest thing she s ever seen. The attraction between them is instant, and after spending a little time with him, Casey wants to take him home and keep him. There are a few problems with that plan. He s not the legendary creature, but he definitely isn t human. Argernon is a warrior from Zorn. They do have one thing in common he wants to take her home and keep her. He s kidnapping Casey.
