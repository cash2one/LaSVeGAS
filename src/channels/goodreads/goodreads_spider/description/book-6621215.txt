Will changing into Cerberus give Nora the power he needs to face Fall's true form and stop the demonic invasion of Earth, or will Kazuma be forced to make a brutal sacrifice? Nora, an unruly demon, has defied his superiors one too many times. For the sake of his "education," Nora is sent to live among mortals and enters a bond of servitude with cool-as-ice star student Kazuma Makkari.
