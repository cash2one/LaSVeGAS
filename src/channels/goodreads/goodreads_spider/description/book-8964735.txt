8964735:::::Shedrow:::::From rolling pastures in Lexington, Kentucky, to darkened alleyways in Newark, New Jersey, from Manhattan's posh E21 Club to a peculiar and mysterious landfill in eastern Kentucky, and from Saratoga Springs, New York to the tiny island of St. Lucia, Shedrow portrays a collision of characters from many divergent worlds. It is a unique twist on the medical thriller. Dr. Anthony Gianni, a prominent Manhattan surgeon, becomes involved in a racing partnership as a diversion from a thriving surgical practice and an ailing marriage. The excitement builds when the partnership acquires Chiefly Endeavor, a two-year-old colt with the breeding, the spirit, and enough early racing success to qualify for the Kentucky Derby. When a new partner with an unsavory background appears and a breeder's nightmare becomes real, Dr. Gianni and a dedicated veterinarian must confront organized crime and solve a complex mystery that threatens to destroy both of their careers, and possibly a great deal more.
