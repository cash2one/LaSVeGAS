19043458:::::Three People:::::They were unlikely companions, the pampered Pliny Hastings, solidly brought-up Benny Phillips, and uneducated street scamp "Tode" Mall . . . not much chance, under ordinary circumstances, that they would ever meet. But God's plans are never ordinary, and the greatest miracles need only the seed of a tiny prayer to bring them to fruition. Thus it was one day in the repulsive rubbish heap of humanity known as "Five Points" that a dying mother showed her ragged, neglected boy the only kindness he would ever know from her when she prayed. "O Lord, don't ever let Tode touch a drop or rum!" And so that one small, desperate prayer went forth, setting in motion the beginnings of hope--and stirring in little Tode a determination so great that it transformed not only his life, but also the lives of the astonishingly different people whom he came to know, protect . . . and love.Heartwarming stories of faith and love by Grace Livingston Hill's aunt--Isabella Alden. Each book is similar in style and tone to Hill's and is set in the late 1800s and early 1900s.
