13566041:::::Shadow:::::Beauty resents being labeled Gift Species. Everyone is way too overprotective, males aren t even allowed to speak to her and so far true freedom eludes her. Then a big, sexy Species officer mistakes her for the enemy and takes her to the ground. Shadow is dumbfounded. He has a Gift pinned under him a big no-no. But Beauty is fascinated and wants to know Shadow a lot better. She is full of newly discovered, unrequited passion and he s just what she needs to satisfy her curiosity. For Shadow, sex means pain and revulsion. For Beauty, it was enslavement and ridicule. Two lonely souls who have never known a lover s touch, together in a cabin in the woods. Each touch, every discovery brings them closer to a life they never thought possible beyond even their dreams.
