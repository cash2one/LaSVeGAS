12323770:::::Collared:::::Trans-Global IT director Connor Witt is a rare and prized anomaly: the aggression centers in his brain have been suppressed rather than stimulated by the mutated crops that so recently took over the world s food supply. Bewildered by his physical changes and terrified of a world growing more and more predatory, Connor risks harassment and worse until Trans-Global CEO David Martin collars Connor to protect him against men like security consultant Emmett Drake. Men who stalk Connor as sweet, sexy prey. Men to whom the newly submissive Connor feels irresistibly drawn. But David can t be Connor s master; David s straight. He promises to find a worthy man, though. One willing to court and appreciate Connor as more than just some rich man s toy. While the world adapts to the biological disaster and new laws strip away Connor s rights, David s resolve to protect his boy slowly grows into something more. But can his new desires keep pace with Emmett s determination to claim Connor? One man offers safety; the other is a safer bet. Problem is, Connor s never sure which is which. The one thing he does know? He wants them both.
