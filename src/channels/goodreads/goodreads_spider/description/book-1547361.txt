1547361:::::Terry Fox: A Story of Hope:::::The first authorized biography written specifically for young readers! First published in 2005 in conjunction with the 25th anniversary of the Marathon of Hope, Terry Fox: A Story of Hope was created in co-operation with the Terry Fox Foundation and the Fox family, and is the first authorized biography of Terry Fox written specifi cally for young readers. Many young Canadians may have heard of Terry Fox, but don t know the whole story. With more school children than ever participating in the annual Terry Fox Run, this is the perfect tool for teachers and parents to talk about the legacy and life of one of Canada s greatest heros. Dozens of colour photographs and simple text combine to tell Terry Fox s story-from his early years as a boy who grew up loving sports and determined to fi nish what he started, through his treatment for cancer and the loss of his leg, to his historic run to raise money for cancer research. His story continues to inspire millions of people around the world, and the foundation carrying his name raises millions of dollars every year. The author s royalties and a matching donation from Scholastic will go to the Terry Fox Foundation.
