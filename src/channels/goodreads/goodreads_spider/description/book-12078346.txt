12078346:::::Bengali Girls Don't:::::Based on a True Story: Born in a remote village during her country's liberation war, a Bangladeshi girl moves to England with her parents and struggles for freedom and identity while growing up in a mixed neighborhood. Caught between the world of her white friends and that of her parents, she scraps her Muslim gear for blue jeans and runs away with her boyfriend. But when her father tracks her down and finds her, he tricks her into going to Bangladesh so that he can marry her off. In Bangladesh, she is faced with a choice: get married or never go home. It's an unforgettable true story about heartache and irony. About broken dreams. And how the life we choose is not always the life that chooses us. ABOUT THE AUTHOR L.A.
