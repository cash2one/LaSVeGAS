85211:::::Pronto:::::Speedy, exhilarating, and smooth. Nobody does it better. Washington Post The man knows how to grab you and Pronto is one of the best grabbers in years. Entertainment Weekly Fans of U.S. Marshal Raylan Givens of the hit TV series Justified are in for a major treat. The unstoppable manhunter with the very itchy trigger finger stars in Pronto , a crime fiction gem from the one and only Elmore Leonard, the greatest crime writer of our time, perhaps ever ( New York Times Book Review ). The Grand Master justifies the overwhelming acclaim he has received over the course of his remarkable career with an electrifying thriller that sends the indomitable Raylan racing to Italy on the trail of a fugitive bookie who s hiding from the vengeful Miami mob. The legendary Leonard, whom the Seattle Times lauds as the King Daddy of crime writers, proves that all comparisons to American noir icons John D. MacDonald, Dashiell Hammett, and James M. Cain are well deserved with this tale of very dirty doings and extremely dangerous men coming together in the birthplace of Puccini, Garibaldi, and La Cosa Nostra.
