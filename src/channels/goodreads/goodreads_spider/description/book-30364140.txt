30364140:::::Piper Perish:::::Now is the time for fearlessness. Who are you now? Piper Perish inhales air and exhales art. The sooner she and her best friends Enzo and Kit can get out of Houston and get into art school in New York City, the better. It s been Piper s dream her whole life, and now that senior year is halfway over, she s never felt more ready. Who will you become? But in the final months before graduation, life s got Piper a little more breathless. Things are weird with Kit and awful with Enzo; art school is looking increasingly impossible; three different guys have each claimed a different piece of Piper s heart; and Piper s sister s tyrannical mental state seems to thwart every attempt at happiness for the Perish family. Piper s art just might be enough to get her out. But is she strong enough and brave enough to seize that power, even if it means giving up what she s always known? Be now. Then be bow. Be now, now, now.
