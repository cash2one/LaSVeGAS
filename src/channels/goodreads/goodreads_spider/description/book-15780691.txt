15780691:::::De domdas o:::::In the summer of 1946, while secluded in August Strindberg s small cabin in the Stockholm archipelago, Stig Dagerman wrote Island of the Doomed. This novel was unlike any other yet seen in Sweden and would establish him as the country s brightest literary star. To this day it is a singular work of fiction a haunting tale that oscillates around seven castaways as they await their inevitable death on a desert island populated by blind gulls and hordes of iguanas. At the center of the island is a poisonous lagoon, where a strange fish swims in circles and devours anything in its path. As we are taken into the lives of each castaway, it becomes clear that Dagerman s true subject is the nature of horror itself.Island of the Doomed is a chilling profile of terror and guilt and a stunning exploration written under the shadow of the Nuremberg Trials of the anxieties of a generation in the postwar nuclear age.
