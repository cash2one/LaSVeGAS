28588435:::::The Ipswich Bus:::::A collection of extraordinary poems for ordinary people, written by Robbie, a fairly ordinary but talented man. If you like your poetry complicated, then this is not the book for you. Robbie writes in a way that is both heart-warming and relatable. But be prepared for both laughter and tears along the way. All or any proceeds from the sale of this book will be donated directly to "The Ipswich Outreach Bus Project", which is a small charity aiming to raise money to buy and convert a bus which will be utilised to help the homeless and those in need. http://www.ipswichoutreachbus.co.uk/
