179436:::::Best Thing in Life is a Friend:::::Friends are often the ones you turn to when all else fails. If family and relationship problems surface, friends are there to comfort and protect you. In choosing your friendships, you learn more about yourself. What is important to you? What do you value the most in life? Who is your role model? These questions often lead to a closeness that only a friend can understand. A friendship is an innocent love, marred by nothing, and open to all types of expression. Real friendship is a relationship that never ends, a bond that never breaks, and a trust that grows with time. Sometimes, the best thing in life is a friend.
