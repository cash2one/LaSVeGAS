35503464:::::Where it all Began:::::Available only through Lucy's newsletter, this free book is the prequel to the popular Blue Moon series and is set in 1985. John Pierce has plans for these two hundred rundown acres. He sees a farm, a family, a future. He s not about to drag someone in on the ground floor, not before he s put in the work to turn rubble into home. The grad student he agreed to take on for the summer was supposed to lend a hand. Hell, he was supposed to be a man. Not an opinionated, smart-mouthed woman who does nothing but distract him from dawn to dusk. She s ruining his nice, quiet life. And he can t wait for her to finish her thesis and get out of his hair.
