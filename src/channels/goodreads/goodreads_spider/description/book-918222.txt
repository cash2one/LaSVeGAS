918222:::::Strategy:::::The classic book on strategy by one of the foremost military thinkers of the twentieth century, Strategy draws on all of military history, from the Greek-Persian wars of the fifth century B.C. to the development of geurrilla warfare in the nuclear age. Liddell Hart provides a perceptive and fascinating examination of wars and their architects. He shows how Hitler almost won, and ultimately lost, World War II, and defines practical principles - "Adjust your end to your means," "Take a line of operation which offers alternate objectives" - that are as fundamental in the worlds of politics and business as they are in warfare. This extraordinary work should be essential reading for anyone fascinated by military history and strategy.
