1235403:::::Gladys Aylward: The Adventure of a Lifetime:::::Without formal education or a missionary organization to back her, a housemaid from England dared to answer God's call to China. What follows is an amazing adventure of faith and determination. Gladys Aylward (1902-1970) 'Ai-weh-deh' went on to become one of the greatest Christian missionaries in China and a revered figure risking her life to help orphans, prisoners and those in need. At one time she assisted the Chinese government as a "foot inspector" discouraging the practice of footbinding in young Chinese girls. During an invasion by Japanese forces, Aylward led over 200 orphans to safety over the mountains. Her story was made into the Hollywood film 'The Inn of the Sixth Happiness,' starring Ingrid Bergman.
