20419910:::::Guns: The Spencer Book:::::THIS IS NOT A STANDALONE BOOK. YOU MUST READ ALL THE OTHER BOOKS IN THIS SERIES FIRST. Spencer Shrike is a man with a plan. Get in. Get out. Move on. He loves Ron the Bomb, and her safety is the only thing on his mind these days. But life is a tricky bastard, and conning criminals for the better part of ten years brings its own set of problems. Sure, Rook lied her way out of a sticky situation, covering for crimes Ronin, Ford, and Spencer committed, and getting them all off scot-free in the process. But not everyone is buying Rook s story, and Spencer is desperate to figure out who s in town setting them up for a fall. Veronica the Bombshell Vaughn has put up with Spencer Shrike s shit for years and where has it gotten her? A big fat nowhere. No ring, no house, no kids, and no promises. In fact, Spencer is worse than ever completely distant and moody. She s done sitting at home, pining over a man she can t have. But she s not opposed to fighting for him. Ron the Bomb fights hard and she fights dirty, so she s willing to do whatever it takes to get Spencer s attention. But now there s another man in town with his eye on her. He s got secrets too, but unlike Spencer, Bobby Mansi is more than willing to let Veronica in on them. The entire Rook and Ronin series comes full circle. Every con, every lie, and every skeleton in the closet is back for one final shot at vengeance and the only way to set it right is to get out the guns.
