4756029:::::Miss Fortune:::::They call her the "P.I. Princess." It s 1947 and Allie Fortune is the only female (and probably the best) private investigator in New York City. Her work is a welcome distraction from her own past, and she s just been hired on by a client who isn t telling the whole truth. Mary Gordon s claims of innocence don t fit with her ransacked apartment, being shot at, and the two Soviet agents hot on her trail. Meanwhile, the FBI is working the case because a legendary and mysterious treasure has gone missing...again. The only catch for Allie is her new partner Jack, an attractive, single agent who knows how to make her smile. As Allie and Jack chase after the gold, they must contend with the Soviets, who also want the priceless treasure back--after all, they stole it fair and square.
