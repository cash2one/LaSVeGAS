491858:::::Horse Whispers:::::The Saddle Club is spending February vacation with the Devines at the Bar None Ranch. Colonel Devine has just bought some new horses and one of the mares reminds Carole of Cobalt, the first horse she really loved. Carole rides the mare and discovers that, while the mare has been trained, there is still something wild in her. Then the mare runs away. The Saddle Club finds her running with a herd of wild horses that lives on the Bar None land. They bring the mare back. She runs away again. They bring her back again, only to have her run away once more. Eventually, The Saddle Club and the Devines must face the fact that the mare wants to be in the wild--and that she belongs there. Carole's encounter with this free spirit teaches her something about herself, too. She has a very special talent--she's a natural horse whisperer.
