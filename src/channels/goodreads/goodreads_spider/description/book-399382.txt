399382:::::The Lives and Times of Jerry Cornelius: Stories of the Comic Apocalypse:::::Jerry Cornelius English assassin, physicist, rock star, messiah to the Age of Science is one of fantastic literature s greatest creations. Acclaimed by Moorcock s readers, critics, and peers from Mick Jagger to J. G. Ballard, Cornelius is the ultimate postmodern antihero, more Borgesian than Asimovian. Three of the stories in this collection are here anthologized for the first time: The Spencer Inheritance, which enmeshes Jerry with Princess Di; Cheering for the Rockets, involving an attack on a Sudanese pharmaceutical plant; and Firing the Cathedral, a novella based on 9/11 and its aftermath.
