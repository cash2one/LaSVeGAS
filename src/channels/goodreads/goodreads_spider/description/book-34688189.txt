34688189:::::Bedbug's Writing: A Collection of Short Stories + Poetry, Volume One:::::With a mix of heart, humor, and a little darkness, Tony Lovell explores the perseverance of love in the face of unfortunate circumstances, death and the ghosts that won t leave us alone, literal and metaphorical rebellion against that which is perceived as normalcy, and more in this collection of short stories and poetry. Many of the pieces may have originally been written for writing challenges on websites such as Grammar Ghoul Press, while others have either never previously been shared or were shared in limited capacity, yet each story stands alone as a work of love and passion and displays the illusion of capability that Tony possesses. There s a little something for everyone in Bedbug s Writing!
