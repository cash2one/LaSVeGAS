17656909:::::Junkie Love:::::From the cow fields of Connecticut to the streets of San Francisco, Joe Clifford s Junkie Love traverses the lost highways of America, down the rocky roads of mental illness to the dead ends of addiction. Based on Clifford s own harrowing experience with drugs as a rock n roll wannabe in the 1990s, the book draws on the best of Kerouac &amp; the Beats, injecting a heavy dose of pulp fiction as it threads a rollicking narrative through a doomed love triangle, lit up by the many strange characters he meets along the way. Part road story, part resurrection tale, Junkie Love finds a way to laugh in one s darkest hour, while never abandoning its heart in search of a home.
