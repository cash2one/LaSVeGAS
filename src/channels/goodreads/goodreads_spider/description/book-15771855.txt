15771855:::::Normal for Norfolk:::::Pub landlords are being murdered in Norfolk! Thelonious T. Bear, ursine photojournalist, leaves behind the big city life of London to take an assignment in the Norfolk countryside, where he hopes to find the real England. Instead he stumbles upon gastro-pubs, crazed Audi drivers and murder. As the hapless Thelonious keeps ending up in the wrong place at the wrong time, he attracts the attention of Detective Chief Inspector Horatio Sidebottom of Norfolk Constabulary CID, who s determined to tie Thelonious to the crimes. Add in a pair of hoods from London s East End, celebrity TV chef Paolo Louis Black, and plenty of oddball local characters and it all adds up to a madcap journey through England s most quirky county, where everything is normal for Norfolk! From bestselling author Mitzi Szereto, co-authored with her celebrity sidekick bear Teddy Tedaloo. For anyone who s ever wondered what Paddington at Large would have been like if it had been written by Raymond Chandler and who hasn t? Mitzi Szereto has the answer. Like Philip Marlowe, Szereto s Thelonious T. Bear is a modern knight errant who plays it cool even as the light of suspicion shines on him. And like Paddington, he s short of stature and long on charm. If you like your sleuths tough, cynical and cute as a button, Normal for Norfolk is the book for you. Steve Hockensmith, author of Holmes on the Range and Pride and Prejudice and Zombies: Dawn of the Dreadfuls Normal for Norfolk has it all: magic, gritty realism, humor, cultural commentary, intelligence, charm, and suspense. The hero of this novel, Thelonious T. Bear, finds himself at the heart of a mystery. He s a photojournalist like no other, a pub-loving, anthropomorphized bear who wears cologne and a deerstalker hat. I am eager to read the next book in Mitzi Szereto s series.
