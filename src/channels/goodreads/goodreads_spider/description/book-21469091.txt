21469091:::::The Queen of Bright and Shiny Things:::::Sage Czinski is trying really hard to be perfect. If she manages it, people won t peer beyond the surface, or ask hard questions about her past. She s learned to substitute causes for relationships, and it s working just fine until Shane Cavendish strolls into her math class. He s a little antisocial, a lot beautiful, and everything she never knew she always wanted. Shane Cavendish just wants to be left alone to play guitar and work on his music. He s got heartbreak and loneliness in his rearview mirror, and this new school represents his last chance. He doesn t expect to be happy; he only wants to graduate and move on. He never counted on a girl like Sage. But love doesn t mend all broken things, and sometimes life has to fall apart before it can be put back together again
