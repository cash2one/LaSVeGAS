38054:::::Never Die Alone:::::King David never let anything stand in his way, as he clawed his way out of the mean streets. If it took busting an old lady's head open with a Coke bottle for her last dollar, so be it. Mixing battery acid with cocaine to gain revenge was acceptable, too. Whatever it took. Then he made it big--only to find others had not forgotten, had no intention of forgiving. They came after him. He left behind a Cadillac and a diary, left it to a writer Donald Goines called "Paul Pawlowski." Like all Goines' novels, Never Die Alone is based on truth. "He lived by the code of the streets and his books vividly recreated the street jungle and its predators." -- New Jersey Voice
