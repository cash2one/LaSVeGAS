27844605:::::Nineteen Letters:::::Braxton Nineteen. There s something about that number; it not only brought us together, bonding us forever, it also played a hand in tearing us apart. The nineteenth of January 1996. I ll never forget it. It was the day we met. I was seven and she was six. It was the day she moved in next door, and the day I developed my first crush on a girl. Exactly nineteen years later, all my dreams came true when she became my wife. She was the love of my life. My soul mate. My everything. The reason I looked forward to waking up every morning. Then tragedy struck. Nineteen days after we married, she was in an accident that would change our lives forever. When she woke from her coma, she had no memory of me, of us, of the love we shared. I was crushed. She was my air, and without her I couldn t breathe. The sparkle that once glistened her eyes when she looked at me was gone. To her, now, I was a stranger. I had not only lost my wife, I had lost my best friend. But I refused to let this tragedy be the end of us. That s when I started to write her letters, stories of our life. Of when we met. About the happier times, and everything we had experienced together. What we had was far too beautiful to be forgotten.
