13122386:::::Dream Traveler:::::When high school student Jamie Richards falls asleep she s bounced through time into the future. This future shows a horrifying conclusion. 300,000 years from today, advanced spirits called Phelastians are finally making peace with ape-like creatures called Dwellers. Formality requires a twenty-first century human be present as witness to the signing of the treaty. They recruit Jamie. When a Dweller overlord sabotages the celestial link connecting Jamie to her real time, she vanishes from the signing, crumbles the negotiations, and flies off on a series of mind-bending, alternate-reality journeys. She has one chance to make things right, a desperate gamble that will either save the universe or destroy everything going forward from the beginning of time.
