6111959:::::The Crew:::::Deception, double-cross, violence, and racism are all part of this tale of crime, football hooliganism, and lengths to which two men on opposite sides of the law will go to achieve their own aims Appearances can be deceiving, as Paul Jarvis of the National Soccer Intelligence Unit is only too well aware. He knows that Billy Evans is no ordinary Cockney lad made good. He's also a thug, a villain, and a cop killer, Jarvis just hasn't been able to prove it yet. So when Jarvis discovers that Evans is putting together a hooligan "Super Crew" to follow England's national soccer team to Italy, he feels sure he can finally put Evans behind bars, if only someone can infiltrate the group and get him the proof he needs. But nothing is ever that simple. The Crew believe Evans is just out for a full-on riot. Jarvis thinks he's trafficking drugs. But Billy Evans is always one step ahead. He has another plan. And it will be catastrophic for everyone concerned, except him.
