25935780:::::No Way Out:::::When Lanaya Smith and Cara Gates wake up in an unknown building, with no memory of their lives, they quickly realize it's due to more than just amnesia. After they stumble across a power no one thought existed, they escape together, and are quickly thrust into a life they didn't know they had. They learn about their lives but something still seems missing. Constantly on the run, they attempt to dig into their past and find out who put them there. They soon discover that sometimes the truth is better kept a secret, and that sometimes the difference between the truth and lies can be life or death.
