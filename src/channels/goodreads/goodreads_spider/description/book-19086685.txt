19086685:::::Arena Mode:::::The Arena Mode Saga has over 500 Five-Star Reviews across Amazon and Goodreads, and is Kickstarter's #1 selling science-fiction series of all time. In his twenty-nine years, Matthew Moxon had done virtually nothing with his record-breaking IQ and unparalleled problem solving abilities. Until one morning, after a dangerous fall lands him in the emergency room, he discovers that a tumor is pressing against his brain. Unable to afford experimental but potentially life-saving surgery, Moxon takes drastic action; he volunteers for Arena Mode: 2041's most vicious sporting event, where thirteen superhumans fight in an urban combat zone for a multi-billion dollar prize. Moxon is forced to battle opponents possessing ungodly speed, strength, and abilities once thought to exist only across the pages of superhero comics - and he's armed with nothing more than his rapidly-diminishing brain cells. With the odds stacked impossibly against him, Moxon fights to not only survive the wrath of the other competitors, but to unlock the mysteries buried within the Arena itself. Discover the series that has been nominated for the prestigious BSFA Award ( Arena Mode , Best Novel of 2013), has been ranked #1 on Amazon in the US and the UK ( Arena Mode , Superhero and Dystopian categories, May 2015) and is currently part of the high school curriculum in the state of Florida.
