Kevin's attributes, which would be appreciated by most women, are considered to be boring, routine and predictable to Brenda. Brenda has a wild and insatiable side she feeds by frequently going out on manhunts seeking new conquests. Once amused and satisfied, she returns to Kevin who welcomes her back with open arms hoping she?ll finally commit. But was there always more to Brenda than meets the eye? Was Brenda's immoral behavior lying dormant and then suddenly awakened upon meeting Kevin? Will Kevin ever experience the love and respect he desires and deserves from Brenda? Or will he remain a helpless victim of Brenda's sorted and twist lifestyle?
