17980328:::::Beautiful Broken Rules:::::What happens when you create rules to keep others out? One thing Emerson Moore has come to terms with is that she is the school slut. She knows her way around a frat house and how to get what she wants. She doesn t make any excuses for her actions and she doesn t pretend to be anything different. She is who she is and with that she knows how to have a good time. She s made rules to keep relationships at bay and avoid the demons of her past. When her best friend, Cole has his two friends from back home move in with him she begins to think she has met her match with Jaxon Riley. Jax is the perfect mixture of tattooed muscle and a sweet-talking mouth. With hand written notes, a voice that exudes sex and knowing just how to get under her skin, Jaxon learns how to break all the rules. But will he just end up breaking her heart anyway?
