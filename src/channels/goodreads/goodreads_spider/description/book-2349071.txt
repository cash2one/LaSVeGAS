"Remember, it is possible to change the future." "What happens after everyone dies?" "The Tarnacki take their forces to planet Kripicon. A galactic warrior from Kripicon is already trained." "Sounds like your Council doesn't think I've got much of a chance." "The Council has the utmost belief in your abilities, but must also prepare other civilizations for the possibility of failure. The outcome of your assignment affects more than you can possibly understand. The fate of your world--perhaps all worlds--rests on you." Night after night, thirteen-year-old Tim Madison is haunted by visions of aliens and destruction. His simple life is turned upside down when he discovers the horrifying truth. The dreams are true, and part of his Galactic Warrior training. Now he's in a race against time as something deadly grows inside Earth--but it may be too late.
