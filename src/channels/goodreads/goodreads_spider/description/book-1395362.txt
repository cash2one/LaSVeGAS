1395362:::::The Thing About Jane Spring: A Novel:::::The thing about Jane Spring is...at thirty-one, he has everything a woman could ask for and seemingly everything a man could long for-great legs, brains, rising star status in the Manhattan D.A.'s office-but she just can't find a man who'll fall madly in love with her. Men are always asking her out, but for some reason no one wants a second date. So what if she's neck-breakingly assertive and somewhat callous? This is the twenty-first century. Right? Maybe not. But what is it that men really want in a woman after all? One snowy night after a bottle of wine and a Doris Day marathon on cable, it hits her: Doris Day always got her man. So Jane Springs trades in her nondescript black pantsuit and clunky diver's watch for pastel pink suits with pearls and pumps, she changes her hair, stops cursing, starts wearing makeup, sweetens her mannerisms and redecorates her whole apartment. And soon her life really does begin to change: Not only does her lazy secretary start working, but everyone seems to be kinder and gentler-and she's got men lining up around the block. But can she keep her inner attack dog on hold long enough to win the most important case of her career...and the man of her dreams? Sharon Krum's magical and hilariously funny novel is a delightful romantic comedy about a driven young woman who must shed her rough exterior and embrace her inner ultrafemininity in order to truly find herself and, eventually, true love.
