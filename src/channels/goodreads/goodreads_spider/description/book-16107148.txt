16107148:::::Torn:::::Find Max. That s all Layla cares about. Not healing from the Fomore attack. Not finding answers to how she survived a fall that nearly killed her. Nothing will stop her. She will find him. She ll even pair up with an overbearing Fallen Angel who s hell bent on making everything harder than it needs to be if she has to. Protect Layla. For Max, nothing else matters. Not the bruises covering his body. Not the pain radiating from his broken bones. Not even his hands tied behind his back. He will find a way to save Layla, and the Fomore will pay if they ve hurt her. Every. Single. One of them. In the second installment of The Fire Born trilogy, a new breed of villain looms one Layla and Max will never suspect, and this killer has nothing to lose. Better yet, with Max and Layla s deaths, victory is in the grip of the enemy. Will Max and Layla find each other in time, or is it already too late for them both?
