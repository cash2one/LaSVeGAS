707225:::::The Boy Who Saw True: The Time-Honoured Classic of the Paranormal:::::He asked me if I believed in ghosts. And I said, yes. Then he wanted to know if I'd ever seen one, and I said, lots. 'Weren't you afraid?' 'Not when they're nice ghosts,' said I, 'but I don't like nasty ones ...' ' The Boy Who Saw True differs from all the hundreds of books I have read on Spiritualism and kindred subjects,' writes the celebrated occultist Cyril Scott in his preface to this remarkable work. 'Not one of them has ever displayed the characteristics of this highly diverting human document, with its na ve candours, its unconscious humour, its oscillations between the ridiculous and the exalted, and its power to convince, for the very reason that the young diarist never set out with the intention of convincing. Here was a precocious young boy born with clairvoyance who could see auras and spirits, yet failed to realise that other people were not similarly gifted.' This is the Victorian diary of a boy whose extraordinary supernatural talent unfurls within these pages. A compelling read, The Boy Who Saw True is a time-honoured classic of the paranormal.
