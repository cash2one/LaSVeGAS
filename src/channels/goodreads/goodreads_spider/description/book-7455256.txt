7455256:::::Darelles Trinity:::::Darelle was brought across by the world's oldest vampire, yet she retained her soul. Terrified by her sire's obsession with her, she escapes him and is rescued by two gorgeous Roman warriors. Not only do they rescue her, but Kane and Gareth claim to be her guardians, fellow vampires of her breed, sworn to pleasure, love and protect her for eternity. True to their word, they shower her with erotic pleasures beyond imagining, their union strengthening them against the forces they must face. For an evil far greater than her sire's lust awaits them all.
