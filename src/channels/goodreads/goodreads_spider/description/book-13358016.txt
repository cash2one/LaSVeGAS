13358016:::::Gastien: From Dream To Destiny:::::I am Gastien Beauchamp, artist and lover. Any Frenchman would tell you that a peasant could never own property in nineteenth century France. Yet here I am, in my very own studio. The personal cost was horrendous. I barely survived the choices I made, and my sanity was pushed to its limits. Still, I finally now have security, peace, and freedom. For the rest of my life I can spend time making love to the color , making love to beautiful women, and enjoying the wild nightlife of bohemian Montmartre. What more could a man need or want? Then, one night, I see her. One look at Sophie, and my heart wants to betray me! I try to tell myself that I know better. Who needs love, anyway? I am already married-to my art! No woman would ever understand and accept my lifestyle; nor am I about to give that lifestyle up. Not when I paid so dearly for it! Besides, I am too badly damaged to ever open up my heart and if Sophie found out about my past she would not want to even know my name. I can t take that chance. I have had enough pain to last me a lifetime.
