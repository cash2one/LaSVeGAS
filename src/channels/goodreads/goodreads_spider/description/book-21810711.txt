21810711:::::The Purple Rift:::::At the start of the 22nd century, a race of godlike beings--the Elar--awaken after countless eons of slumber, and decide the purpose of their existence is to subdue all other life forms. On Earth, humankind has seemingly evolved into one peaceful, prosperous society--but in fact, it is only the calm before the storm. For "God" and "the Devil" are actually real, and have begun appointing human agents to oppose each other with unprecedented powers. And out in space, a mysterious "rift" has suddenly appeared, and soon alien spaceships emerge from it to head straight for Earth.

If it is not mended, soon there will be chaos beyond imagining; in fact, even life and death may cease to have meaning. The only hope for salvation rests with several young men and women who learn they have the unique, awesome ability to channel Spiritual Energy, also known as the Blood of the Universe. With this power, they must find a way to close the Purple Rift, thus restoring balance. There is just one problem: as long as the Rift exists, the Channellers are prevented from being able to control their power...
