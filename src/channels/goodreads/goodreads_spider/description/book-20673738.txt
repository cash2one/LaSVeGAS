20673738:::::Submerge:::::"Ever heard the saying when you assume, you make an 'ass' out of 'u' and 'me'? Yeah, keep that in mind the next time you judge a person before truly getting to know them. You might've heard some fragments of my story, but you don't know me. You don't know where I've come from, or how I got here; you merely scratched the surface of this nutty package. If you're brave, enter the world of my crazy." What do you do when the life you had planned is snatched away before it can begin? Do you give in, and let yourself succumb to the misery that tries to drown you, or do you attempt to swim to the surface that forever seems out of reach? If you're like me, you rely on the strength of those you care about and allow them to boost you up when you're down. But what happens when they're no longer around to support you? What happens when you're at your lowest point, and there's no one left to lend you a helping hand? The world may have ended, mine just took a little longer to catch up. I've lost people along the way, some I loved; others I didn't, but the one I've really lost is myself. How, then, can I find the will to go on when all I see is a stranger in the mirror? How do I force myself to breathe when it's so much easier to just wait for something to come and mercifully finish me off? The answer: I'll let you know when I figure it out. ****Warning: this novel contains graphic violence, abuse, strong language, and sexual content (both consensual and rape).
