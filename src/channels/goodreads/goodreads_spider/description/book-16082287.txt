16082287:::::Confessions of an Alli Cat:::::Thirty-five year-old Allison Alli Lancaster has it all a fabulous job, a beautiful 15 year-old daughter, a hilarious BFF and a gorgeous house with a pool and Jacuzzi in an exclusive Las Vegas neighborhood. What she doesn t have is a husband, because she kicked her lousy, cheating ex to the curb nine months ago. Since then, Alli has paid her dues with seemingly endless self-improvement and seemingly endless mourning. Now she s ready to move on and try new things. Alli s idea of trying new things is nothing like that devil-of-a-best-friend of hers. Somehow, Sara, the devil of a best friend, talks Alli into trying out a sex toy, sleeping with a younger man and letting a stranger in a lab jacket put hot wax on a place that should never, ever, ever see wax. And that s only the beginning. Alli never saw her life going quite like this. She also never thought she d meet someone else who had the very real potential to change her life forever. But she did. Enter the new guy. He s gorgeous, refined and mature. He s also marriage material. But that poses a problem for Alli, who renounced the institution of marriage when she renounced her ex. What s a girl to do? They say that what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas. But what the heck happens when you can t leave Vegas? Well, you spin the wheel, of course. You play the game and let the chips fall where they may. Alli just hopes she can find them all. ******* Caution!
