16078602:::::ApocalypseThirdEdition:::::Now with a Special Guest Preface,the details praised by fans of `Magicians Code` and `Precoded` are meshed together in a blockbuster narrative,showing how they affect events as far apart in time and distance as the English,USA &amp; Spanish Civil Wars as well as the two World Wars and events right down to the present day and the prospect of economic and environmental ruin. The widely different approaches of art,religion and science are brought together in a unique way to show how our health, wealth and safety-to the degree of our very survival- have been alarmingly compromised,and the way that even certain `sciences` are influenced without it ever being admitted to. It might all seem mysterious,even miraculous, if it were not so clearly explained with disarming simplicity.
