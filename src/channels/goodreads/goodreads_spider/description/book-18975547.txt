18975547:::::Voluptuous Vindication:::::Once upon a time, the world was just a black void. Then one day man came, but he wasn't alone. He was followed by an ancient evil, a scourge determined to steal his soul. Centuries passed. Humanity did all it could to protect itself against the evil ones, but they weren't equipped to fight this battle. Instead, all they could do was pray that Hell didn't set its eyes upon them. It got to be too much. Something had to be done. Born out of desperate need, warriors were chosen. Immortality was granted to those strong enough to fight the battle that would never end. No longer mortal, these men have stood in the path of dark and horrifying evil, bearing the load when there was nobody else that could. It's all coming to an end. Time has ran out for humanity... No good deed goes unpunished... Ian Bauer was the Endurer that had it all. With great looks and plenty of money, he had never regretted his immortality... But fate had other plans for him. Reeling from a tragic event, he's forced back into the fight between good and evil when demons set their sights on an mortal angel. He has to keep her alive for four weeks, something easier said than done. Ian never counted on the wicked attraction that flares up between them.
