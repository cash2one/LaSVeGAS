2842492:::::The Cult of the Presidency: America's Dangerous Devotion to Executive Power:::::The Bush years have justifiably given rise to fears of a new Imperial Presidency.

Interweaving historical scholarship, legal analysis, and cultural commentary, The Cult of the Presidency argues that the Presidency needs to be reined in, its powers checked and supervised, and its wartime authority put back under the oversight of the Congress and the courts. Only then will we begin to return the Presidency to its proper constitutionally limited role.
