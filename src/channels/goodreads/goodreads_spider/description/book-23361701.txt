23361701:::::Bright Side:::::Secrets. Everyone has one. Some are bigger than others. And when secrets are revealed Some will heal you. And some will end you. Kate Sedgwick s life has been anything but typical. She s endured hardship and tragedy, but she remains consistently optimistic (there s a reason her best friend, Gus, calls her Bright Side). She s strong-willed, funny, musically gifted, and smart. She s also never believed in love. So when Kate leaves her hometown of San Diego for college in the small town of Grant, Minnesota the last thing she expects to find is Keller Banks. The attraction is immediate. And intense. And mutual. But each of them has a reason to fight it. A secret. Secrets. Some will heal you And some will end you
