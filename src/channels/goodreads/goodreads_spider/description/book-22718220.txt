She did something drastic and jumped in front of a loaded gun for the one she knew she couldn t lose. And with her mother s last request, she did more than fall in love. She fell into Declan O Callaghan with her eyes wide open and her damaged heart and soul leading the way. When Irish-born Declan O Callaghan spotted Amberlyn across the lake, he knew his life was about to change. And it did. Now he has everything he s ever dreamed of he s marrying for love, and with that love, the family distillery will now be his as long as he marries before the deadline. Things are moving fast. It s now or never. And as their beautiful relationship grows, time is something these two don t have a lot of. Declan s and Amberlyn s souls are tightly tethered, but will the questions and second thoughts of others prevent them from having a life they ve both only begun to dream of? Will family and the obligations that come with the O Callaghan name push them to their breaking point? Or has the Whiskey Prince truly found his happily ever after taking Amberlyn as his Princess?
