As a hurricane approaches, most of the island's permanent residents evacuate, but not Dibber, who has plundering on his mind. While rummaging through Inez Marchand's house, Dibber finds more than he expected-a dead body. Charged with murder, he turns to Mike Connolly for help. It's up to Mike to untangle a web of secrets no one else will touch.
