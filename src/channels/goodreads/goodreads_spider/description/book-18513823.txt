18513823:::::How to invite people to Allah:::::Why is it important to invite people to the faith of Allah? How can sinners be involved in tackling evil and promoting good? These are some of the questions posed and answered by the learned Shaykh Muhammad Al- Arifi. He substantiates and qualifies his arguments with examples from the Qur'an, Sunnah and the lives of the Salaf - the pious predecessors. He shows how guidance for others can come in the form of a kind word, letter and even a tape recording. He demonstrates how this is one of the best ways to help lost souls and gain blessings from Almighty Allah.
