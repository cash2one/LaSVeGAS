2332157:::::Eve of Chaos:::::How do you tell Satan that you ran over his dog? Evangeline Hollis has no idea, and she doesn t want to find out. She d rather forget the Infernal that nearly wiped out her training class and killed some of the best demonhunting Marks in the world. Living with the Mark of Cain and the two sexy brothers who come with it is trouble enough. Satan has put a bounty on Eve s head, and Hell s denizens are converging on Southern California. The Infernals are complicating Eve s hunts and creating chaos in her once orderly life. They ve also brought her to the attention of an overzealous reverend who s certain she s Jezebel reincarnate.
