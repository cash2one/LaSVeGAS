1927226:::::The Circle of Stone:::::The ancient god Loki has been set free from the chains which bound him for centuries, and free to wreak terrible revenge. As Edmund and Elspeth desperately search for him, the fire and destruction they expect is nowhere to be seen. They discover instead strange emblems carved along the route south. Traveling ever closer toward the war between the Visigoths and the English, Edmond and Elspeth feel they are being drawn into a trap. But with the help of their friends, and faith in themselves they will face Loki one last time, at an ancient circle of stones that may be their last hope to defeat the terrible trickster.
