Six years ago, Hannah buried her twin sister. Now, with her family in jeopardy, Hannah must sell herself to a wealthy stranger in order to save their home. She expects to be scarred by the experience. She doesn't expect to pay penance for her sister's sins or to meet a man who brings her body savagely to life. Now Hannah must choose--confess to Jackson that she's not the twin he's looking for and forfeit the money she needs to survive, or submit to a man whose dark domination may be the end of them both. * *CLIFFHANGER ALERT: Dark Domination ends in a cliffhanger.
