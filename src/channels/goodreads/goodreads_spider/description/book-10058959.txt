The principal characters are a distinguished middle-aged French novelist, Guillaume Fontane; his possessive bourgeois wife, Pauline; and Lolita, a young Peruvian actress of great beauty and talent. The story begins and ends in Paris; in between the scene shifts to South America and the United States. September Roses is the work of an author who is a master of his craft; controlled and humane, it evinces a deep understanding of the subtleties of human experience.
