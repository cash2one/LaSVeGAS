18249406:::::And There Was Light: The Extraordinary Memoir of a Blind Hero of the French Resistance in World War II:::::When Jacques Lusseyran was an eight-year-old Parisian schoolboy, he was blinded in an accident. He finished his schooling determined to participate in the world around him. In 1941, when he was seventeen, that world was Nazi-occupied France. Lusseyran formed a resistance group with fifty-two boys and used his heightened senses to recruit the best. Eventually, Lusseyran was arrested and sent to the Buchenwald concentration camp in a transport of two thousand resistance fighters. He was one of only thirty from the transport to survive. His gripping story is one of the most powerful and insightful descriptions of living and thriving with blindness, or indeed any challenge, ever published. * Chosen as one of the 100 Best Spiritual Books of the Twentieth Century by a jury of writers including Harold Kushner, Thomas Moore, Huston Smith, and Natalie Goldberg * This fourth edition includes a new insert of photographs One of the most powerful memoirs I ve ever encountered...[Lusseyran s] experience is thrilling, horrible, honest, spiritually profound, and utterly full of joy. Ethan Hawke, in the Village Voice
