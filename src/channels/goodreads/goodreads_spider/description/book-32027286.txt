32027286:::::Raphael's Fling:::::This is an alternate cover edition for ASIN B01MG2ESS6 . I'm Mia, and I dream about publishing a book on medieval Paris. Except... I m better qualified for writing a manual on how to go from a budding scholar to a pregnant runaway in three easy steps. - - - My sister Eva carries a torch for the wrong man. Here s the gist of my sermons to her: Drooling over your hunky astronaut boss is a loser s trek to Calamity with three stops along the way: Heartbreak, Job Loss, and Spinsterhood. The thing is, I m in a terrible you could even say impossible position to lecture Eva. I m attracted to my own boss. Raphael d Arcy is funny, smart, and uber-rich. He s also smoking hot. That alone should have scared me away, were I not such a dolt, my academic achievements notwithstanding. But there s more. Raphael is France s most notorious playboy who doesn t do relationships. He does one-night stands. If sufficiently intrigued, he might do a fling. Which is the most I could ever hope to have with him a short-lived fling. So what , right? It s not the end of the world. But consider this: Getting my heart broken by Raphael d Arcy is the least of my worries. Some very serious merde has been piling up in my life lately. And it s about to hit the fan. RAPHAEL'S FLING is a sexy standalone romantic comedy. No cliffhangers. GUARANTEED: a swoony bad-boy hero, laugh-out-loud moments and a happily-ever-after.
