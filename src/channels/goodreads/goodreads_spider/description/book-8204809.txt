8204809:::::Kissing Steel:::::All Rena wanted was to steal back a spaceship and earn enough money to buy her freedom from her travesty of a life. Her mission to recover stolen property from pirates backfired and she became a possession when she encountered cyborgs instead. Now, one of them will own her. Rena is a survivor... and she wants the very tall, big, brutally sexy cyborg who doesn't like to share anything that belongs to him. Steel is beyond irritated when he is maneuvered into ownership of a fragile human female. She's not nearly big enough to handle his size or strength, yet she's determined to get him into bed-into her. Steel realizes just what this little female is capable of when he awakens, chained to his bed, with her riding his very turned-on body. For a man who prides himself on his unyielding control, Steel soon finds Rena stripping him of it an inch at a time.
