First, Nicholas, a would-be Living Artist, seeks to escape his demons in the shadowy underground but in doing so makes a deal with the devil himself. In her fevered search for him, his twin sister, Nicola, spins her own unusual and hypnotic tale as she discovers the hidden secrets of the city.

There he will find wonders beyond imagining and horrors greater than the heart can bear. By turns beautiful, horrifying, delicate, and powerful, Veniss Underground explores the limits of love, memory, and obsession in a landscape that defies the boundaries of the imagination. This special edition includes the short stories The Sea, Mendeho, and Moonlight ; Detectives and Cadavers ; and A Heart for Lucretia and the novella Balzac s War, offering a complete tour of the fantastic world of Veniss.
