15781230:::::The Becoming:::::It s not like sixteen-year-old Nathan Terras wants to be evil. A bad boy, maybe but not evil. Yeah, he can see auras but so what? He d gladly trade that talent for, say, a new Mustang or a little skin time with Scarlett Johansson. That is until a near-death experience reveals he s to become the Antichrist. Forget vampires, werewolves, and zombies. They re the lucky ones. THE. ANTICHRIST. And now his enemies are waking. They re coming for him, and they re not interested in a friendly game of Halo. But Nathan s developing some frightening defenses of his own. A violent power grows inside him. He d be thankful, if only the dark energy wasn t so addictive. When his little brother disappears, he ll do anything to get him back. Embracing his new identity may save his brother s life, but Nathan could lose his own in the process. The line between good and evil begins to blur, leaving Nathan wondering which side he s on.
