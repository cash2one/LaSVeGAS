1110713:::::Options: The Secret Life of Steve Jobs:::::Welcome to the mind, to the world of Fake Steve Jobs. Fake Steve the counterintuitive management guru: Obviously we can t literally put our employees lives at risk. But we have to make them feel that way. Fake Steve the political hobnobber: I can see why they keep Nancy Pelosi under wraps. Wacky as a dime watch. Fake Steve quoting friend/musician/philosopher Bono on road etiquette: Tink about dat next toim yer cuttin off some bloke and you don t know who it is, right? Could be Jay-sus. Or Boutros Boutros-Ghali or sumfin. And on, yes, himself: Geniuses have feelings, too. In the tradition of Thank You for Smoking and in the spirit of The Onion , Options is a novelistic sendup and takedown of Silicon Valley, Hollywood, and Washington, D.C., as viewed by a central character who exists, to his immense self-satisfaction, at the crossroads of all three worlds: It s like in one of those movies where a guy realizes he s got telekinetic powers and it s just too bad if he doesn t want them, he s got them. Likewise, I have this gift. It s who I am.
