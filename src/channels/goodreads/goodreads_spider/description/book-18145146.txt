18145146:::::The Day That Changed My Life - For the Rest of My Life:::::It's October 14, 2001, approximately 5:30 pm, and I am watching Sunday Night football. Unexpectedly, my breathing is getting shallow, my body is hot, and I'm sweating. I can feel my body getting weaker, I'm light-headed. Am I going to faint? I try calling my sister, but I can't talk. Finally, she walks into the room and she looks at me, I'm gasping for air, call 9-1-1. Five days later, I wake up, and I write my family a note: What happened? Did I die? They have no answers. God, help me! What happened?! Did I really die?
