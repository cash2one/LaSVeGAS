21063639:::::Obligation:::::[ob-li-gey-shuh n] An obligation is a course of action that someone is required to take, whether legal or moral. At six years old, Myla was sent to a family her father and mother had chosen for her when they knew their time on earth was almost up. What they were unaware of was what they thought would be her safe haven would become her living hell. Kai has been watching Myla from afar since he took over the family business from his father and inherited the responsibility of keeping her safe. When word gets back to Kai that Myla is not only in danger, but that his assets are being compromised, he immediately jumps into action and does the only thing that can be done at the time by marrying her. Neither Myla nor Kai would have thought that something that started off as a farce would become the most important thing either of them could've ever done.
