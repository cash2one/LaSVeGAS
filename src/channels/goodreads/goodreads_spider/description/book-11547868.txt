11547868:::::In Too Deep:::::He casually agrees to a marriage of convenience... never expecting to fall in love with his bride. Ethan Kincaid proposes marriage with the same detachment he gives every decision. Audra Gilliland accepts his proposal so she can stop being a burden to her newly married stepdaughter. But Ethan never expected Audra to affect him so profoundly, and it terrifies him. Someone he loved was once seriously injured on his watch, and he won't let that happen again. If Audra will just do as he says, he can keep her safe from the dangers that lurk on the ranch. Audra has been cared for all her life by one man or another and they've done a poor job of it. Now she's planning to stand up for herself. And her new husband had better agree or get out of her way! Can two fearful hearts wary of getting in too deep become two trusting hearts, willing to let go and fall in love?
