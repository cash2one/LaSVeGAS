288501:::::In Search of Fatima: A Palestinian Story:::::An intimate and powerful narrative in which the Israel-Palestine conflict is presented, unusually, from the Palestinian side, In Search of Fatima reflects the author s personal experiences of displacement, loss and nostalgia against a backdrop of the major political events which have shaped Middle East conflict. In Search of Fatima is a powerful biographical story, but it is also a book which transcends its author s own experience. It speaks for the millions of people all over the world who have lived suspended between their old and new countries, fitting into neither. An account not of the physical hardship and abuse suffered by many refugees, but rather an exploration of the subtler privations of psychological displacement and loss of identity.
