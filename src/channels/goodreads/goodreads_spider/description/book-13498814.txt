13498814:::::An Old Black Marble:::::One day I looked into the mirror and I was old. I looked out the window and saw that I was rich. I looked at my family and saw that it was good. I looked at my life and saw that it was full, but when I looked back in the mirror all that I could see was an impostor, a phantom, and the phantom was dying from a cancer...
