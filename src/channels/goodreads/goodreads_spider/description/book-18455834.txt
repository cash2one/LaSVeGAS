Jeff's past left him scarred. Literally. He wants nothing more than a fresh start and to leave the memories behind. A new town and a new job seem to be exactly what he needs to move forward. Brutus has never known love. Tortured and beaten since he was a puppy, he trusts no one, but when two men come into his life, he finds that not everyone is out to hurt him. Fate brought them together, can love keep them there?
