1408821:::::Life as It Comes:::::Sisters with nothing in common? That's Mado and Patty. Studious and responsible, 15-year-old Mado is the family brain. Patty, on the other hand, is a carefree 20-year-old party girl who lives on her own and has plenty of boyfriends. The two are following divergent paths . . . until their parents die in a car accident and a family court judge reluctantly appoints Patty as her sister's guardian. Now these two improbable siblings face the challenges of growing up together but it's Mado who quickly assumes the big sister's role. And it's not a role she particularly wants especially after Patty announces that she's several months pregnant. . . . Anne-Laure Bondoux writes with insight, humor, and poignancy about the bonds between sisters and the challenges of everyday life.
