6593530:::::A History of the Crusades, Volumes I, II and III:::::A re-issue of the classic history of the Crusades. So relevant. Some of the events -- from 900+ years ago -- read like they're fresh from today's headlines.The author says in his preface: "Whether we regard them as the most tremendous and most romantic of Christian adventures or as the last of the barbarian invasions, the Crusades form a central fact in medieval history. Before their inception the centre of our civilization was placed in Byzantium and in the lands of the Arab caliphate. Before they faded out the hegemony in civilization had passed to Western Europe. Out of this transference, modern history was born."
