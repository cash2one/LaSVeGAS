128461:::::A Season in Hell/The Drunken Boat:::::Although he stopped writing at the age of 19, Arthur Rimbaud (1854-91) possessed the most revolutionary talent of the century. His poetry &amp; prose have increasingly influenced major writers. To his masterpiece A Season in Hell is here added Rimbaud's longest &amp; possibly greatest single poem The Drunken Boat , with the original French en face Illuminations , Rimbaud's major works are available as bilingual New Directions Paperbooks. The reputation of A Season in Hell , which is a poetic record of a man's examination of his own depths, has steadily increased over the years. Upon the 1st publication of Varese's translation by New Directions, the Saturday Review wrote: "One may at last suggest that the translation of A Season in Hell has reached a conclusive point..." Concerning the 25-stanza The Drunken Boat , Dr Enid Starkie of Oxford University has written: "(It's) an anthology of separate lines of astonishing evocative magic which linger in the mind like isolated jewels." Rimbaud's life was so extraordinary that it has taken on the quality of a myth. A biographical chronology is included.
