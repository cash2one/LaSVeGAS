1104776:::::Promethea: Book One:::::The first graphic novel from America's Best Comics, like all titles from ABC, is written and created by Alan Moore, writer of Watchmen, the classic Swamp Thing, and V for Vendetta. Boasting some of Moore's most powerful writing in years, this volume introduces Promethea, a powerful figure who appeared in Victorian children's stories and turn-of-the-century comic strips and gains new life through Sophie Bangs, a college student in alternate-reality New York City. But as this exotic heroine leaps into battle, will Sophie's personality be able to reemerge when the battle is over?
