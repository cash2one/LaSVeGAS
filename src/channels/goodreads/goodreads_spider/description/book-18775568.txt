18775568:::::Cranford:::::Through the fictional Cranford, Elisabeth Gaskell depicts with ironic affection the people and old-fashioned customs and values of Knutsford, the small Chesshire town of her childhood. First published as a magazine serial from 1851 and then in novel form in 1853, Cranford is probably the best-known work by Elizabeth Gaskell.
