17667354:::::Poison, Perennials, and a Poltergeist:::::Darci Shelton has just one year to make her new flower shop a success, but she must come to terms with the store's resident ghost while struggling to put Petal Pushers in the black. Customers in the small Kentucky town keep Darci busy with flower arrangements and landscaping jobs. She also has to watch over her pregnant employee, and puts herself in jeopardy trying to help the sheriff crack a murder case. While all that's going on, the ghost heals puny plants, entertains the parakeet, and her cold spots keep the cooling bill down, but a dead woman who pops up beside floral displays just isn't good for business. Financial ups and downs are hard enough to deal with, plus Darci needs to find out what the apparition wants, before it scares everyone away . . . or worse.
