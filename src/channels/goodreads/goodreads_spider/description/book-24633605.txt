24633605:::::Always and Forever:::::Does wanting to slap the hell out of Brody Kelly make me a bad person? How about setting his hair on fire? No, I'm not a psycho. Yes, I AM angry. See, a year ago, my sweet and sexy firefighter boyfriend and I broke up over something extremely ridiculous. We'd been together since we were sophomores in high school, but that was the end of that. Almost twelve years of that, mind you. The looks he gives me tell me he still wants me. Our latest encounter has me thinking he's trying to win me back. But I'm not willing to give in so easily. I don't know why he used our argument as an excuse to break up, but I'm going to find out. I've lived in Serenity Point all my life and have connections and I m not afraid to use them to get to the bottom of things. What I am afraid of is finding something I won t be able to handle. He used to call me his Always and Forever. But the secrets he s keeping might tear us apart for good.
