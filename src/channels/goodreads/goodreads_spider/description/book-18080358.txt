18080358:::::Blade Heart:::::Because she trusted him the fate of the world is in her hands Icon of the United States of America, New York is Cara s city until one sunny afternoon when she wakes up in a beautiful meadow. Light clouds float in the blue sky, a mild breeze dances in the branches of a maple tree and the air smells of freshness. But New York has disappeared. When Cara opens her eyes, she finds a complete stranger standing too close for comfort and he seems to know all about her. If she wants to find her way back home she must stay with him. Obnoxious as he appears, she has to turn to him for protection when confronted with enemies she never knew she had. These enemies know of an ancient prophecy. They believe Cara is the only one who can change it and they will do anything to stop her. As Cara tries to outwit and outrun them, her heart starts to beat for the stranger. Only to discover that his heart is dead. BLADE HEART is a stand alone but takes place in the same world as THE LORD OF THE CLANS, a few months before THE LORD OF THE CLANS.
