8491354:::::Yes!:::::This title has been re-released under the title Instant Gratification, as part of the How I Met My Master collection. Can Andrew really spend twelve hours saying no to everything Stephen offers him? It s not going to be easy, when all he wants to say is - Yes! Andrew likes sex. If someone he s attracted to wants to have sex with him, he's not going to say no to them. That's not a character flaw, it s just common sense. Stephen seems to think otherwise. He's sure Andrew is incapable of saying no to a cheap thrill. But, at the same time, he's more than happy to provide Andrew with the prefect opportunity to prove him wrong. Andrew has no doubt that he can say no to everything the younger man offers him for the next twelve hours, and that's all he needs to do to win their bet. He's also quite looking forward to cutting the would-be dominant down to size in the process. Because, while he may be easy when it comes to vanilla encounters, Andrew has high standards when it comes to dominants. There's no way an inexperienced nineteen year old is going to receive his submission. Andrew will obviously find it easy to say no to that. Won't he ?
