17739407:::::I Never Asked You to Save Me:::::Ellie Mae Griggs-Heart is trying to escape, trying to find a place where she can finally be 'home'. She can't seem to shake her physically and emotionally abusive, soon to be ex-husband, Jake Heart. Refusing to take hand outs from her cousin Rhea Payne and her husband, former Navy SEAL Chad, Ellie has to moonlight at a job most would consider taboo to make ends meet. She lives day to day with the pain of a choice she made to try and be free of Jake. Navy SEAL sniper and notorious play-boy, Bobby Timmons, has never been the type to be tied down by a woman, filtering through them like it was his job. Ellie is different. She strikes a different chord and makes Bobby think twice about treating her like the other women in his past. He hates that she feels trapped by her ex, but as a SEAL his life is unpredictable and he is shipped off just as he's getting to know her. When tragedy and mistakes fill both of their lives, can they lean on each other for support? Or will their pasts destroy everything they could have had?
