Melody Carlson, bestselling author, Diary of a Teenage Girl series "A thought-provoking account of the battle of depression in a believer s life. It leaves no doubt that God is loving, merciful, and faithful." Nancy Moser, author, The Mustard Seed series Story Behind the Book Each of my novels is a piece of my heart. Where Yesterday Lives was my first-ever novel, and as such it is somewhat autobiographical. The childhood story of Ellen Barrett, her love for her parents and siblings, is my story though her current story and struggles are fictional. On Every Side sheds light on the struggle for religious freedom in today s climate; something I am passionate about. Finally, When Joy Came to Stay is the story of one woman s battle against depression and the secrets of her past. Karen Kingsbury
