25543022:::::Kick at the Darkness:::::To live through the zombie apocalypse they have to survive each other first. College freshman Parker Osborne is having the worst day ever. He humiliated himself trying to pick up a cute guy, he hasn t made any friends at school, and his stupidly hot jerk of a TA gave him a crappy grade on his paper. He s going to drop Adam Hawkins film class and start fresh tomorrow after he s had a good sulk. But Parker s about to find out what a bad day really looks like if he can survive the night. A virus is unleashed, transforming infected people into zombie-like killers. After these quick and deadly creepers swarm campus, Parker only escapes thanks to Adam swooping him onto the back of his trusty motorcycle. Now they're on the run and stuck with each other. When they re not bickering, they re fighting off the infected in a bloody battle for survival. Their only hope is to head east to Parker's family, but orphaned Adam has a secret he s not sure Parker will accept: he s a werewolf. Can they trust each other enough to find some light in these dark days?
