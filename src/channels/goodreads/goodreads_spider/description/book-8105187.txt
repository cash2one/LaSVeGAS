Although it s a paradise for some, Dr. Countryman has never felt more alone. As his fortieth birthday approaches, he reevaluates his past relationships and prays that God will guard his heart so it will not be broken again. If only there was a way he could be sure of God s will. God says that a man is not meant to live alone always. As a child, Shelley watched her mother lose the battle against breast cancer. In her late teens, she survived a major hurricane with her father while living in Southwest Florida. Now twenty-five, Shelley Roberts is a furniture repairwoman who believes in being prepared for every contingency while enjoying life and seizing the moment. A random encounter throws these two people into each other s lives. Soon after, Shelley is assigned to do some work at Mark s church. As they spend more time together, a relationship slowly begins to blossom, though whether they re friends or more is something neither of them is certain of. While growing closer to Mark, Shelley encourages him to prepare for the upcoming hurricane season something she had to learn to do some years before. Though a woman of faith, her life s experiences have taught her that preparation is necessary. She is enthusiastic in this belief, even when Mark tries to get her to relax and have faith in God s protection. Their beliefs will be tested when hurricane season begins in earnest and a storm grows in strength as it nears the Florida Peninsula. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Praise for An Unexpected Woman: Mark and Shelley complement each other well. She loosens him up a bit and he tempers her. In the beginning Shelley keeps a professional distance since Mark is considered a client. Mark has some reservations regarding their age difference and because of Shelley s delight in and insistence on their friendship. The progression of their relationship is sweet and believably Christian based. - IvyD for Manic Readers * * * One of my favourite things is when Mark and Shelley get cheeky with each other. Each knows how to keep the other from getting in a funk. And the flirting is awesome. There are some great romantic moments that are perfectly in keeping with godly conduct. - Jess Molly on Goodreads * * * The author also picks up on themes of family and friendship, as well as the need to compromise in any relationship. Overall, this was a satisfying read. Much in the tone of a Karen Kingsbury novel, this book should appeal to those who love Christian romances. - Sandra for myfictionnook.com
