9505037:::::Heku:::::Chevalier has never been told no. For thousands of years he s sat on the Equites Council, ruling body of his heku faction, and for thousands of years his every order has been followed immediately and without question. One of the most important rules of the heku, is that no one is to feed from unwilling donors. Following a tip that a young mortal woman is being brutally attacked by his own kind, he seeks her out and immediately begins to experience unnatural feelings for the woman. Emily, a beautiful rancher from Montana, has spent her entire life being violently attacked by beings she assumed were vampires. It isn t until she meets Chevalier that she learns of her startling family history, a history that immediately throws her into the volatile world of the heku. In a bid to protect her, Chevalier moves Emily into his isolated coven, which marks her as a prime target for the Valle and the Encala, enemy factions of the heku. Emily fights to fit into the militaristic world of the heku as her head-strong personality and independent ways turn their perfectly balanced world on end. She immediately befriends Kyle, a heku from Chevalier s coven, and together they find Emily a niche among the immortal. Emily s violent past interferes with Chevalier s plans, and he must first undo what her abusive ex-husband did before he can convince her how much he cares about her, and how much she s worth to his faction. Chevalier s growing feelings for Emily are unnatural to his kind, and must be hidden from the rest of the Equites Faction if he s to remain a formidable part of their Council. His jealous tendencies rage as Emily gets closer to Kyle, and both heku struggle to make her realize how important she is to the faction and how endangered she now is.
