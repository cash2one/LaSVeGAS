954936:::::The Marquesa:::::Isabel Leon went West seeking to end a man's life. Instead, she is beginning a new life of her own. Fortune. Fame. Romance. Heartache. Revenge. " The Marquesa" is familiar with the plot. It's just like the dramas Isabel Leon has starred in from San Francisco to New York. But never did she dream it would describe her own life. And never in Cantrell, Montana. Yet Cantrell offers Isabel true friends, a place to finally call home and the chance to become a new woman. She is no longer a daring actress always on the move, but the proprietor of her own, soon-to-be-completed hotel. Captain Dawson Mandara has guaranteed to finish construction on Isabel's hotel within six weeks--assuming they can learn to work together. He irritates and frustrates her, but she is intrigued by the past he won't talk about and the family that he will. Between robberies, shootouts, friends disappearing, folks being murdered, and finding her freedom while in jail, life in Montana is every bit as exciting as the dramas she once acted in. But if Isabel is offered the role she always dreamed of, will she be ready to accept it?
