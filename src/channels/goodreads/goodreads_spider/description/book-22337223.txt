22337223:::::The Hollow Man:::::A terrorist s plot, the assassination of a prime minister, holds the key to an apocalyptic plot to destroy Europe s economy. It s impossible to stop, but one man doesn t know enough to think the world can t be saved. He s no hero; not clever or capable, talented or tested. The Hollow Man is just trying to survive in an uncertain climate where terrorism is changing the rules of how we live. The Hollow Man is a field analyst assigned to learn the new tactics of terror while trying to keep disaster from U.S. borders. If he fails and lets that happen, he lets down a world of people who didn t even know he exists. Confronting his own demons along with soldiers of this new world, he is young, untrained and ill-prepared for what he finds. Based on true events, a young man running from Vietnam finds himself in another kind of war. A new war of terror is spreading across Europe. As a naive field analyst for a U.S. government agency, he is assigned to babysit the unpopular Prime Minister of Spain, Luis Carrero Blanco. It s easy duty for a young unskilled analyst. But the quick assassination of Blanco by the ruthless terrorist, Chaban, sets off a chase across Spain and France to stop him before he can complete his plan to destroy the economy of Europe. Haunted by one of Chaban s previous murder victims, a twelve year old girl, the analyst battles ruthless assassins and his own personal demons in a vicious struggle to save 5,000 innocent lives from becoming collateral damage in the terrorist s psychotic plot. Disowned by the American government, no one can help him except Zita, MI6 agent and lover. They follow the trail from Madrid to Paris always a step behind.
