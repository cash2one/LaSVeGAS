Injured FBI Special Agent Jon Stevens is back on the job, with a broken skull, a broken spirit and a ritualistic murder case only his talents can solve... And a vigilante begins targeting celebrities he deems worthy of his own savage brand of justice. What ties them all together? A revenge served so cold and so calculating that it uses everyone from opportunistic Russians, corrupt businessmen, an agoraphobic hacker--to a rock super star--to reach its goal. *The Rock Star* is the first thrilling book in the *Rock Series* trilogy.
