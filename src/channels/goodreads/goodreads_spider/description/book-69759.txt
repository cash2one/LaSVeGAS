69759:::::Bomarzo:::::Bomarzo, by Manuel Mujica L inez, is one of the most singular and passionate novels to come out of Latin America. Its publication had an extraordinary resonance, connected to the banning of the opera that inspired maestro Alberto Ginastera and was first performed in Washington with unanimous success. It was preceded by the prestigious National Literature Prize, the John F. Kennedy Prize, and the Gold Medal of the Italian Government. Eminent critics, both abroad and within, have noted its great merit. Jorge Luis Borges, during the dinner he hosted in honor of Mujica Laines soon after the release of Bomarzo, thanked him for the level of excellence to which he had taken the novel as a literary genre.
