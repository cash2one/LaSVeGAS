10368067:::::Poke the Box:::::We send our kids to school and obsess about their test scores, their behavior, and their ability to fit in. We post a help wanted ad and look for experience, famous colleges, and a history of avoiding failure. We invest in companies based on how they did last quarter, not on what they re going to do tomorrow. So why are we surprised when it all falls apart? Our economy is not static, but we act as if it is. Your position in the world is defined by what you instigate, how you provoke, and what you learn from the events you cause. In a world filled with change, that s what matters your ability to create and learn from change. Poke the Box is a manifesto about producing something that s scarce, and thus valuable. It demands that you stop waiting for a road map and start drawing one instead. You know how to do this, you ve done it before, but along the way, someone talked you out of it. We need your insight and your dreams and your contributions. Hurry.
