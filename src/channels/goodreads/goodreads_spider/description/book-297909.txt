Such an artist is able to transcend established thinking and help us redefine ourselves and our world. Today, a growing number of art critics, philosophers, and spiritual seekers believe that they have found that vision in the art of Alex Grey. Transfigurations , the follow-up to Grey s Sacred Mirrors (1991)--one of the most successful art books of the 1990s--includes all of Grey s major works completed in the following decade, including the masterful seven-paneled altarpiece Nature of Mind, called the grand climax of Grey s art by Donald Kuspit. His portrayals of human beings blend anatomical exactitude with visionary depictions of universal life energy. Alex Grey s striking artwork leads us on the soul s journey from material world encasement to recovery of the divinely illuminated core.
