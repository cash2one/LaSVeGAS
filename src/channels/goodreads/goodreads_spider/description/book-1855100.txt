1855100:::::Family Guy: Stewie's Guide To World Domination:::::For the first time ever a cancelled show has been resurrected on the basis of its cult following in syndication, on the internet and on DVD (Over 2.2 million DVDs sold to date ) and we've got the tie-in book authored by one of the show's hilarious lead writers and animators At first sight, the Griffens may seem like a normal blue collar family from Quonochontaug Rhode Island, but Peter (the family's loutish dad), Brian (the erudite, martini-swilling pet dog) and Stewie (the evil toddler son) set them apart from all others. Now Stewie--a true baby genius and the most popular of the Griffen clan--speaks out. Having been hell bent on achieving world domination ever since he escaped the cursed ovarian Bastille he was incarcerated in for nine grueling months, he has finally decided that in order to rule the world we live in one must first understand it. Herewith are his musings on family, love, parenting, preschool, work, pop culture, politics and more. If only we knew then what Stewie knows now, adults everywhere could have defeated their mother's matriarchal tyranny and toppled the "gynocracy" she ruled over . . .and god knows what else This book is for the insufferable child in us all, eager to buck the ways of the old guard or just eager for a laugh.
