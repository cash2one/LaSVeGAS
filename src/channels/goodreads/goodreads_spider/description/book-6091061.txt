6091061:::::Ester Ried:::::"If something would only happen--if I could have one day, just one day, different from the others!" Thus mourned Ester Ried, for it seemed to her that her days consisted of nothing but monotony. Every day she made beds, baked endless pies in a hot kitchen, ironed, and raced against the clock to get tea on the table for the boarders. Every evening she fell into bed, too weary even for prayers, much less any Bible reading. As she nursed her suffering soul, she snapped at her sisters and brother until her very crossness added still more to her suffering and made her crosser still! Then a letter arrived from a well-to-do cousin in New York City--and thing did begin to happen. Ester was invited for a visit, and when she accepted, she had no idea that the coming days would change her life in ways she had never imagined. Heartwarming stories of faith and love by Grace Livingston Hill's aunt--Isabella Alden. Each book is similar in style and tone to Hill's and is set in the late 1800s and early 1900s.
