13423169:::::Hostile Takeover:::::Book V of the Knights of the Board Room series (can be read as standalone) Ben is the last unattached member of the five-man executive team of K&amp;A Associates. The other four, all Masters, have found the submissive of their dreams. That s fine. The sharp-edged lawyer knows he s the most hardcore of all of them, with extreme tastes as a Master he satisfies physically through experienced club submissives. He doesn t really need anything more than that. Marcie has loved Ben since she was sixteen. He s never behaved as anything more than a protective big brother, a family friend. But now she s twenty three and starting her career as a corporate investigator. She may be a blood-and-bone deep submissive, but she won t hesitate to use her aggressive talents to prove she s meant to be his. With a Master as tough as Ben, she ll have to take whatever measures are needed even if her deepest desire isn t a hostile takeover of his heart, but an unconditional surrender to it. Reader Advisory: Marcie s sexual journey contains a group scene of female/female sexual exploration. The Masters also share her in a brief group scene.
