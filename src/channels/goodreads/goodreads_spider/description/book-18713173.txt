18713173:::::101 Dicas do Feng Shui para o seu Lar:::::Many books on feng shui are geared toward homeowners, but Webster applies feng shui principles to individual rooms as well as the whole house, which makes 101 Feng Shui Tips for the Home just as useful to apartment dwellers. While his list of tips makes for a quick reference when changing or adding to your decor, Webster includes plenty of information on the principles behind these tips to keep you from making an honest mistake, such as placing too many mirrors in your bedroom. An excellent source for beginners, Webster's descriptive room-by-room walk-through will have you cultivating energy and harmonizing your home's elements in no time. --Brian Patterson
