16003989:::::Sleepeth Not, the Bastard:::::"The gravity of fate is nothing in comparison to the fleeting warmth of a loved one's last kiss..." ....thus reads the final words of High School Senior Joshua Feranna. Several years later, Lew, his father, currently working for a faceless loan shark, has dipped into a drug and lust-filled method of cope. Separated but not divorced, his wife Autumn finally tracks Lew down, begging him to come home to help take care of their identity-in-crisis daughter Zoey. But when Lew's friend from high school, Sarah Fox, having lived the life of a drummer in the all-but extinct rock band "The Bastards" returns to town stalked by a rumored "Resurrection Tour", Lew's world truly becomes a thing of legend....and doubt. What transpires from then on is a continuing snowball effect that will inevitably lead to the cataclysmic destruction of one family and others as the world continues to busy itself around them in seamless melancholy. "Sleepeth Not, the Bastard" is a story about people, each one steadily climbing towards a foreseeable yet undeniable end. Each person influencing the other in one massive string of events escalating and culminating at the end of their respective worlds whether those worlds be of mental, emotional, psychological, or delusional origin. Part drama, part dark comedy, part rock 'n roll epic, with a copious and perhaps endless helping of sex, drugs, and infamy... "Sleepeth Not, the Bastard" is a romp for this generation, an homage to those that came before, and a warning for those that follow.
