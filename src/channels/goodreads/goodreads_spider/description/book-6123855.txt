6123855:::::Lunatic Soup: A True Story of Murder, Mayhem and Madness in Maximum Security:::::Andrew Fraser s bestselling and controversial true crime memoirs are now being adapted into an exciting new television series titled Killing Time. After being convicted and disbarred, Fraser became the confidant of one of Australia s most notorious serial killers, Peter Dupas. What he learned made him the Homicide Squad s secret weapon. Angry at his treatment in jail and his excessive sentence, the long time defence lawyer enjoyed the irony of his situation: the authorities who destroyed his career now needed his cooperation. There was never any doubt that Andrew would give evidence, even though he knew that the defence would try to destroy his credibility by bringing up the past he desperately wanted to forget. Fraser paints a vivid picture of the grim, terrifying, and futile reality of maximum security prison life and of his time spent with the murderers, psychopaths, and paedophiles. Lunatic Soup relates his harrowing experiences of the justice system as a prisoner and on the stand as a witness in a murder trial.
