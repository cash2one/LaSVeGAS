29379532:::::Gathering Ashes:::::Four years have passed since Bobbi January learned about the existence of the Yathi race and its plans for humanity. Since then, she s become more than a career data thief or anticorporate provacateur - she s the leader of a force of humans and reformed Yathi hosts dedicated to fighting the aliens wherever they can be found. Hers is a war fought in the dark, and like all wars, it has been costly. Friends have died, others have soured, and the rebellion that started out so strongly has broken into two embittered camps. When Bobbi is nearly killed by a surpise strike after a successful mission, it looks as though the Yathi may be the least of her problems. Meanwhile, Thomas Walken, held prisoner by the Yathi since his capture six years previous, awakens. Escaping from an alien installation, he must grapple with a body - and perhaps a mind - that is not his own, and try to reclaim the humanity which the Yathi s have so vigorously tried to scrub from his mind. Hunted by the Mother of Systems, he aims to reconnect with Bobbi, but will she accept him as a man, or denounce him as a creation of the enemy? Packed with action, intrigue, and dark futuristic thrills, Gathering Ashes transports you to the very edge of a dangerously uncertain future.
