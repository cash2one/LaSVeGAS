9808117:::::Shattered Sky:::::Surviving a missile strike on her aircraft suddenly seems like the easy part for Lauren Bennett. A year after being attacked mid flight, Lauren is sure she s overcome her guilt at losing a friend in the ensuing crash. Her brittle, glossy veneer doesn t fool Callam Granger, though. But the naval patrol boat captain knows he s got no right to an opinion. He wasn t there when she needed him most and she s not going to let him forget it. On a routine surveillance assignment Lauren uncovers an operation trafficking sex slaves. Pursuing the women and their captors will take her deep into the Australian outback and a reluctant Callam knows this time he can t let her go alone. Is it possible for Lauren and Callam to put aside old enmities to outwit, outrun and ultimately out-fly the traffickers? Or will the frantic race to free the women simply ignite their emotions, endangering yet more lives?
