54016:::::Todos los fuegos el fuego:::::Todos los fuegos el fuego offers eight great examples of the creative fullness that encompasses Cortazar's stories. From the exasperated metaphor of human relationships that is "La autopista del sur" through the masterpiece that is "El otro cielo," Cortazar once again paves the way to stories that are a must-read for lovers of the story genre in general. "La salud de los enfermos," "Reunisn," "La seqorita Cora," "La isla a mediodma," "Instrucciones para John Howell," and "Todos los fuegos el fuego" are a celebration of intelligence, passion, and genius.
