6053576:::::El caballero de Alcantara:::::Luis Maria Monroy is a young nobleman who returns to Spain after being released from a long captivity in Istanbul. At home he finds a reality very different from the one he left when he went to war a decade ago. His brother Maximino, the owner of the family manor, a man of character, is hard not to just accept the presence of the newcomer. Problems happen and Luis Maria must leave again, following the fate of many younger sons of noble families, to become a knight of a military order by entering the holy convent of Alcantara.
