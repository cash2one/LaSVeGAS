37693:::::New Moon:::::It's in one man's true nature to remain by the side of the woman he loves, rather than live without her in his own universe... Landscape architect Logan Marshall is out for a jog -- in his werewolf form -- when a trap catches his paw. As it saps his strength, he is saved by another werewolf, who -- to Logan's amazement -- is female. Female werewolves aren't supposed to exist. But Rinna is a shapeshifter from another dimension who's traveled through a portal to this world. And the trap that ensnared Logan was set by her former captor, and meant for her.... But as soon as Rinna and Logan touch, an electrifying bond forms between them. Unable to resist his desire for Rinna, in all her many forms, Logan will have to earn her trust, and travel through both dimensions to save her -- and earth -- from the wrath of her enemy....
