1156197:::::The Lifeguard:::::A summer of sun, sand and murder. Kelsey's summer should have been paradise: An invitation to rich and famous Beverly Island, complete with sun-drenched beaches and three gorgeous lifeguards on duty. But Kelsey's summer is the opposite of paradise. It starts with the note under her pillow from a girl who's missing. Then there's the crazy man in the lighthouse who won't leave Kelsey alone. And there have been a number of suspicious drownings.... At least she has the lifeguards around to protect her.... Poor Kelsey. Someone forgot to tell her that lifeguards don't always like to save lives.
