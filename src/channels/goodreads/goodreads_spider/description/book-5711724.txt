5711724:::::Intensely Alice:::::Wouldn t it be great to go back to the time before Pam got pregnant, before Patrick left for the University of Chicago, before anyone was making any big decisions about sex or college or life in general? Wouldn t it be great to get the whole gang together again, just once? What it takes for this to happen will change Alice (and the whole gang) forever. A funeral is not a happy reunion. Full of life the good, the bad, and the heartbreaking the latest Alice book reminds us just how much can change in an instant.
