22025184:::::Semper Mine:::::A freak accident landed both of the Khavalov twins under my command, just before a routine mission turned into a nightmare. I brought home one twin in a coffin and the other in a coma missing his leg. I did everything right and still people died. I can t forget that night or how many lives it changed, including mine. It s natural for their sister, Katya, to blame me. I made one decision in the middle of a firefight, and it shattered her sheltered world. I m the ice to her fire, and when we first meet, it s not pretty. I don t fear war or death, and I am definitely not going to let a beautiful woman with a quick temper and broken heart scare me off, either. I know she s hurting, and I m determined to make sure she s okay. It s the least I can do for the twins. I may have failed them that night, but I won t fail her. What I m not counting on: the feelings she ignites within me. Captain Sawyer Mathis A standalone novel in the Sons of War contemporary military romance series.
