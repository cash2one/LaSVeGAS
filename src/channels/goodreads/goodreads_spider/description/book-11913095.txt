11913095:::::Learning How to Eat:::::THIS EASY PLAN REALLY WORKS! "Learning how to eat (again)" is designed to reveal how the careful monitoring of daily fat intake (DFI) can allow a person to EASILY control their weight. Deceptive food industry practices have made it necessary to learn how to determine fat content of food products without depending on the product disclosures. With practice, anyone can learn to regulate their DFI and thus, lose as much weight as they desire and KEEP IT OFF!
