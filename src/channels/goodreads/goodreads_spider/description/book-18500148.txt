Eugene Eris, the name inscribed on the two tombstones, haunts Sam at every turn. The beautiful geneticist Blair Tennyson helps Sam understand the how and why of genetic manipulation and the dark history of America's attempt to genetically improve the human species. Sam trusts no one except small-town waitress Annie George. But, like Sam, Annie is linked to Eris. Together they race to unearth the graves of a lost cemetery and to expose the mass murders of people who were involved in an experiment much larger and more sinister than Sam envisioned. Steven W.

The tension mounts as Sam navigates toward the shocking conclusion
