18001649:::::Georgetown Academy: Season One:::::Available for the first time in a single volume, the first four books of the Georgetown Academy series have been hailed by Gossip Girl producer, Josh Schwartz, as Smart, sexy and insanely addictive. Now it s your turn to get hooked. Meet Ellie, Brinley, Evan, and Taryn Four sophomores at Georgetown Academy, D.C. s most exclusive private school, where among the exclusive parties and perfectly manicured lawns, student life seems drama-free. But everyone always has something to hide. THE IT GIRL NEXT DOOR Everyone wants a piece of Ellie Walker and her Senator mom, but Ellie s always been happy to cede the spotlight. Kind-hearted, sweet, and half of G.A. s perfect power couple, Ellie has it all until her ex-boyfriend, Gabe, moves back to town and turns her world upside down leaving her to choose between love and loyalty. THE DC PRINCESS Brinley Madison, of those Madisons, relishes her family s status as the ultimate D.C. insiders. While her political strategist father plays kingmaker, Brinley maneuvers behind the scenes in school and at home. Brinley knows better than to keep a secret that could hurt her family, but sometimes desire turns to addiction, putting the family reputation at risk. THE OUTSIDER Evan Hartnett doesn t have the typical pedigree of a G.A., student. In fact, she has no pedigree at all. Her academic scholarship may get her access to the classroom, but she s still on the outside looking in until a series of unexpected boyfriends rocket her to national attention. THE CALIFORNIA GIRL Taryn Reyes laid-back, bohemian vibe doesn t exactly mesh with her new surroundings, but she s remarkably secure and unconcerned. But after her first run-in with D.C. s dirty politics, she finds out that keeping her integrity and her heart intact may be harder than she thinks.
