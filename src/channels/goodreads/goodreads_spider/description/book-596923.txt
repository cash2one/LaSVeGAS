596923:::::A Tale of the Western Plains:::::In this story, Henty crafts a rousing adventure drawing on real life cowboy stories. "In treating cowboy life", he tells us, "indeed, it may well be said that truth is stranger than fiction". Henty accurately describes the life of the true American frontiersmen -- mining, hunting, lumberjacking, cattle ranching, trapping, fighting hostile Indian tribes, transporting the reader back to the early days of the Wild West with enough mystery thrown in to capture the reader's imagination.
