11238:::::The Philosopher's Pupil:::::When George McCaffrey s car plunges into a canal with his wife still inside, nobody knows whether George is to blame. Nobody, that is, except an Anglican priest who happened to witness the whole thing. And when George s former teacher, the charismatic philosopher Rozanov, returns to town, George s life begins to spin wildly out of control. Set in the English spa town of Ennistone, The Philosopher s Pupil is a darkly comic story of love, redemption, and the complex nature of the human condition.
