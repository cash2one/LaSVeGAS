16001302:::::Miriam's Letter:::::In Amish Circle Letters, follow the journey of a series of letters that pass through the Fisher family. As Amish do not use computers or cell phones to communicate, Amish women will often write circle letters, letters that they send to a list of addresses of people that they would like to include in the correspondence. Since they do not have access to photocopiers, the first person on the list will receive the letter, read it, and respond. That person sends both the first letter and their response to the second name on the list. This continues until the entire package of letters goes full-circle, returning to the original sender. In Volume 1 of the 10 part series, Miriam's Letter, Miriam Fisher decides to start a circle letter among her children that no longer live at home. While writing the letter, someone vandalizes Steve's farm, frightening the children as well as the adults. Yet, this one action starts a chain reaction of events that could alter the lives of several members of the family. Meet Miriam's bachelor son, Steve, daughter, Mary Ruth, and grand-daughter, Katie as the letters weave together a tale that can only be viewed through the eyes of the reader.
