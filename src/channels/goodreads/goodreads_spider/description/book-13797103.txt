13797103:::::Birth of the Nyxian:::::Harlow Garrington is a twenty-six year old woman left alone in the world when her family perished in a tragic accident. She led a quiet life and lived in her books until a chance meeting brought Aiden into her life. He was smart, sexy, and chivalrous- everything she wanted in a man. There was just one problem; he was also an eight hundred year old vampire. Nearly a thousand years ago, vampires split into two factions. Those who chose to sacrifice their souls for immortality were pure evil, without a shred of humanity left. They existed to kill and terrify. Those turned by force, like Aiden, were able to retain some of their humanity and did not need to kill to survive. Harlow found everything she ever wanted from life with Aiden, but his love was not without a price. Aiden has long been coveted by Hades because he stood out from other vampires. When their love is discovered, Harlow's life is in jeopardy. Aiden convinces her to flee with him, hoping to keep her safe until he can come up with a plan. Will Harlow get to live a lifetime with Aiden, or will she be forced to make The Immortal Choice? Their journey takes them across the world, encountering all kinds of magic and monsters and even a few Greek gods, coming to a stunning conclusion that may change the fate of humanity. Full of action, history, drama, and intrigue, Birth of the Nyxian is a steamy paranormal romance with so much more than romance!
