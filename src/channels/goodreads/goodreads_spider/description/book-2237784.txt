2237784:::::Faces of Fear:::::Fifteen-year old Allison Shaw may not be beautiful, but she doesn't really care. She is happier hanging with her friends and playing sports than admiring herself in a mirror. But when her mother, Risa, marries the premier plastic surgeon Conrad Dunn, he moves them from Santa Monica to his enormous home in exclusive Bel Air. Everywhere Allison and her mother look beautiful people have benefited from Conrad's skillful knife. With her new friends' encouragement, Allison and her mother reluctantly agree to her sweet sixteen-gift from Conrad: breast implants. Risa begins to realize Conrad's obsession with his deceased wife. She discovers not only his fixation with the beautiful dead Margot, but other dark, murky secrets begin to surface, as well, pointing to a more sinister agenda. What else does he have in mind for her daughter? Is it too late to save Allison from the scalpel of her ever so charming husband?
