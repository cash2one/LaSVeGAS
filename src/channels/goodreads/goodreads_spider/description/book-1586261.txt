1586261:::::The Play of the Eyes:::::This is the third volume of Elias Canetti's autobiography, following "The Tongue Set Free" and "The Torch in My Ear". It is set in Vienna between 1931 and 1937, at a time when the European catastrophe was already clear to anyone with eyes to see. The book is both a portrait of its time and an intellectual and spiritual autobiography. Canetti describes his relationships with Herman Broch, Robert Musil, Fritz Wortruba, the composer Alban Berg, and Alma Mahler.
