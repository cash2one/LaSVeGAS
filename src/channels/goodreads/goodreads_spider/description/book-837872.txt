837872:::::Day by Day Kid's Bible: The Bible for Young Readers:::::Popular children's author Karyn Henley, author of The Beginner's Bible, has created a unique tool to help children establish Bible-reading habits for a lifetime with an investment of just seven minutes per day. In this revised version of God's Story, daily Bible readings lead readers ages seven and up through the Scriptures in just one year. The Day by Day Kid's Bible bridges the gap between a Bible storybook and a full-text Bible since the Scriptures are simplified for young readers. New features include dated Bible readings for every day of the year, two-color interior, and full-color pictorial time line of events.
