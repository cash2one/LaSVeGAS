When nineteen-year-old John Shaw returns from the trenches of World War I, he is haunted by nightmares not only of the battlefield, but of the strange, cruel and impossible feats of his regiment's commander, Quincey Harker. Harker's ferocity knows no limits, and his strength is superhuman. At first John blames his bloody nightmares on trench fever. But when Harker appears in England and begins wooing John's sister, John must confront the truth and stop Harker from continuing Dracula's bloodline.
