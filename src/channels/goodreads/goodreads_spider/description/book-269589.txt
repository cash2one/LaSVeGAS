William Carlos Williams said, "[Pound] discloses history by its odor, by the feel of it in the words; fuses it with the words, present and past, to MAKE his Cantos . Make them." Since the 1969 revised edition, the Italian Cantos LXXII and LXXIII (as well as a 1966 fragment concluding the work) have been added. Now appearing for the first time is Pound's recently found English translation of Italian Canto LXXII.
