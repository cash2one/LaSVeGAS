However, Ichigo's companion, the pyrotechnics-wielding Ganju, is having a much harder time with his Soul Reaper opponent. Meanwhile, Orihime and Ury confront the younger brother of the gargantuan gatekeeper whom Ichigo defeated a little while ago. It's time for Ury to put all his training to the test and prove to everyone (and himself) how much more powerful he has become.
