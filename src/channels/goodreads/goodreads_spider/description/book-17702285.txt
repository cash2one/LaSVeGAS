17702285:::::Ender's Game:::::The International Bestseller THE HUGO AND NEBULA AWARD WINNING NOVEL Orson Scott Card's beloved classic Ender's Game is now a major motion picture. Andrew "Ender" Wiggin thinks he is playing computer simulated war games; he is, in fact, engaged in something far more desperate. Ender may be the military genius Earth desperately needs in a war against an alien enemy seeking to destroy all human life. The only way to find out is to throw Ender into ever harsher training, to chip away and find the diamond inside, or destroy him utterly. Ender Wiggin is six years old when it begins. He will grow up fast. "Orson Scott Card makes a strong case for being the best writer science fiction has to offer." The Houston Post This movie tie-in edition features cover art from the Summit Entertainment film starring Harrison Ford, Ben Kingsley, and Asa Butterfield as Ender Wiggin.
