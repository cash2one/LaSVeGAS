17255662:::::The Triskele:::::The druids did not simply vanish, but they did hide themselves away and took the secret of the Bwy Hir with them. Deep in the Mountains of Snowdonia, North Wales, Anwen Morgan of Ty Mawr Farm knows that her secret meetings with Taliesin of the Bwy Hir are wrong, but they have fallen in love. Although they are worlds apart, their naivety does not allow them to grasp the consequences of their actions. Their indiscretions will shake the foundations of an ancient triskele formed to protect the lands of Cymru, to keep the old ways alive and serve the Bwy Hir, the ancient deities who claim the verdant mountains and valleys as their own. The Triskele is formed of three parts: Bwy Hir, Druids and Chosen. Their existence in mountains of Eryri is deep buried, secret and far reaching. Once proud and venerated, there are now dark and dangerous undercurrents flowing through the ranks of the triskele, murder and misdeeds are soon uncovered as the Morgans are targeted and their family torn apart.
