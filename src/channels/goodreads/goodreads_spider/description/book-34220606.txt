Born into a political dynasty, Jenna and Barbara Bush grew up in the public eye.

They spent their college years being trailed by the Secret Service and chased by the paparazzi, with every teenage mistake making national headlines.

In this book they take readers on a revealing, thoughtful, and deeply personal tour behind the scenes of their lives, with never-before-told stories about their family, their adventures, their loves and losses, and the special sisterly bond that fulfills them.
