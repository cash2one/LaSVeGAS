22774596:::::False Christ: Will the Antichrist Claim to Be the Jewish Messiah?:::::The thesis of this book is that the Antichrist will attempt to present himself as the Jewish Messiah, that he will try his best to appear as if he is instituting what Jewish believers know as the Messianic Age and what Christians know as the Millennial reign. This book will show that much of what we know about the Antichrist points to the conclusion that his goal is to deceive the world into believing that the Messiah has come, that the Messiah is, in fact, God, and that he deserves the worship of the world. His destruction of the enemies of Israel in Daniel 11:40-45, his seven-year covenant, his rebuilding of the temple and starting the daily sacrifice, his eventual ending of the sacrifices and sitting in the temple to accept worship, his making Jerusalem the capital of the world, even his promotion by the False Prophet (who, this book argues, will claim to be Elijah) all support this position. This view will be presented in great detail and special attention is also given to objections to it. This book also argues that the little-known eschatological (end-time) beliefs of the Jewish theologians, according to the Talmud and other rabbinic writings, seem to encourage Jews to accept as Messiah a man with the exact characteristics of the Antichrist. Correlating to this view, we will present evidence that Islamic beliefs about the end times, as related in the Quran and the hadiths (the sayings of Muhammad), will cause them to play a very important role in the Antichrist's rise to power. this view is the earliest view of the church, it has been almost totally forgotten in recent years. If it is true, it would mean the deception of Satan in the end times will be far more potent that many of us have ever imagined.
