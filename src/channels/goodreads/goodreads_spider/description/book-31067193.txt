31067193:::::STONED:::::A rock star with no rhythm is a man with no soul. Stone Lockhart As the lead singer of one of the hottest bands to hit the rock scene, f*cks are free, drugs come easy, and music is life. For as long as Stone can remember, Willow has been his music the notes that weave his soul together. His rhythm. Until he threw her away. All he has left is a handful of pills and a few lines of powder to make him forget her. And he tries, over and over. Clean and ready to make things right, he s faced with the fact that Willow s moved on. She s not the same girl he cast aside. Willow s a woman sure about her purpose in life. Sure about who she s meant to love. Stone may be lost without his rhythm, but Willow has found so much more.
