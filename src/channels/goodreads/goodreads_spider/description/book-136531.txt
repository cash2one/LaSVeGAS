136531:::::The Laramie Project:::::For a year and a half following the murder of Matthew Shepard, Mois s Kaufman and his Tectonic Theater Project whose previous play, Gross Indecency , was hailed as a work of unsurpassed originality conducted hundreds of interviews with the citizens of Laramie, Wyoming, to create this portrait of a town struggling with a horrific event. The savage killing of Shepard, a young gay man, has become a national symbol of the struggle against intolerance. But for the people of Laramie both the friends of Matthew and those who hated him without knowing him the tragedy was personal. In a chorus of voices that brings to mind Thornton Wilder s Our Town, The Laramie Project allows those most deeply affected to speak, and the result is a brilliantly moving theatrical creation.
