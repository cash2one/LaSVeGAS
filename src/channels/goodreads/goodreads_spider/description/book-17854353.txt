17854353:::::Inspirations from Heaven's Gate:::::I feel that I have been inspired to write this book with the help of the whispered power of the Holy Spirit. I want to help the broken and lost souls of humanity find their way and help them become stronger in their life. I feel the easiest way for me to do this is through the written word because words have power that can change a person for the better. This is a book of poetry with bible verses sprinkled throughout. May God bless your life through the reading of this book.
