980934:::::Return to the Island:::::Is Mary home for good? It is the spring of 1818 and Mary O'Shea has returned from England to her beloved Mackinac Island. She loves her life on the family firm and knows that she chose wisely in declining a marriage proposal from James Lindsay, a young duke she met during her travels. She is also delighted to once again spend time with White Hawk, her dearest friend. And although he is often called away to defend Indian claims to native lands, Mary cherishes White Hawk's visits, and hopes that one day he will stay forever. Then suddenly Mary's future comes into question when James appears at her doorstep to ask for her hand -- and refuses to leave until she consents. Now it seems that the only way for Mary to discover what her future holds is to uncover the truth of her own heart.
