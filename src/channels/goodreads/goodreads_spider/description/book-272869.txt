272869:::::Far as the Curse Is Found: The Covenant Story of Redemption:::::The Christian religion is not an otherworldly, eternal doctrine about the nature of deity or a polite philosophical discussion about the relation of spirit to matter. Instead, it is the historical unfolding of God s covenantal involvement in this world, the culmination of which is God s coming into this world in the person of Jesus Christ. Far as the Curse if Found is a retelling of the biblical story of God s unfolding covenant from creation to new creation. Readers are led to wonder anew at the redemptive work of God in our own history, in our own human flesh. Pastors, students, and those interested in biblical theology are among the many that will gain fresh insight into the biblical story of redemption.
