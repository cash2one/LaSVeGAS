6366371:::::You Are Here: Discovering the Magic of the Present Moment:::::In this book Thich Nhat Hanh, the renowned Zen monk, author, and meditation master, distills the essence of Buddhist thought and practice, emphasizing the power of mindfulness to transform our lives. Mindfulness is not an evasion or an escape, he explains. It means being here, present, and totally alive. It is true freedom and without this freedom, there is no happiness. Based on a retreat that Thich Nhat Hanh led for Westerners, this book offers a range of simple, effective practices for cultivating mindfulness, including awareness of breathing and walking, deep listening, and skillful speech. You Are Here also offers guidance on healing emotional pain and manifesting real love and compassion in our relationships with others. Simple, warm, direct, and startlingly potent, this book reveals the heart of the Buddhist path and helps us to reconnect with the joy and wonder of being alive, regardless of life s changing circumstances. Praise for Thich Nhat Hanh Among Buddhist leaders influential in the West, Thich Nhat Hanh ranks second only to the Dalai Lama. New York Times Thich Nhat Hanh writes with the voice of the Buddha.
