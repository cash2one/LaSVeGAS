67977:::::The Sane Society:::::Social psychologist Erich Fromm s seminal exploration of the profound ills of modern society, and how best to overcome them One of Fromm s main interests was to analyze social systems and their impact on the mental health of the individual. In this study, he reaches further and asks: Can a society be sick? He finds that it can, arguing that Western culture is immersed in a pathology of normalcy that affects the mental health of individuals. In The Sane Society , Fromm examines the alienating effects of modern capitalism, and discusses historical and contemporary alternatives, particularly communitarian systems. Finally, he presents new ideas for a re-organization of economics, politics, and culture that would support the individual s mental health and our profound human needs for love and freedom.
