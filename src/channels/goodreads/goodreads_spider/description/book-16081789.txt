16081789:::::La Vita Sexy:::::After I found my husband boffing the church secretary, I got on a plane with a mission to get away from it all and figure out my life. Instead, I fell into the arms of sexy Italian wine-seller Luca, who rocked my world, and now I'm all kinds of confused. I can't get enough of him, but the intensity of our connection scares me. The incredible things he does to my body scares me, if only because I like them so very much. So what's the problem? I'm supposed to be on a trip around the world, on a journey of self-discovery, but I haven't even gotten past Italy, past Luca. My heart and mind are saying one thing, but my body is saying something much different. One thing is for sure. I will never be the same.
