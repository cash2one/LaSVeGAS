1956954:::::Don't Hex with Texas:::::Everything s bigger in Texas including romance, magic, and danger! Katie Chandler has fled fast-paced Manhattan and returned home to a simpler life, working at her family s feed-and-seed store in Cobb, Texas. In a painfully selfless gesture, Katie had left the sexy wizard Owen Palmer to battle his demons in the magical realm after all, Katie just seemed to attract evil, which only made Owen s job a lot harder. But now it seems that trouble has followed her home: Despite the fact that Merlin, Katie s old boss at Magic, Spells, and Illusions, Inc., has assured her that Cobb is free of enchantmen, (magically speaking), Katie begins to notice curious phenomena. Cobb is being plagued by a series of inexplicable petty crimes and other devilish mischief, and after her experiences in Manhattan, Katie knows unauthorized magic when she sees it. As this new darkness strikes deep in the heart of Texas, Owen appears (literally) to investigate. Now Katie s friends and family must show the bad guys why it s bad luck to hex with Texas, while Katie and Owen combine their strengths like never before to uncover a sinister plot before evil takes root in the Lone Star State. Enchanting . . . Trying to start a romance with the world hanging in the balance is not optimal, but it sure is funny. Romantic Times , on Shanna Swendson s Damsel Under Stress Winning . . .
