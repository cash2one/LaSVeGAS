66428:::::Bridge My Way:::::If you have never been in love, don't read this book! If you have never thought of yourself as a little bit crazy, don't read this book! But if you believe in fairy tales and fantasy, romance and obsession, read on -- this book is for you. Zia says, "This book is for all those people who ever started doing something and became so involved that they lost all track of time, because the 'thing' that I started doing was playing bridge and the time that flew so painlessly by was my life.". Bridge My Way is the irresistible story of the world's most flamboyant bridge player -- Zia -- how he rose in a few short years from an unknown rubber bridge player to the world's most charismatic bridge star.
