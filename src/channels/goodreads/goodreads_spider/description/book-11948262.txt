11948262:::::Fall: The Last Testament of Lucifer Morningstar:::::An Amazon Top Twenty Hot New Release For fans of Neil Gaiman and Steven Brust And so it came to pass in the waning days of our century that a curious deal was struck between Heaven and Hell, or more specifically between Lucifer Morning Star and the Presence. The Book of Life, that book that holds the names of those souls deemed for salvation has been stolen from the Silver City. Without the Book there can be no Judgement as foretold in the Revelation. Two renegade angels are suspect and are believed to be on Earth. For reasons known only to himself, Lucifer accepts the deal with Heaven to recover the Book of Life. But jealousy and pride are not an exclusive domain. A small band of angels lead by Mika il, the Angel of Vengeance seeks to stop him. Accompanying the Morning Star on the most important quest in Creation are Maggie McCreedy, a recently widowed romance writer now witness to Lucifer s Testament; Duma, a misfit angel who almost joined in the Fall; Andrew Honeybone, a not quite yet dead, but rotting lawyer, and Mr. Pouge, an enigmatic gorilla of a man. Together their journey takes them from the Silver City of Heaven to the Ninth Circle of Hell to the now desert wasteland of an earthly Eden. It is a mythical mystery tale of redemption, deceit, salvation, betrayal and faith. Part I of The Fallen Trilogy.
