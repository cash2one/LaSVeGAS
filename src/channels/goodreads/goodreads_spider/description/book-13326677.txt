13326677:::::OCD Love Story:::::When Bea meets Beck, she knows instantly that he s her kind of crazy. Sweet, strong, kinda-messed-up Beck understands her like no one else can. He makes her feel almost normal. He makes her feel like she could fall in love again. But despite her feelings for Beck, Bea can t stop thinking about someone else: a guy who is gorgeous and magnetic... and has no idea Bea even exists. But Bea knows a lot about him. She spends a lot of time watching him. She has a journal full of notes. Some might even say she s obsessed. Bea tells herself she s got it all under control. But this isn t a choice, it s a compulsion. The truth is, she s breaking down...and she might end up breaking her own heart.
