75586:::::The Tain: From the Irish epic Tain Bo Cuailnge:::::The T in B C ailnge , centre-piece of the eighth-century Ulster cycle of heroic tales, is Ireland's nearest approach to a great epic. It tells the story of a great cattle-raid, the invasion of Ulster by the armies of Medb and Ailill, queen and king of Connacht, and their allies, seeking to carry off the great Brown Bull of C ailnge. The hero of the tale is C chulainn, the Hound of Ulster, who resists the invaders single-handed, while Ulster's warriors lie sick. Thomas Kinsella's presents a complete and living version of the story. His translation is based on the partial texts in two medieval manuscripts, with elements from other version, and adds a group of related stories which prepare for the action of the T in . Illustrated with brush drawings by Louis le Brocquy, this edition provides a combination of medieval epic and modern art.
