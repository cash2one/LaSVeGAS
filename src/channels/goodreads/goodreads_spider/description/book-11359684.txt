11359684:::::Seeing Cinderella:::::Calliope Meadow Anderson wishes her life could be more of a fairy tale just like the stories she writes. Her best friend, Ellen, is acting weird, her parent's marriage is falling apart, and to top things off, she found out she needs hideously large and geeky glasses. But Callie soon learns they aren't just any glasses they are magical and let her read people's thoughts. For the first time ever she's answering all the questions right in math class, and gets a glimpse of what goes through people's minds all day, including what Ellen and her longtime crush really think of her. As if dealing with these crazy glasses weren't enough, Callie tries out for the lead in her school's production of Cinderella and actually gets the part. Instead, Callie chooses to let Ellen have the lead and be Ellen's understudy just like she has done for their entire friendship. Add in a new girl who has something to hide, a secret admirer, a best friend stealer who isn't what she seems, and Callie's year just went from ordinary to extraordinary. Can this supporting actress learn to be a leading lady in her own life? Or is she destined to stay in the background forever even with her super-freaky-magic glasses?
