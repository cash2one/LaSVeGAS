226151:::::Reckoning:::::Mary Seward thought she had escaped the darkness of Transylvania and the evil that claimed the soul of her fiance, John Shaw. But now, back in England, Mary has terrible nightmares, fears the dark, sees vampires everywhere she turns. And when a strange virus weakens her father and her patients at the clinic, she suspects that there' s a far more sinister explanation than the one the doctors provide. Then Quincey Harker, heir to Count Dracula' s bloodline, shows himself in England. Gaunt and pale, he claims to have renounced his evil heritage, in part out of love for Mary. But is he telling the truth - or playing a deadly game with her? Kate Cary continues her follow-up to Bram Stoker' s original Dracula, examining the nature of good and evil, and the places where both exist at once.
