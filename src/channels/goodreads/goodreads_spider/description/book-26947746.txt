26947746:::::Spanish Islam: A Concise History:::::There are many books of history that fill you with garbage, let this one be the opposite and fill your heart with light and a clearer understanding of the misconceptions in relation to Al-Andalus that is one of the most extraordinary portions of our great Islamic history and is the greatest European expression of Islam. Many of the traits on which modern Europe prides itself came to it from Muslim Spain. Diplomacy, free trade, open borders, the techniques of academic research, of anthropology, etiquette, fashion, various types of medicine and hospitals, all came from the great city of cities; Cordoba. The age that paved the way for the European renaissance was known as the Islamic Golden Age and a renaissance took place under the influence of the Arabs and Moorish revival of culture. Re-visiting the Islamic Golden Age is crucial to understanding the nature of a renaissance. Muslims were created to be leaders and to lead humanity to what is good and forbid what is evil.
