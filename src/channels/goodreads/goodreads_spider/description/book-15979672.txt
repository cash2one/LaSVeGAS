She spends her days studying written texts in the government s Office of Readers, and she spends her nights taking care of her sick sister. She always always follows the rules. Despite her low profile, she has mysteriously become a target. Someone has kidnapped her sister. Someone else is trying to kill her. And someone has sent a Soul-Breather to beguile her out of her secrets. Her help comes from the mythic leader of an underground rebel movement. A man who used to be her friend. A man who has silently loved her for years. He disappeared from her life without a word, and now he expects her to trust him again. Then there s the Soul-Breather, a man who can taste her spirit with only a touch. He makes her feel things she s never experienced before, but she doesn t know if the feelings are real. Hired to deceive and betray her, he offers to help her instead. Without both men, she can t rescue her sister. And she can t discover the world-changing knowledge buried in her memory that has made her a target in the first place.
