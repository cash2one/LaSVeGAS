1825349:::::Home-Making:::::Don't let the title fool you. This is not just a book for women who keep home. Home-Making is an uncompromising vision statement for the domestic bliss and cultural dominion of the Christian family. The message of Home-Making is powerful: "Sisters, Brothers, Husbands, Wives -- Home life is meant to be beautiful, ennobling, and victorious!" God intends for each person, from parent to child, to play a role in family life, the ultimate goal of which is the transformation of the individual, the home and the society for the glory of God. Miller writes things that we know are true and that we need to hear, but everyone is afraid to say. He carefully addresses each member of the family and somehow manages to find the perfect balance between inspiration and exhortation.
