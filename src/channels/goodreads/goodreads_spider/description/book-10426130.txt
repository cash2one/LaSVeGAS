10426130:::::Bitterroot Crossing:::::A love triangle that crosses centuries . . . For Nick Crush, the only thing cool about his town, Bitterroot Crossing, is the gang of outlaw ghosts that rise occasionally from the town's swamp. But when he finds himself competing with the most notorious spirit and his own ancestor, Zedekiah Crush, for the affections of Jessie Sterling, suddenly the whole ghost thing isn't so cool. Jessie Sterling inherited her great-great-grandma's shorter left leg and incredible beauty, a beauty that a century and a half earlier sparked a love triangle that ended in tragedy. Now Jessie leaves the safety of her grandma's farm to attend high school in town . . . and Bitterroot Crossing will never be the same.
