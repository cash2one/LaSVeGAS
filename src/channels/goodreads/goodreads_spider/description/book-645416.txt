645416:::::Malgudi Schooldays: The Adventures Of Swami And His Friends:::::This is a slightly abridged version of Narayan's celebrated novel 'Swami and Friends', and includes two other short stories featuring Swami. It is a brilliantly evocative and delightfully funny account of the growing-up years from one of the greatest English language writers of our time.
