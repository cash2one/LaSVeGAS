25994864:::::Twisted Bitch:::::London Lie, cheat, steal Dante will do anything to get his way. I drew a line. I stay on one side and Dante stays on the other, plain and simple. Blurry, blotchy, and broken in most places, this line I ve drawn, the one that says absolutely no f*****g Dante beyond this point, is useless. We ll have to be around each other, and there s no way to change that yet. He s stomped, trampled, and annihilated my all too important line to get to me. He s crossed that line, and he s coming for me. Dante Use, abuse, and torture London will do anything to hurt me. She s in an unwinnable fight. It s a battle London has no chance of winning, no matter how hard she fights it. I want what I want and I make no apologies for it. She can push me away. She can run, she can hide, but I m one fast motherf****r, and I will always catch her. I want her in my life and that is exactly where she ll be. She ll be right where I put her. There is nothing she can do, because wherever she is, I will be there too. 18+ 65,000 words
