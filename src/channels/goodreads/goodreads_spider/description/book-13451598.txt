13451598:::::Plastic Polly:::::Popularity has its pitfalls, and Polly is discovering them firsthand in this middle-grade M!X novel. Polly Pierce likes being the second-most popular girl at Winston Academy, right after her BFF, Kelsy. Popularity comes with special privileges, like a seat at the best table in the cafeteria and a coveted spot on the planning committee for the school s big talent show competition, Groove It Up! And since all Polly has to do is agree with whatever Kelsy says, being popular is easy even if kids do call her Plastic Polly behind her back. But when a freak accident takes Kelsy out of the picture, Polly is suddenly in charge of the Groove It Up! committee. She s not prepared for her new status and neither is anyone else. Backstabbing friends, an intimidating crush, and diva demands from an injured Kelsy all threaten to derail Polly s plans. Can she prove to everyone and herself that she has a personality of her own?
