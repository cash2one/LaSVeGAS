19904043:::::A World Away:::::A strange land. A glowing sword. And an ancient dragon bent on the destruction of the world. Julianna Foss is abruptly thrust into circumstances she has little hope of understanding. On one side of a great conflict stand the Templars, an ancient warrior order dedicated to protecting the world and on the other side are the Void dragons and their allies the necromancers, who are intent on plunging civilisation into chaos. She alone may hold salvation in her hands in the form of a sword that seems to have an affinity for her. Thrust into a foreign culture where highborn women are objectified, magic is a fact of life and things she never thought possible are reality, every day is a struggle. Tristan Roarke is the gatekeeper. Leader of the Templars he sees something in Julianna and offers a way for her to make a difference, but can she trust him? Deadly with a weapon yet handsome and sensual, he is a risk to Julianna in more ways than one not content for her to just join their side in the fight against the Void, Tristan is making a play for her affections. Can she make it through Templar training with her head and her heart intact? Contains explicit depictions of sex and instances of violence. Not recommended for readers under 18.
