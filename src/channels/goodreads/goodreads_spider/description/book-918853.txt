918853:::::Praise Her in the Gates:::::For a Christian, motherhood is the subtle art of building a house in grace-the wise woman builds her house, but the foolish pulls it down with her hands (Prov. 14:1). Each day's work is significant, for it contributes toward the long-term plan. Each nail helps a house stand in a storm. But motherhood isn't a simple formula. Building a home-childbirth, education, discipline-requires holy joy and a love of beauty. The mother who fears God does not fear the future.
