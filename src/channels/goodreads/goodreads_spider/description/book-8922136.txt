8922136:::::Sharks & Boys:::::Fifteen-year-old Enid's carefully constructed life in Vermont is beginning to crumble. She has come to accept that, after bonding together for years in "twin studies," her friends have betrayed her. And now she finds out that her dad has betrayed her mom. It's not easy, but at least she's got her boyfriend, Wick, to help her through this tough time. Solid, funny, gorgeous Wick. Enid's loved him since she was six, and their relationship is perfect. That is, until Wick suddenly announces he thinks they should take a break, an unclear status that Enid can't accept. As Wick abandons Enid for a trip to Ocean City, Maryland, with those same friends who betrayed her, she lets her wildest fears take over. More than five hundred miles later, Enid realized she's acting desperate as she spies on Wick, his twin, her twin, and all the boys from twin studies. That doesn't stop her from following them aboard a yacht and hiding in the bathroom. But then the boys take the yacht out into a storm-a storm which leaves everyone adrift in the ocean without food or water-and Enid discovers a new definition of desperate . With sharks circling and no help in sight, Enid and the rest of the twins must find a way to trust one another in order to survive-and face the fact that they might not make it home.
