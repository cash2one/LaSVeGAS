24535154:::::Before We Were Strangers:::::For fans of Jojo Moyes and the movie Before Sunrise , a sweeping love story inspired by a real-life missed connections story, from the USA TODAY bestselling author of the romantic women s novels Sweet Thing, Nowhere But Here, and After the Rain. During their senior year of college, in an NYU dorm tucked into the heart of the East Village, Grace and Matt struck up a friendship over Jeff Buckley, Pearl Jam, and the Ramones. She was going to be a world-class cellist and he was going to be a famous photographer, their paths destined to diverge after graduation. Even after an afternoon pub crawl ended in their drunken, spontaneous wedding, their visions for the future never overlapped enough for them to be together. The summer after college, he left his ex-wife on good terms and went to Brazil to work for National Geographic . They vowed to stay in touch and see each other soon. They never did. Fifteen years later, back in New York City, Matt sees Grace as she boards the J train. They re both different in a hundred ways, and yet they re still the same. But just as they recognize each other, just as he understands what he left behind all those years ago, the train pulls away. His only recourse is to send a missed connections letter out in the world, and hope she remembers where to look.
