18298683:::::Return to Source: How Enlightenment is the Process of Creation in the Universe in Reverse:::::The world around us is a magnificent spiritual mystery. Imbued within it, and within us, lie the answers to the questions of existence. In Return to Source by Belsebuub, go on a short and eye-opening journey through the creation myths of ancient peoples from around the world and some of the most famous sacred texts, to discover their remarkable similarities. Belsebuub uncovers that together they reveal a process of life and creation which is timeless, ever-present, and found in the very fabric of the universe. And one that is intrinsically connected to the return of consciousness to the source of creation awakened, called enlightenment. Discover how we too contain the potential of spiritual creation and can use it to reintegrate with divinity, just as people of different cultures and times have. See how the natural world is spiritual in its source, and how everything is ultimately connected, allowing all beings to find their way back to the divine source whenever they choose to look. I tell you truly, the Book of Nature is a Holy Scroll, and if you would have the Sons of Men save themselves and find everlasting life, teach them how once again to read from the living pages of the Earthly Mother. For in everything that is life is the law written. It is written in the grass, in the trees, in rivers, mountains, birds of the sky and fishes of the sea; and most of all within the Son of Man. ~ Jesus, in The Essene Gospel of Peace From the book: Enlightenment follows the process of creation in reverse. The path to enlightenment is to return to the Absolute, the unknowable source of creation. ~ Belsebuub
