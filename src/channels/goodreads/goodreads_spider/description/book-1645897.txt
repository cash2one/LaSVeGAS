1645897:::::The Way Back: Inside the Mind of a Multiple Personality:::::MPD: From the viewpoint of the patient The Way Back is a true story. It's the tremendous victory from the mental illness known as Multiple Personality Disorder. MPD is a strange phenomenon; however, you will read that anyone facing any unwanted circumstance can rise above the fears and difficulty to their desired goal. Those in the field of psychology will most certainly find it to be of great interest. The Way Back is unique in that it is written by a person diagnosed with MPD. In the maze of "the many," as the obstacles of denial, anger, humiliation, shame, fear and hopelessness were removed the integration began. Along the way of the healing process, slowly leaving the old way of thinking in order to embrace the new was the path to being fully restored. Life is about conquering that which we choose to conquer. The greatest blessing of all was that the journey took me right into my Divine Nature.
