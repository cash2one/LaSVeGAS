23430483:::::Cam Girl:::::Vada Bergen is broke, the black sheep of her family, and moving a thousand miles away from home for grad school, but she s got the two things she loves most: her art and her best friend and sometimes more Ellis Carraway. Ellis and Vada have a friendship so consuming it s hard to tell where one girl ends and the other begins. It s intense. It s a little codependent. And nothing can tear them apart. Until an accident on an icy winter road changes everything. Vada is left deeply scarred, both emotionally and physically. Her once-promising art career is cut short. And Ellis pulls away, unwilling to talk about that night. Everything Vada loved is gone. She s got nothing left to lose. So when she meets some smooth-talking entrepreneurs who offer to set her up as a cam girl, she can t say no. All Vada has to do is spend a couple hours each night stripping on webcam, and the tips come pouring in. It s just a kinky escape from reality until a client gets serious. Blue is mysterious, alluring, and more interested in Vada s life than her body. Online, they chat intimately. Blue helps her heal. And he pays well, but he wants her all to himself. No more cam shows. It s an easy decision: she s starting to fall for him. But the steamier it gets, the more she craves the real man behind the keyboard. So Vada pops the question: Can we meet IRL? Blue agrees, on one condition. A condition that brings back a ghost from her past. Now Vada must confront the devastating secrets she's been running from those of others, and those she's been keeping from herself...
