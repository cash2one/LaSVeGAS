24677549:::::Two Truths and a Lie:::::One year ago, I became a missing person. I left everything behind family, friends, school. It seemed like a good idea at the time. My only option, really, until I realized running from a police officer isn t as easy as I thought it would be. It s been exactly three-hundred and sixty-five days since I left home, but I m finally ready to take the step I should have taken a year ago. I m done hiding. I m done running. I m going to take my life back. It was supposed to be easy. A meeting with Jason Pierce, a private investigator, was set up for me. All I had to do was go to him, let him do his thing, and then I could go home, or so I thought. That is, until I met Jason and things got complicated.
