189937:::::Immediatism:::::An irresistible tome from the insurrectionist theoretician, Hakim Bey. His incendiary words are beautifully illustrated by the renowned collage artist Freddie Baer. The result is a delightful compilation by two talented artists. A must read for those who have followed their work for years. In this collection of essays, Bey expounds upon his ideas concerning radical social reorganization and the liberation of desire. Immediatism is another lyrical romp through intellectual corridors of spirituality and politics originally set forth in his groundbreaking book, TAZ . A stunning achievement from this prodigious author and scholar. "A Blake Angel on Acid." Robert Anton Wilson "Fascinating..." William S. Burroughs "Exquisite..." Allen Ginsberg
