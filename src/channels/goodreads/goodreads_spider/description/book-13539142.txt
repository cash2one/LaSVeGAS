13539142:::::Fracture:::::Strange things are happening in the little town of Blessing. Some of the townsfolk are dreaming of angels, others are dreaming of beautiful and seductive creatures. Either way, they are happy, after all this is Blessing. Soon the dreams become a curse. Most people are having headaches and some are dying. An old drunk dies in a camper fire, a young factory worker dies of a drug overdose and a young woman's parents are brutally murdered for no apparent reason. There is a reason, a hunger. A dark hunger that cannot be satisfied by simple food or drink. A hunger that is not from this world. The Couton, an ancient clan of women who feed off the memories of others have come to our world. They have found the fracture that has been kept secret for centuries and now have new feeding ground. They are not alone. An assassin has been sent to our world to bring them back. His mission is to get in and out before he or his prey are discovered. Fate has a different plan for this warrior. He encounters Kristina, the strongwilled young woman whose death of her parents sends her on a collision course with a man who will lead her to discover she is more than meets the eye in both worlds.
