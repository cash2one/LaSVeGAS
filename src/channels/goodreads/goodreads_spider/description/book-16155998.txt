16155998:::::NORTHMAN:::::A TIMELESS LOVE. AN ANCIENT EVIL. THE NORTHMAN IS COMING. Kate is academically brilliant, but trapped in a dead love and a dry career. And she has an unbearable secret. Horrific and inexplicable accidents at a Viking burial site near Repton, England, bring her face to face with unreason and touch the raw nerve of terror within her. But running is not enough. Haunted by the malevolent spirit of a long-dead Viking madman, who pursues her, seeking her out for a consummation at which she can only guess, Kate cannot escape. The haunting is relentless and exists only to harm. In Chicago, an innocent man discovers how much. In Dover, thousands die. Kate can only keep running. Thrown together in Madrid with Michael McLaren - B movie director - the descent into madness begins. Soon, others are trapped in the same web of terror and together they are thrust back 1200 years into 9th century England to face the Northman. Or whatever it is that confronts them. For behind the dead Northman lies something with limitless power, infinitely more dangerous - an ancient evil from the dawn of time bent on erasing mankind. It may mean ultimate conflict. Ultimate sacrifice. For them all.
