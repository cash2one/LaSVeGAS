549756:::::Rocking Horse:::::It's time for the annual Willow Creek Junior High spring dance. Since the dance is open to everyone, the Saddle Club will be there and so will Stevie's boyfriend, Phil. Unfortunately, this also means that Veronica diAngelo will be there. The Saddle Club is determined not to let Veronica ruin their fun. But Veronica has her own plans. She arranges for the Saddle Club to be stuck at Pine Hollow the night of the dance--taking care of her horse, Danny. But when the Saddle Club decides to go to the dance after all, Veronica is the one in for a surprise. They bring Danny with them, proving once and for all that he's a horse with a rock-and-roll soul.
