13569942:::::Strong Woman: Ambition, Grit and a Great Pair of Heels:::::Karren Brady is Britain s best-known business woman. An inspiration to women everywhere, her incredible success is borne of her passion, impressive business instinct, ambition, and her very genuine, honest, down-to-earth outlook. This is her story how she started out as a sparky 18 year old selling advertising space and how she went on to persuade David Sullivan, at the age of 23 to buy a football club turning that business round to sell it for an incredible 82 million 12 years later. How she balances her personal life with her professional, her priorities, her life as mother of two and wife. How she coped when doctors told her after a routine scan that she had a brain anheurysm, that she must have a complicated operation immediately and had a 30% chance of not surviving, and how it has since influenced her outlook and priorities. An overwhelmingly inspiring and real look at work and life, Karren Brady defies convention as a directional business woman in a male industry. This is how she does it, and through her experience, her drive and her skills - it s a brilliant insight into how you can do it too.
