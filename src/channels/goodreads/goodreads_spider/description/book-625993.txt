625993:::::The Star of the South:::::Victor Cyprien, a French engineer currently living in the "Diamond Fields" of Griqualand, South Africa desires to marry the beautiful daughter of Mr. Watkins, a man who holds claims to the land that are the "Diamond Fields." Watkins has other plans for his daughter, which includes her staying in South Africa and marrying one of the wealthier diamond miners. To put himself in a better position to win the hand of Alice, Victor buys a share and begins working his own claim. However, Alice convinces him to return to chemistry and pursue his theory that he can synthesize a diamond. The experiment appears to work as a 243-carat diamond is created and named "The Star of the South," which he gives to Alice. When the diamond is stolen, Cyprien and three other potential suitors for the hand of Alice, travel across South Africa in pursuit of the suspected culprit.
