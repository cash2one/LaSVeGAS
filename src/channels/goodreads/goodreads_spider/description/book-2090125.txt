2090125:::::Assumptions That Affect Our Lives:::::Examining worldview assumptions is critically important to understanding the world and culture in which we live, knowing what to do, and how to "create culture." It is essential that Christ-followers be clear-thinking in these postmodern times. Contrasting the thinking of the ancient Greeks and ancient Hebrews will provide fresh ways to evaluate the messages that continually come our way. Are you aware of the underlying assumptions that shape your values and behavior? Have you given much thought to how your assumptions about what's 'really real' influence your daily actions? We often underestimate the importance of presuppositions that lie behind the values and behavior of ourselves and others. Like an iceberg floating in the ocean with just ten percent visible and ninety percent below the surface, we sometimes lose sight of the fact that words and actions are first shaped by beliefs that lie deep within the reaches of an inner concept of reality called a worldview. Going beyond values and behavior to examine the underlying beliefs and assumptions that shape one's worldview is what this book is all about. Examining worldview assumptions is critically important for understanding the times and the culture in which we live. Assumptions That Affect Our Lives has helped thousands to make a difference in the way they live, by making a difference in the way they think. In a personal letter to the author, Chuck Colson wrote: "I pray the Lord will continue to open every door to get your message to the masses. As the cultural sweep toward postmodern thinking continues to infect our educational institutions, homes and churches, the need for what you are doing is greater today than ever."
