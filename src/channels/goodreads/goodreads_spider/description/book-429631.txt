429631:::::Borderliners:::::Strange things are happening at Biehl's Academy when this elite school opens its doors to a group of orphans and reform-school rejects, kids at the end of the system's tether. The school is run by a peculiar set of rules by which every minute is regimented and controlled. Soon, they suspect they are guinea pigs in a bizarre social experiment and that their only hope of escape is to break through a dangerous threshold of time and space. Peter H eg's "brilliant" and dystopian Borderliners is a "uniquely philosophical thriller" ( Boston Sunday Globe ) and a haunting story of childhood travail and hope.
