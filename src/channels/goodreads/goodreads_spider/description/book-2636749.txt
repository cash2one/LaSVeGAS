2636749:::::The Mulligan:::::The Mulligan is a unique story about a common man. Rich in emotion and filled with unforgettable characters, The Mulligan winds it's way across America's heartland as master storyteller Nathan Jorgenson uses the life of Joe Mix to weave a tapestry colored with laughter, pain, and redemption. After investing much of his life in an unhappy marriage and an unfulfilling career, Dr. Joe Mix realizes that he made most of the important decisions of his life in order to please others, not himself. He married a woman he never loved because she had a stronger will than him. He chose a career that he wasn't interested in because he knew it was what his father expected of him. When the consequences of his wrong decisions threaten to smother him, Joe Mix finally snaps and decides to forsake all that he has done, and set out to reclaim the life he feels he should have chosen. The ensuing odyssey carries him to his childhood home in South Dakota, a cattle ranch in Montana, and ultimately to the end of the road; the banks of a trout stream on an Indian Reservation. We all wonder what our lives could have been, Joe Mix went looking for his life.
