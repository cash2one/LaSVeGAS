10645526:::::Bliss:::::Rosemary Bliss s family has a secret. It s the Bliss Cookery Booke an ancient, leather-bound volume of enchanted recipes like Stone Sleep Snickerdoodles and Singing Gingersnaps. Rose and her siblings are supposed to keep the Cookery Booke under lock and whisk-shaped key while their parents are out of town, but then a mysterious stranger shows up. Aunt Lily rides a motorcycle, wears purple sequins, and whips up exotic (but delicious) dishes for dinner. Soon boring, non-magical recipes feel like life before Aunt Lily a lot less fun. So Rose and her siblings experiment with just a couple of recipes from the forbidden Cookery Booke. A few Love Muffins and a few dozen Cookies of Truth couldn t cause too much trouble . . . could they? Kathryn Littlewood s culinary caper blends rich emotional flavor with truly magical wit, yielding one heaping portion of hilarious family adventure.
