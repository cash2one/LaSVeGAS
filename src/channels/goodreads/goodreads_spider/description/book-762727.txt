762727:::::Beasts:::::A young woman tumbles into a nightmare of decadent desire and corrupted innocence in a superb novella of suspense from National Book Award winner Joyce Carol Oates. Art and arson, the poetry of D. H. Lawrence and pulp pornography, hero-worship and sexual debasement, totems and taboos mix and mutate into a startling, suspenseful tale of how a sunny New England college campus descends into a lurid nightmare. "A small gem.... Oates does not disappoint, nor does she waste a word." The Washington Post Book World Oates often takes on sensational subject matter ... yet rarely has she done so with the churningly quiet understatement of ... Beasts." Los Angeles Times "A cunning fusion of Gothic romance and psychological horror story, and one of her best recent books." Kirkus Reviews "Oates's new novel is a slim one, but it packs a serious punch." Associated Press "Delicious ... Beasts is something of a jeu d'esprit noir.... The novella length is exactly right for it." The New York Review of Books
