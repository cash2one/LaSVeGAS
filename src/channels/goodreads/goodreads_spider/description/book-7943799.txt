7943799:::::Following Richard Brautigan:::::Following Richard Brautigan is, among other things, a ghost story. It is also a love story, a road novel, a romancer's romance and an alleviative threnody. It is long on hope and short on structure. It is, in the words of David Swing, the world's truth with a beautiful woman walking through it. It is made out of watermelon sugar.
