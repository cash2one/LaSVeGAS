36035175:::::Republic's Chosen:::::The world had never seen utopias until the Latin Republic was established. Equality, respect, humane treatment all of those drive the society's philosophy after the Great Disaster. Yet humanity has not learned to leave war behind. When the Republic sends summons to Liana, she knows it s illegal. Her immigrant status forbids her from fighting in the army, but the country s leaders want control over her and they won t stop at anything to get it. Under the pressure of a tough training regime, threatened by a complicated political plot she must quickly untangle, it is no surprise Liana s marriage begins to crumble. Tossed in a training campus and immediately involved in its intrigue, Liana needs allies quickly, but all she wants to do is crush the system which holds her hostage. With each passing day, it s becoming harder to reconcile the need to hide her real identity and the desire to protect her immigrant countryfolk from harm. An old friend returns to her life just in time to give her the leverage she needs. There is no chance she s ever coming back to her peaceful life in hiding. A strong bisexual lead, a secret identity, Special Forces soldiers, true friendship, and a headstrong trauma survivor trying to accept her role in saving the world.
