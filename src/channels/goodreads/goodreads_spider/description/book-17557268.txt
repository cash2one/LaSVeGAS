17557268:::::Angelface:::::Angelface is a memoir of a love unlike any other the world has seen. It tells of a passion of such profound intensity that, perhaps, no-one has ever felt as deeply. Valentine is a young man, quite content with his life, until, one day, he meets a girl, by chance, who completely upends his world. Karina is a young virginal student from Peru, living in London, for reasons unknown. With just one glance of her strange Incan beauty, Valentine is bewitched. From that moment on, his every thought is of her, his every feeling, his every dream. He is completely overwhelmed by an unaccountably powerful love. Yet, Karina is a mystery. Everything about her is elusive. Valentine is led on a mystery of the Heart, to discover the truth of the one he has come to love, so unexpectedly. Why is she so mysterious? What is the truth of her life? How can he love someone who seems so indefinable? They share a mutual uncontrollable passion indeed, neither has known feelings so irresistible in their lives. Yet, always, there is the presence of the shadow of the unknown. This is the true story of a great love. Valentine spent six years, at night, alone in a room, writing this book, after the last day he ever saw Karina. Its six volumes extend to approximately 750,000 words making this one of the longest books ever written in the English language and perhaps the longest book of love, in any language, in history. It serves as a memorial to one lost, but ever loved. It is published nineteen years to the day, after Valentine last saw Karina. Note: this work contains erotic passages, though always intrinsic to the development of the story. This volume contains 121,521 words. It is the first of a six volume work.
