Echo and Noah share everything except the one thing Echo s just not ready for. But when the source of Echo s constant nightmares comes back into her life, she has to make some tough decisions about what she really wants even as foster kid Noah s search for his last remaining relatives forces them both to confront some serious truths about life, love, and themselves. Now, with one week left before college orientation, jobs and real life, Echo must decide if Noah's more than the bad-boy fling everyone warned her he'd be. And the last leg of an amazing road trip will turn... seriously epic.
