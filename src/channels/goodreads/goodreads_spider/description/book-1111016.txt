1111016:::::The Twelfth Transforming:::::No period in Egyptian history has been the source of so much fascination as the reign of Akhenaten, the XVIII Dynasty pharaoh whose impetuous government took his country to the brink of disaster. In The Twelfth Transforming , Pauline Gedge tells the rich and dramatic story of Akhenaten's catastrophic rule -- and of the Empress Tiye, whose efforts to save her beloved country from her pharaoh son unwittingly bring a curse upon the land. In scene after scene, ancient Egypt comes vividly to life: the splendour of the imperial courts; the unrelenting heat of the desert; the misery wrought upon the land when the life-giving Nile fails in its annual inundation. The Twelfth Transforming is historical fiction at its finest, an epic of a ruler, a dynasty, and a people confronting their glorious and tragic destiny.
