18871456:::::Love Is Overdue:::::Gabriela Pereira has spent the majority of her 27 years tending to her ailing mother, and in doing so has put most of her hopes, dreams and aspirations for the future on permanent hold. She is constantly tormented by the guilt of being the only one left to care for her mother, who has suffered through unimaginable trauma in the past - both emotional and physical. The possibility of finding love has also become a distant fantasy for Gabby, not likely to come true any time soon either, until she meets Benjamin Martin - a handsome, charismatic, intelligent, successful, funny, and so very tasty (quite literally and figuratively speaking) man - who owns the Caribbean restaurant next door to her office. He is the kind of guy that seems too good to be true. This sort of thing doesn't happen to her... Passion, lust, heartache and loss all collide into one mouth-watering read when a shy and lonely Brazilian-Canadian girl finds love in a handsome, charismatic Jamaican-Canadian chef among the diverse sights, sounds and food of Vancouver's eclectic Commercial Drive. It is hard not to fall in love with Gabby and Ben as they try to reconcile their inner demons to be together against all odds.
