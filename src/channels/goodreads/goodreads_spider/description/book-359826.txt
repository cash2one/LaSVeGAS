359826:::::The Followers:::::Who are the followers of the Sith? Devoted to the study of the dark side of the Force, they live an underground existence . . . but their threat is growing. Although they do not have Sith power, they are on a constant search for it. Nothing--not even the Jedi--will get in their way. Dr. Lundi is the leader of the Sith followers. As he gets closer to attaining a Sith Holocron, he comes face-to-face with Qui-Gon Jinn and his apprentice Obi-Wan. Ten years later, when the Sith followers reappear, Obi-Wan and his own apprentice, Anakin Skywalker, must rely on Lundi to help them. But he is to be feared, not trusted. The Sith are on the rise. The Jedi must stop them.
