To Write Love on Her Arms (TWLOHA) is an American non-profit organization which aims to present hope for people struggling with self injury, suicide, depression, and addiction. Based in Cocoa, Florida, TWLOHA seeks to connect people to treatment centers, websites, books, support groups, and other resources. TWLOHA also encourages people to have honest conversations about these issues, to live in community, and to seek help for these treatable conditions.A large portion of the work is dedicated to bridging the gap between traditional treatment (i.e. rehab, counseling, helplines) and the lives of people who need help. Examples of this include music festivals and tours, social networking sites, and schools and universities.
