25379420:::::Solar Arc Directions:::::Very little has been written about solar arc in astrological literature. This book fills that need and is dedicated to isolating it as a major tool in showing turning points in people's lives. Although solar arc is commonly known as a reliable astrological predictive technique, this book goes further by describing patterns within the process. Using ordinary people's charts, it is demonstrated and verified by actual case histories. Also, it explains how solar arc can be valuable in mundane charts, as well as showing turning points and passages in relationships by applying it to composite charts, and how it can be used in the rectification of birth times. Above all, in the chapter entitled "The Mid-Life Shift Into Reverse", Ms. Devine's discovery that our lives repeat in reverse order after age 45 is an original breakthrough.
