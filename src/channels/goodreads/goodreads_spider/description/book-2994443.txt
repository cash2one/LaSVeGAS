2994443:::::Inside Egypt: The Land of the Pharaohs on the Brink of a Revolution:::::The government of Egypt banned Inside Egypt in 2008 the first time a book on Egyptian politics had been banned in the country in decades and quickly rescinded it after the media firestorm that followed. The book depicts the country before the collapse, and then explores recent events in Egypt and the realization of the predicted revolution. Through interviews with ordinary Egyptians and extensive travels in the country, Bradley reveals why Egypt was vulnerable to a popular uprising and how it could bring about an Iranian-style theocracy in a country once noted for its plurality and tolerance.
