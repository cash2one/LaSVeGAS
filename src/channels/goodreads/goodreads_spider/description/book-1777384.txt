1777384:::::The Shattered Rose:::::She is the incomparable Jehanne, alone in a castle with a child who is not her husband's. He is Galeran of Heywood, believed dead in a far-off land, newly returned to his country to reclaim his land --- and his errant wife. Proud and unyielding, Jehanne refuses to beg forgiveness from the husband she has unknowingly betrayed ... yet secretly loves with all her heart. Enraged and wounded by her cruel faithlessness, Galeran cannot ask for what he longs most to have: Jehanne back in his arms --- his bed --- his life.
