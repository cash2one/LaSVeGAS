21083784:::::Selfish Whining Monkeys: How we Ended Up Greedy, Narcissistic and Unhappy:::::With a sharp eye for the magnificently absurd, Rod Liddle sets light to modern-day Britain. One of Britain s funniest, most daring columnists. If he weren t so offensive you d almost call him a national treasure Mail on Sunday I, and my generation, seem feckless and irresponsible, endlessly selfish, whining, avaricious, self-deluding, self-obsessed, spoiled and corrupt and ill. What is it that has transformed the British who in living memory were admired for their unassuming, stiff-upper-lipped capacity for `muddling through' into the feckless, obese, self-deluding, avaricious and self-obsessed whingers we have become? Savagely funny and relentlessly contrary, yet with a poignant sense of all that we have lost, Rod Liddle mercilessly exposes the absurdity, cant and humbuggery of the way we live now.
