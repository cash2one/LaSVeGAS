10259337:::::Danny Williams: The War with Ottawa:::::John Efford . . . roared down from Ottawa to St. John s and issued his famous ultimatum to Danny Williams on Paul Martin s latest offer on the Accord: Take it or leave it. Danny s comeback? Let me answer Mr. Efford loud and clear. We will leave it, thank you very much. And the war with Ottawa rocketed upwards. In 2004, Danny Williams, premier of Newfoundland and Labrador, hired veteran politico and popular radio talk-show host Bill Rowe to represent his province s interests in Ottawa. This memoir covers the eight months Rowe served with Premier Williams during what became widely known as the Atlantic Accord Crisis and a bitter, long-lasting feud between Williams and the top brass on Parliament Hill. Combining high drama and hard-hitting analysis of the ruthless game of federal politics with hilarious commentary on the very human side of those involved, Danny Williams: The War With Ottawa is the story of a defining time for Williams and his political career . . . and the story of a premier every Canadian came to love or hate. Bill Rowe is a broadcaster, lawyer and former politician in Newfoundland and Labrador. A Rhodes Scholar, he earned a Master of Arts in Law from the University of Oxford.
