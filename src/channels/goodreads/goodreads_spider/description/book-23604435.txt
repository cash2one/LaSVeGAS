They don t seem to understand that IceWings, the most superior of all dragon tribes, can fix their own problems. When their search leads the dragonets straight into Queen Scarlet s vicious talons, Winter is grateful to have some help. But even the bravest dragons can t follow him to the Ice Kingdom, where he ll have to face the greatest threat of all: his own family.
