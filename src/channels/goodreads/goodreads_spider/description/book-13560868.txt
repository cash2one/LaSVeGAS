13560868:::::The Language of Light:::::It is possible to communicate with every person on the planet, regardless of what language they speak. This fully illustrated mind drawing workbook takes the reader on an inner journey by tapping into the language of their soul. When the soul descended from the higher spiritual plane and took on human form, the individual lost their memory of how to access the Language of Light. Written as a companion piece to her Awakening series, Nadine May offers the reader an opportunity to awaken those lost memories and as a result achieve a higher level of consciousness. Guiding the reader through the five stages of creativity, Nadine provides the tools to understanding the subconscious through the drawings that one produces and hence makes it possible to connect with the soul on a much deeper level and makes the process of awakening that much easier. Mind drawing and doodling takes the reader on a creative journey about themselves. By learning how to interpret and understand the symbolic language and the colour vibrations of their own drawings, a symbolic language appears. These symbols form an expression of a soul quality. Each person is born with many soul qualities, but they are often not expressed. Through drawing them out, their vibrations will help the artist to awaken to their true being. for more info or to buy: http://www.kimaglobalbooks.com/thelan...
