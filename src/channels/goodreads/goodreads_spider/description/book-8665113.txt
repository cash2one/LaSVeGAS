8665113:::::Demon Song:::::Bodyguard Celia Graves plies her trade in a world where bloodthirsty vampires roam the night and street-corner psychics have real powers. A vamp attack turned Celia into a unique creature who finds sunlight painful and who must take all her food in liquid form but who still retains her human heart, mind, and soul. The attack also awakened a hidden part of her heritage: Celia is part Siren, able to enthrall men and enrage women without half-trying. Needless to say, her bodyguard business has taken off: who wouldn t want to be protected by a sexy, extremely capable woman who is half-vampire, half-Siren princess? An ancient rift between the demonic dimension and our own, sealed during the destruction of Atlantis, begins to open and threatens to loose all the demons of hell on humanity (including the one personally bent on destroying Celia). Celia s recent hellish experiences may have given her the unique combination of abilities needed to close the rift. But to overcome a death curse that nearly guarantees her failure, she ll need to join forces with people she no longer trusts and put people she has come to care about directly in harm s way.
