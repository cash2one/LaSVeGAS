22315043:::::The Legislated Types of Jihaad and the Deviation of the Extremists:::::Shaykh Saalih Ibn Saalih al-Fawzaan clarifies the issues related to Jihaad. He begins by establishing its place in the history of mankind. He then explains the wisdom behind its legislation, its linguistic and religious meanings, and the different rulings and regulations pertaining to its performance. Shaykh Abdul-Azeez Aalish-Shaykh praises Shaykh Fawzaan s clarification of this oft-misunderstood issue: Saalih has spoken in this place about the types of Jihaad, the rules of each type, what is necessary for the Muslim concerning this matter, what the obligatory Jihaad is, and what the non-obligatory Jihaad is. He also answered the questioners questions with legitimate answers that contain insight for he who desires clear-sightedness [tabassur] [regarding this issue]. Also included in the Appendices are clarifications from Shaykh Fawzaan and Imaam al-Albaanee that the terrorism perpetrated today by so-called jihaad groups is far removed from the jihaad sanctioned by Allaah ('azza wa jal) and his Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam). That these groups are not influenced by the Noble Qur an and the Sunnah of the Messenger (sallallaahu alayhi wa sallam) but by deviated ideologies foreign to Islam.
