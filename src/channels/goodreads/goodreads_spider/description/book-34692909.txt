34692909:::::The Selection:::::Humans colonized the planet Kepler 186f after Earth's near total global collapse. Soon after, supply missions ended leaving the colonists to themselves, renaming the planet Anastasia and building a new society far different than Earth's. As population imbalance threatened stability in the settlements, a horrific and brutal institution known as The Selection was created. Centuries later, haunted by the screams of his dead older brother, eighteen year-old Eron fears the unknown terror waiting for him and all boys his age in The Selection. He has thirty days to survive to Victory Point and reunite with his crush Mina. He will have to endure brutal circumstances and forge unlikely alliances if he's to survive The Selection. Time is short. Threats are constant. Survival means life. Failure means death-or worse.
