436745:::::Fallen Angels:::::The Lazenders, a gilded family, have been the envy and pride of Britain for centuries. But Toby Lazender, the heir, is now mysteriously absent. His sister, Campion, is running the family estates in his absence. But Lazen Castle is, unknowingly, a house under siege. The Fallen Angels - among the most powerful and dangerous men in Europe - are plotting to bring revolution to England. To succeed, they need money, and the Lazender fortune can provide it. A web of deceit closes around Lazen, drawing Campion ever closer to a subtle trap that has been laid for her. Her only hope for survival lies with the Gypsy - her brother's aloof horse-master - a man whose loyalties have always been uncertain. Fallen Angels is a powerful blend of passion, adventure and intrigue, played out in the shadow of the guillotine and the sunlit splendour of an English estate. It is a great successor to A Crowning Mercy , the first chronicle of the Lazender family.
