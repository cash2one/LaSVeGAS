11441:::::Short Cuts: Selected Stories:::::The nine stories and one poem collected in this volume formed the basis for the astonishingly original film Short Cuts directed by Robert Altman. Collected altogether in this volume, these stories form a searing and indelible portrait of American innocence and loss. From the collections Will You Please Be Quiet, Please? , Where I m Calling From , What We Talk About When We Talk About Love , and A New Path to the Waterfall ; including an introduction by Robert Altman. With deadpan humor and enormous tenderness, this is the work of one of the true contemporary masters ( The New York Review of Books ). From the eBook edition.
