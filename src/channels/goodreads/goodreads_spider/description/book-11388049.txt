11388049:::::Saturdays Are Gold:::::Two children growing up in 1940s South Africa are told to stay away from lonely places because there is a child abductor on the loose. What could possibly go wrong? Young Maudie doesn t realise she has a gift that seems more like a curse to her brother Tadpole who is the only person aware of it. If Roald Dahl, Gerald Durrell and Stephen King had teamed up to write a South African version of To Kill a Mockingbird they might have produced something like this. A moving, exciting, sometimes scary, sometimes laugh-out-loud funny adventure set against a South African backdrop so well described it is almost a character in its own right. When you finish this book, the first thing you will want to do is read it again.
