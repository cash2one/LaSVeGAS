5026173:::::La Dame aux Camelias:::::Marguerite Gautier is the most beautiful, brazen and expensive courtesan in all of Paris. Despite being ill with consumption, she lives a glittering, moneyed life of nonstop parties and aristocratic balls and savors every day as if it were her last. Into her life comes Armand Duval. Young, handsome, and recklessly headstrong, he is hopelessly in love with Marguerite, but not nearly rich enough. Yet Armand is Marguerite s first true love, and against her better judgment, she throws away her upper-class lifestyle for him. But as intense as their love for each other is, it challenges a reality that cannot be denied. This Signet Classics version is the only available paperback edition of Camille , a story as old as time and as timeless as love itself. Translated by Sir Edmond Gosse, with an Introduction by Toril Moi Includes Photos
