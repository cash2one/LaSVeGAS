289659:::::Sarah's Song:::::The ritual is the same every December: Twelve handmade paper ornaments and a small plastic Christmas tree. Twelve days for Sarah to remember her long-ago love from the place where she now lives, her small boxy room at Greer Retirement Village. Twelve chances for Sarah to sing her song once more . . . Every year Sarah Lindeman celebrates Christmas in a special way. It is her time to remember where she came from and what she is today, and how that long ago song gave her another chance at love. But this year the ritual is different. This year a desperate young woman is listening, a nurse who lingers by the door as Sarah places the first yellowed ornament on her tiny tree. Sarah feels the hurt in this woman's soul and reaches out to her. Her hope is that she can do something to help both of them. And so she sings. Each day she hangs a paper ornament on her tree and relives a chapter of her story, drawing her new friend into the hallways of yesterday and a love that rose and fell, only to bloom again stronger than ever. Sarah knows the heartache that results from making bad choices. And she knows, too, how God can redeem any situation, her own life is proof of that. As Sarah sings, she prays her new friend will understand the true gift of love, and that to give it up without a fight means to give up on life itself. But will Sarah be able to convince this troubled young woman before time runs out? Twelve days. Two lives. And one song, "Sarah's Song", that just might bring about a miracle for everyone watching.
