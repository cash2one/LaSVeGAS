6310629:::::Jonas:::::Jonas Luciano is the new owner of The Dungeon, a newly renovated, vampire-themed bondage and blood club. He also has his hands full protecting Michael, the new padrone of the Italian vampiro cosca in Collins Bay, Florida. He is perfectly content to carry out Michael's orders and scramble the brain of anyone who threatens their safety. But protecting Tori, Michael's drop-dead sexy new compagna, is proving dangerous to his self-control. His lust becomes more powerful every night he is with her? Dr. Elena Jensen is an immunohematologist with DIACorp, the world's leading medical research facility. Poised to culminate her life's work, she's on the eve of a speech to announce the groundbreaking discovery of a new immune system booster for humans that will revolutionize the medical industry (and the lives of every human on earth). Elena and Jonas's worlds couldn't be farther apart. But when the Council discovers a plot to kidnap Elena and the formula, Jonas jumps at the chance to become her guardian angel--and get away from his family. Will Jonas manage to protect Elena from the Bureau without breaking the Alleanza? Or will Elena's obstinacy be enough to drive the dominating beast out of the shadows?
