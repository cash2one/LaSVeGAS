19194589:::::Spice God:::::From the author of The Academy Series! When Melody ran away from a drugged out ex-husband and a controlling mother, she needed a new home and a new job. A thriving and posh hideaway, Juniper Island held a promise to be the change she needed. Directed to the North Shore by the locals, she meets Tonac, an unusual chef and owner of the Mayana restaurant. He gives his delicious meals away for free, and doesn't serve people what they want, only what they need. When Melody tastes the food for the first time, she finds out why the customers kept coming back despite the strangeness. The food influences people in unique ways, sometimes sharing visions, sometimes gently nudging people to encourage bravery, kindness, even charity. Tonac takes her on as a waitress, but under his care, she comes face-to-face with the secret of who he really is. Not all of the residents of Juniper Island are happy with Tonac. When Melody gets caught up in the middle, it'll take more than a few spiced apple tarts or a helping of pumpkin soup to uncover the deeper secrets that some people on Juniper Island wants to keep buried.
