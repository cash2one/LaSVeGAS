3680404:::::Mistress of Redemption:::::The white-collar life Jonathan Powell created for himself is gone. Standing outside Wentworth prison after serving his five-year sentence, he knows he has to start over. No more hooking up with Dominant women so he can enjoy the challenge of screwing up their minds. But who knew his last target would be a psychopathic killer who tried to off two cops? No, it wasn't the game that was the problem. He just made some key mistakes. Mistakes he won't make again. Then Mistress Dona shows up to give him a ride from the prison into his new life, and his resolve goes out the window. She's everything he can't resist. Dona knows she has to help Jonathan make the right choice this time, because Hell doesn't offer options. He has to understand and accept what surrender truly means. His only hope is a Mistress of Redemption. The problem is she may lose her own soul in the attempt to save his. Fifth in the Nature of Desire Series (features Jonathan from Natural Law). Reader Advisory: This book contains a very gritty and frank journey to Hell and contains many BDSM elements. Some of the situations and scenes may be disturbing to some readers. It is not for the faint of heart.
