12432550:::::Valiant:::::Tammy has always tried to be prepared for any calamity life might send her way, but a sexy, lion man-beast is way outside the norm. He s huge, has the most exotic, golden cat-eyes she s ever seen and she s so terrified of him, she s speechless for the first time in her life. He s stalking closer, growling at her, and she s too unnerved to even flee. Valiant has always hated humans. But when he gets a whiff of the adorable human female who has invaded his territory, he s forced to reexamine his feelings on the matter. Her fear scents of pure, sweet temptation and the closer he gets, the more appealing she becomes. Once he s got his hands on her, he isn t about to let go. One thought will change his life. MINE! Before Tammy can regain her senses, she s flat on her back in Valiant s bed. Now he just has to use every inch of his big, buff body to convince her to stay with him forever.
