18192663:::::Knight & Day:::::Kara Brookes hates liars. Dylan Day hasn't told the truth from the moment his plane touched down in Ibiza. It's a recipe for disaster. Romantic, emotional and intensely erotic, Knight &amp; Day is the thrilling final installment of the USA Today bestselling Knight Series from Kitty French. Lucien and Sophie are back, and have set up camp on the sun-drenched isle of Ibiza for the opening of the latest of Lucien's strictly adult clubs. They're joined for the summer by Sophie's best friend Kara, and Dylan Day, Lucien's newly appointed club manager. The laid back, smokin' hot surf guy from California seems almost too good to be true... but there's no smoke without fire. It's going to be a long hot summer of love, lust, lies and wedding bells. But who will get their happy ever after? Knight &amp; Day is the thrilling conclusion to the USA Today best-selling Knight erotic trilogy. Whilst it can be read as a stand alone story, it's best enjoyed as the finale of the set.
