18050794:::::Amish Christmas Joy:::::One minute, Caleb Mast is an oil-rig roughneck who answers to no one but himself. The next, he's the father of a special-needs child he never knew existed. What kind of home can a man like him without faith or community provide for an eight-year-old girl? For little Joy's sake, Caleb returns to the Amish community he left behind years ago.

With Christmas weeks away, one special girl just may bring two hearts and an entire community together.
