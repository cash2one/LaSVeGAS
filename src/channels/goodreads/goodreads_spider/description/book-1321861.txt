1321861:::::The Natives Are Restless:::::In the tradition of its best-selling predecessor "Darkest England", Shah continues his brilliantly funny look at the English and those who would try to understand them. The author's background gives him a uniquely Eastern and Western perspective from which he weaves a tapestry of characters, commentaries and anecdotes drawn from his many years as an observer of the English mentality. Shah shares unusually personal stories from his life as a widely respected author, thinker and advisor. Joining with him are celebrities, treasure-hunters, expatriates, royals, pseudo-royals and an unforgettable parade of internationals. Together they share a look at the misunderstandings, scholarly absurdities and comic paradoxes of England and the rest of our ever-shrinking world.
