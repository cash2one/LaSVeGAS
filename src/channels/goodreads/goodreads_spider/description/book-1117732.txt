1117732:::::The Hugo Winners Vol 1 and 2 1955-1972:::::The Hugo Award is to science fiction what the Oscar is to Hollywood, and every year the coveted statuette (modeled after a spaceship) is presented at the World Science Fiction Convention. Here are twenty-three award-winning stories for the years 1955 to 1970, each with an introduction by Isaac Asimov. All the stories are unusual and contain that special something that marks them as a prize winners. Highly original and provocative, they examine the mystery of existence and the very real possibilities that lie within the realm of future experience. And together they provide a lavish treat of the very best writing chosen by the most prominent people in the field - truly superior science fiction. Contents: The Darfsteller by Walter M.
