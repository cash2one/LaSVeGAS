1310835:::::Love, Sexuality and Matriarchy: About Gender:::::Now in paperback-by the bestselling author of The Art of Loving. One of the world's most widely read psychologists, Erich Fromm was a groundbreaking thinker on gender and sex, issues that have come to have a profound impact on psychology. He believed that a state of war has existed between the sexes for some six thousand years-a "guerrilla war" that followed the triumph of men over women and reorganized society on the basis of male domination. This state of war, Fromm said, is at the core of the problems between men and women. Throughout his life Fromm wrote about gender, but never collected these writings in one volume. Love, Sexuality and Matriarchy brings together for the first time his most significant contributions on the subject.
