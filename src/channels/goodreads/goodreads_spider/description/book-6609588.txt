6609588:::::Morning's Refrain:::::Phoebe Robbins quickly realizes that her life in Sitka, Alaska, will be a far cry from what she knew in the East. The weather seems to be constantly rainy, goods are often scarce, and there's little entertainment, save the small orchestra she joins. There are also plenty of men actively seeking a wife, but it is Dalton Lindquist--with his swarthy good looks--who is the most intriguing part of this isolated existence. Despite their unusual first encounter, Phoebe dares to hope that the spark she feels between them is returned in equal measure. When Yuri Belikov, Dalton's best friend, begins to pursue her, Phoebe finds herself in a precarious position. Did she misread Dalton's interest? How will her decision between the two men affect their friendship? And what of the long-buried secret in her own family's past? In the challenges ahead, Phoebe will learn of consequence and forgiveness...and the power of love.
