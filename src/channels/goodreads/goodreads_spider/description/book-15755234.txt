15755234:::::This is Who I Am:::::When trying to save a woman from slavers, Sam screwed up. Royally. Now Linda wants nothing to do with him. Or with BDSM. She won t even admit she s a masochist. As a dominant and sadist, he can give her what she needs, and when an opportunity arises, he slips into her life, intending to make amends. She s everything he knew she would be except for her bullheaded determination to be normal . Now the horrible time is past, Linda just wants to return to her small conservative town, pick up her quiet life, and be normal. But how can someone who likes pain be normal ? To her dismay, when someone spray-paints her home with obscenities, Sam shows up to rescue her. Again. Doesn t he understand that the last thing she needs in her life is a sadist? He s amused by her objections. But his dry sense of humor can t disguise that he s tough as nails and dominant and stubborn. He s not going to let her drive him off this time. Soon she realizes she wants him to stay. When he takes her to the Shadowlands, she feels as if she s found a home until she hears a voice from out of her nightmares.
