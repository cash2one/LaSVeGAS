24958079:::::Mermen:::::These Mermen Don t Have Tails, They re Deadly as Hell, and They ve Got Something He Wants INFAMOUS BACHELOR and SELF-MADE BILLIONAIRE ROEN DORAN IS A BASTARD. Yes, he knows it. And no, he doesn t care. He s got money and power, and he depends on no one. But when his estranged father dies, willing him a secret island, Roen will come face to face with an even bigger secret: its occupants. And these savage, sea-obsessed warriors are quick to make their position clear: Leave now or die. There s only one problem. Nobody tells Roen what to do. Ever. Oh, and one other thing. He s just met the island s other new guest and something about her brings out his possessive side. SOLE SHIPWRECK SURVIVOR LIV STRATTON had been adrift at sea for ten grueling days when salvation miraculously appeared: an uncharted island. Only, the deceivingly beautiful men who live there aren t interested in saving her. No, not at all. Because they somehow believe she is their property, a gift from the ocean to do with as they please. This is not good. Her only hope? Billionaire Roen Doran, of all people. A man who s said to care for nothing and no one. But if he s so heartless, then why is he about to risk everything to help her?
