2313623:::::The Far Pavilions Part 1 Of 2:::::Part One Of Two Parts From the foothills of the Himalayas to the bone-strewn Khyber pass, M.M. Kaye weaves a vast, rich and vibrant tapestry of love and war. Spanning 25 of the 19th century's most turbulent years, it is a story of hatred and bitter combat; of courage, cowardice and sacrifice; of the star-crossed wedding of East and West; and, above all, of a love that transcends time and place. "One of the great literary triumphs of 20th century letters and the screen. Stands with the Forsyth Saga and other great narrative epics of our era. Unconditionally recommended." (B-O-T Editorial Review Board)
