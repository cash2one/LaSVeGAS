36097796:::::Points of View:::::In the POINTS OF VIEW series, the hero is a young blind Londoner, named Horace Mayberry, who is a cautious lad, who occasionally enjoys vivid dreams of being a secret agent. Then he becomes fitted with superhuman, nanotronic, eyes for free, but there is a catch.. They are inherently intelligent and can develop various functions to assist in whatever awkward situations he experiences. In payment for the eyes, he is recruited into a secret government agency as an apprehensive assistant to an experienced agent and embarks on a series of adventures, including being abducted twice by an international gang of terrorists. Their leader, Rudolph Beckman, is a billionaire financier who is after the secrets of the laboratory that developed the nanotronic eyes. He uses a trio of henchmen to do his bidding. Each risky situation Horace encounters causes his eyes to develop something new, and enables his introvert personality to evolve too. His dreams become more meaningful as he becomes somewhat impulsive and headstrong. The exciting finale in this first volume covers an attack by the two agents, backed up by a Spanish SWAT team, on the crooks hideout in Tenerife, one of the Canary Islands!
