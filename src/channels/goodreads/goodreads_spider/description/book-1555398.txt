1555398:::::The Mark of the Vampire Queen:::::When he becomes Lady Lyssa s full servant, Jacob crosses the threshold into a darker relationship with her than he s known before. His time as a vampire hunter certainly hadn t prepared him to embrace a world where humans are sexual commodities, but he adapted. Now he finds the integrity of his soul challenged as he serves his Mistress s needs as fully as he services her desires. The vampire world believes human servants are inferior, a vital source for their varying appetites. Jacob knows a human servant is far more than that. His Mistress needs a warrior, a friend and a lover. A man who will serve her in all ways, even if he has to betray the priceless treasure of her love.
