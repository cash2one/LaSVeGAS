Charlie Hudson was on the verge of figuring that out when her dad the only parent and friend she ever had died suddenly. She was barely 18, and she was alone. So she went for easy playing life safe, running away from a home that harbored nothing but bad memories and challenges and loving a man who would take her away from it all forever. It s funny how chance takes over when you need it most. And that s exactly what brought Cody Carmichael into her life. A former motocross super star, Cody was now happy to be living the blue collar life, spending his days finishing up school and his nights under the hood of some classic car, just trying to keep everything his father taught him alive. Cody and Charlie were living parallel lives, until they finally collided. And the moment he smiled at her, Charlie knew he was the one who would change everything. But was she willing to take the risk? Cody saw through it all. He saw her all of her. But would letting him in be too much to take? And if Charlie let herself love him really love him could he love her back?
