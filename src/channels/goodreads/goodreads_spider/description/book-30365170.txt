30365170:::::Impending Earth:::::Three moons lit our night skies back home. We named them Initius, Magnus, and Fortitus, for the first to rise, the strongest to shed light, and the last to disappear in the morning hours. I miss our moons still, and I long dreadfully for the way things used to be, but I do not miss what my home had become in its last days, the days before we were forced to leave in an effort to save our very lives. My entire existence at home was, at one time, filled with peace, the lives of myself and my three friends, even though the four of us were considered the middle dregs of our society. I have much to share about our former home, and more to tell regarding why we are no longer there. It is this pride, this lack of both internal and external consciousness, that demanded we flee for our very lives, and this is the story I will relate to you now. My name is Dyzek, my three companions and I come from the planet Marmara in the Copetus galaxy. At one time, many, many moons ago, all of the peoples of Marmara were free, or so we thought, which resulted in our need to escape the impending oppression. I record these truths for those of the future, my children . The four of us, my family , desire for those who will come after us and inhabit this new found world, we call Earth , to learn of this murderous pride which occupies the heart and soul of every being in our species. There may not be another world to run to if our history repeats itself
