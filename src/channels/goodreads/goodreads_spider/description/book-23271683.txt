23271683:::::Reckless:::::Everything about him warned me to stay away. I'd seen bad boys before, but he had it all and more. The rippling muscles covered in tatts, the piercing eyes hiding dark secrets, the silky voice that could make a girl come with just a whisper . . . He was exactly the type of guy that would get me in trouble, but when he jumped off the stage, inked skin glistening with sweat and breathed his seductive words into my ear, I couldn't resist the temptation. It was supposed to be the best one-night stand of my life, but fate didn't let it play out that way. Things happened. I got upset. I got hasty. And worst of all, I got reckless. After that disaster, I thought it was the last I'd see of him. But what I didn't know was that I'd started something. Something that could shatter the very thing I had worked so hard to protect. I should have known back then that the most seductive things in life are also the most dangerous. Note: This is not a standalone book, it is an extended teaser for the full length novel: Reckless (The Forever Series).
