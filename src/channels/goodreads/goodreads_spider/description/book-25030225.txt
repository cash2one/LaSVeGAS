25030225:::::Sucker:::::#1 Best Seller on Amazon. Van H. Avram, PI, stumbles from case to case, getting by on his good looks and appeal to desperate dames. But when a missing-person case dumps the body of a skinny blond thing on his doorstep, he finds himself plummeting into the clutches of an underworld intent on human sacrifice. An underworld of biblical origin. An ancient evil rises up to destroy the world and, without asking for it, Van is thrust into the role of savior. As reality and the occasional building collapses around him, he s chased, battered, and seduced by demons, vampires and unhinged women, all against a background of a war-ravished world wrapped up in vintage fashions and flying diesel-powered vehicles. Time ticks down to a do-or-die moment as the fate of the universe is decided in one final battle. But to save the universe, Van must face his own demons and an unremembered past. For fans of Terry Pratchett, Neil Gaiman, and Douglas Adams.
