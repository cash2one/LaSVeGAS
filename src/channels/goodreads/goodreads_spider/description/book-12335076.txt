12335076:::::Embrace:::::A magical destiny to embrace in this enchanted third installment in the Fated Saga. In the land of the Goblin King, magic is strictly forbidden! Nevertheless, this does not stop Colin Jacoby from using the Magicante as a smoke screen while he searches for his missing dream girl, Catrina Flummer. At the same time, his mind reading twin sister, Meghan, is mortified to learn she will be working alongside the Svoda s newest Initiate, Ivan Crane, on a quest for Juliska Blackwell. She knows their journey will be fraught with peril, but also feels confident that Ivan and Meghan will work well together, as Firemancer and Initiate to retrieve something the Goblin King has stolen. Moreover, if this stolen item is not recovered, the magical world will once again be on the verge of doom. Through extenuating circumstances, Colin, Meghan and Ivan, along with a few more unexpected guests, journey into the magical realm of the Goblins only to make a forced retreat, with the entire Goblin army following in their wake! Can they make it back in time to sound the warning? Will they be able to dethrone the Goblin King? A new magical power just might make it possible for one of the twins. But will this new power also be their undoing? Leading them down a dark path where the only outcome is death!
