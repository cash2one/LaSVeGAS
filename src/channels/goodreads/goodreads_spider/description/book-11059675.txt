His honour weighs him down at court where a true man does what he will, not what he must and a dead enemy is a thing of beauty. The old gods have no power in the south, Stark s family is split and there is treachery at court. Worse, the vengeance-mad heir of the deposed Dragon King has grown to maturity in exile in the Free Cities. He claims the Iron Throne.
