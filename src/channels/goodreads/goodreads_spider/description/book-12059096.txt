12059096:::::Deadly Dreams:::::Danielle Mason is a typical teenager. School, best friend...nightmares that reach out and touch her. She doesn t know why she has nightmares of darkness and death and she doesn t know why the green eyed boy in each one reaches out to her. Then the day comes that she realizes that the nightmares are somehow tied to her but she just doesn t understand how. Could these be scenes from previous lives and could this green eyed boy be part of her destiny? And what about the new boy at school and the familiar feeling she has around him? Could it be just a coincidence?
