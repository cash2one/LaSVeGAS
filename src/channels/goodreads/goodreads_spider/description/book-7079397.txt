7079397:::::Living In Darkness:::::Not once in her life did farm girl Renee Crocker, imagine she would encounter a world found only in the minds of myth-seeking men. Although the things they sought were not always unheard of in the 1930 s in other parts of the world, life was just too harsh in the small Texas community, to pay mind to anything other than raising a healthy crop to ensure the survival of one s family. But late one evening during supper, a stranger comes knocking on the door of the Crocker family farm house and is invited inside. It doesn t take long for Renee to discover a great number of things that people in her neck of the woods couldn t even contemplate. The dark of night takes on a whole new meaning, and the once vulnerable young country woman finds herself struggling to survive in a world that demands she live forever in darkness.
