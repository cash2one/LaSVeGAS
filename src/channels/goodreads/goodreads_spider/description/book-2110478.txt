2110478:::::Horseshoe:::::The Horse Wise Pony Club riders have been working hard on a precision horseback drill. They'll perform it on Founders' Day to raise money for the needy animals at a nearby shelter. But Lisa, Stevie, and Carole want to do even more. Then Lisa gets the bright idea to set up a tent and read people's fortunes before the drill. The Saddle Club's wildest dreams are fulfilled when nasty Veronica diAngelo enters the tent to learn whether there's romance in her cards. But someone else wants to know the future too -- what can the girls predict for a lonely junior rider?
