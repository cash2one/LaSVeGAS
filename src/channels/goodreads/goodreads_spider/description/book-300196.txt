300196:::::Sidney & Norman: A Tale of Two Pigs:::::A multi-layered tale of two very different pigs that you will find yourself snickering at . . . yet you will find very thought-provoking. Sidney &amp; Norman uses the simple context of two pigs living next door to each other to communicate a profound truth about how we judge each other and often judge ourselves. On the surface, Sidney &amp; Norman appears to be a picture book that will entertain kids. But this story has deeply moved adult audiences in informal readings, leading to deep-thinking discussions.
