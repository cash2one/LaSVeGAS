15840017:::::Uncle:::::After the death of his sister and her husband, Travis Murdock finds himself suddenly raising his six year old nephew, Jason. Parenting was something Travis never thought he would face, but he embraces it and is excited for Jason to come live with him on his ranch. Unhappy about the situation, his sister's in-laws file a claim with the courts that Travis is endangering the child and is unfit to raise a small boy. Evan Mitchell is sent to investigate the claims of endangerment, but what he finds once he arrives on the Murdock ranch is an attraction to Travis that could put the whole case in jeopardy, not to mention his job. As they prepare for the custody battle, both men try to ignore the feelings stirring inside them as their friendship grows. Relying on their faith and hopefully the courts, the two work together to make sure that Jason stays where he wants to be with Travis.
