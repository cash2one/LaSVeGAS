7226664:::::Mona Lisa Eclipsing:::::From the time she was an orphan, Mona Lisa knew she was different. As a Mixed-Blood daughter of the Mon re, she rules her domain in the Louisiana Bayou. But she s about to become the hunted as her mind begins playing tricks, and no one is who they seem. Roberto Carderas, a dangerous drug lord of mixed Mon re heritage, arrives in Cozumel to eliminate a rival. But the jaguar-shifter has encountered a much more valuable prize on the island: Mona Lisa, the first female Mon re he s ever met and one especially vulnerable in that she has lost her memory. Now, with all knowledge of her real life as stripped away as her defenses, Mona Lisa can be manipulated into believing anything. Convinced that Roberto is her kind and sensual protector, Mona Lisa thwarts all attempts at her rescue including those made by her desperate lover Dante. As Roberto s devious scheme gets underway, Dante can only hope that the touch of his warm flesh will reignite total recall in the body and mind of the woman he loves. But escape for both of them could be as forever elusive as Mona Lisa s past.
