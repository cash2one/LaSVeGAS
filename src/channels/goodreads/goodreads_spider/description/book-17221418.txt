17221418:::::Recall Abortion: Ending the Abortion Industry's Exploitation of Women:::::With Foreword by Fr. Frank Pavone. Abortion harms women. Bad products are recalled every day: the Ford Pinto, faulty tires, dangerous prescription pills, contaminated lettuce. If a product is found to pose even a modest risk to those who use it, you can bet it will soon be pulled from the market. . . . Unless that product is abortion. Every abortion kills an unborn child. But more, abortion harms women risking the health and well-being of those who all too often are conned or coerced into making this terrible choice. If it were any other product, abortion would have been removed from the market long ago. In Recall Abortion , author Janet Morana exposes the myriad ways abortion exploits women, and calls for a national recall of this deadly procedure. She documents the way abortion risks and degrades women's health. And she exposes the false promises and lies by which it is pushed and sold. Morana also investigates abortion's debilitating after-effects, and gives a voice to those women who have chosen abortion and have regretted it. These testimonies (so often silenced by the abortion industry) are a powerful and sometimes heartbreaking glimpse into the real suffering abortion causes, including deep depression and lasting physical and emotional scars. Abortion does not empower women. It is not health care. It harms women, severely. Isn't it time we Recall Abortion ?
