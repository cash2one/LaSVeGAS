2501638:::::Artful Reading:::::Kids get to enjoy the images of readers in works of art in this book. Ranging in time from Antonello Da Messina's 'St Jerome in His Study' (1475) to Jacob Lawrence's 'The Library' (1960), and ranging in style from Rossetti's 'The Day Dream' to Picasso's 'Two Girls Reading', every picture tells a story about a reader.
