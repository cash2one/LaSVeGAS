15762116:::::Franklin Academy:::::Daniel Mueller ruined the fairytale. Of course, he was also the reason Rebecca Carson felt alive for the first time in her nineteen years. It made no sense that she'd connect with a violent drug addict. Then again, nothing made sense at Franklin Academy after the storybook orientation day. Rebecca is special. They all are, and Franklin J. Stanford Academy is supposed to be their safe haven. The world's a dark place for a girl whose touch triggers an intrusive glimpse into the past and future of those around her. Franklin had promised to transform her nightmare into a fairytale. She got to be a princess for three hours. There's a room at Franklin Academy that wasn't on her tour, and that's the least disturbing secret she learns from her encounter with hated outcast Daniel Mueller. One impulsive touch destroys everything, turning enemies into victims and guardians into - she doesn't know what. She only senses she's a pawn for both sides in a game she can't begin to understand. A game that's hopelessly complicated by the inexplicable volcanic connection with the troubled junkie who embraces his damning label. The problem is, Daniel's not one. Not even close. But Rebecca sees things others don't, and now she's more than a pawn.
