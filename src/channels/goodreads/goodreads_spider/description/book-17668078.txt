17668078:::::Skin Deep:::::Oh, who was she kidding? Emma knew that going to the tattoo shop with her best friend, Allie, would result in getting badgered until she ended up with some sort of needle piercing her flesh in one way or another. What she didn t plan on was ending up face-first on the floor of the shop with a busted lip. Or doing it in front of the hottest guy she d seen since well, ever. Mortified, Emma never thought she d ever step foot back in Skin Deep again. But fate, with a little help from Emma s flighty best friend and a chance encounter with a fudge bar, steps in. Now Emma s torn between taking a chance on getting her heart broken by the enigmatic, gorgeous Lucas, and playing it safe with good ol trusty B.O.B. Lucas lets Emma know that he gets what he wants, and what he wants is her. When Emma gives in and quits pushing him away, she s surprised at how quickly the walls around her heart crumble. She s even more surprised that her unconventional, zany family just endears her even more to him. But no one knows there s someone that wants her more, and they ll stop at nothing to get her.
