10170230:::::The Diary of Road Rage: Starts Out with Many But Boils Down to You:::::When I started seeing reports of rage almost on a daily basis, not just on the streets in action, but on the news channels, loaded with report after report, acts of rage on the road, in places of business, in schools; It was then I realized that I had to engage in finding the answer to what seems to be a mad epidemic. Through this book you will hear Marcus narrate accounts of true situations that you will not only be able to relate to, but that you will be able to take a back seat and become an observer not as a back-seat-driver but from a broad point of view take "the High Road"!!
