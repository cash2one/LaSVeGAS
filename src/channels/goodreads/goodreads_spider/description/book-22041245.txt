Jules Delaney, the one girl he ever tried to love, is gone and her absence continues to ruin his life in and out of the band. Emily McDonald got the word nice when she was twelve. Nice. Nice. Nice. She is a nice woman. Because she is so nice - her husband likes to cheat, her friends like to take advantage of her, and her self-esteem is dead. Late one night, Johnny and Emily find themselves sleeping only a few feet away from one another an awkward situation that can t be rectified. Until They begin to share their experiences from childhood into adulthood. They experience unexplained events together.
