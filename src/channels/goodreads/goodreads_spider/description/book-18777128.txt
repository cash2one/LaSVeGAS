18777128:::::Finding Us:::::They wanted forever... but does forever deserve a second chance? Jag Jensen and Ellen Love were best friends their whole lives until he turned thirteen and started noticing girls his own age, but that doesn't mean he stopped watching out for eleven-year-old Ellen. By his senior year in high school, baseball had taken the front seat in his life, with a scholarship to college and a pro career looming on the horizon, when sophomore Ellen catches his attention and they strike up their friendship again. Although Ellen wants more, Jag doesn't want to drag her into what he knows would be a crazy life, but love has a way of deciding one's future, and eventually they become a couple. Ellen follows him to California as he begins his pro career, but his wild and hectic lifestyle screws everything up. Now Jag is lost, realizing he's never been without his best friend in his life. Learning to live without Ellen doesn't settle well with him, so while trying to remain at the top of his career, he also wants to get his girl back, which proves to be more difficult than he thought it'd be. Will Ellen give him another chance or does that sort of thing only happen in the sappy romance novels she always used to read? Jag hopes she's willing to try again as he puts his heart on the line for the woman he knows will always be his forever and a day. This is the second book of the True Love Trilogy. Due to language and sexual content, this book is not recommended for readers under age 17
