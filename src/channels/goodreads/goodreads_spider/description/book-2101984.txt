2101984:::::Rites of Spring:::::From witty and endearing to impossible to put down, the critics have given elite marks to Diana Peterfreund s Secret Society Girl and Under the Rose . Now, in a wildly captivating new novel, Amy Bugaboo Haskel and her fellow Rose &amp; Grave knights are trading cold, gray, hyperintellectual New Haven for an annual rite of spring (well, early March) in Florida. For Amy, a week of R&amp;R on her secret society s private island should be all fun in the sun and an escape from an on-campus feud with a rival society that s turned disturbingly personal. But along with her SPF 30 and a bikini, Amy is bringing a suitcase full of issues to remote Cavador Key. Graduation from Eli University looms, not to mention buckets of unfinished business with a former flame and most pressing of all the sudden, startling transformation of a mysterious Rose &amp; Grave patriarch from sheerly evil to utterly appealing? Just when Amy thinks Spring Break can t get any less relaxing, a wacky accident puts everyone on edge. And that s only the beginning, as Amy starts to suspect that someone has infiltrated the island. With some major Rose &amp; Grave secrets to be exposed, and the potential fallout enough to take down one of America s most loathsome figureheads, what she can t know is that the party crasher is deadly serious about making sure Bugaboo doesn t get back to Eli alive
