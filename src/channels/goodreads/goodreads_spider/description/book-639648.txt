639648:::::Indian Yell: The Heart of an American Insurgency:::::Recounting twelve significant battles, and the reverberating consequences of their outcomes, that took place in the American West between the United States and American Indians from 1854 to 1890, this book is filled with harrowing stories of sacrifice and misdeeds that are well documented in the annals of history, as well as others that are less well known. Commonly and callously referred to at the time as the ?Indian Problem, ? this issue, and how it was handled, became the defining factor in shaping how American Indians live today and reflects interestingly on how the American military currently handles conflicts with insurgents throughout the world. Eloquently written by award-winning author of Dances With Wolves, Michael Blake presents these conflicts with a perspective that goes beyond the basic facts of date, place, and outcome. Blake's insightful accounts of these battles finally answers the less pondered, more human questions about this crucial part of America's history. Blake's narrative shatters stereotypes, eloquently bringing to light the undercurrents of conflict between nations that are familiar themes to a contemporary audience. Further reading suggestions are offered at the end of each chapter.
