23743718:::::Adrift:::::Five teenagers. One boat. Who will come back alive? Matt and his best friend, John, only came out to Montauk for the summer to make a little extra cash and then head back home. A seemingly basic plan for two guys from Queens. And then Matt meets Driana. Because it s always about a girl, right? The girl leads to a party, the party leads to a boat, which leads to being adrift at sea with three rich kids who have no clue about how to navigate a boat, let alone actually survive. Matt and John are used to creating stability in unstable situations, but Matt s busy falling in love at the worst possible time, and John can rub people the wrong way when he s focused on survival. Driana is trying to keep the peace, but her friends JoJo and Stef aren t making it easy. The longer they are out there, the lower everyone s reserves of mental and emotional strength, which is a problem since the biggest mistakes can happen when people are tired and hungry and have no hope. How far will each of them go to survive? And what happens when old tensions and past ghosts rise to the surface?
