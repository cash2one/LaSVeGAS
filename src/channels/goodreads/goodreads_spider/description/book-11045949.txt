11045949:::::Bad Guys of the Book of Mormon:::::From the Publisher The Book of Mormon is full of heroes Nephi, Alma the Younger, Abinadi, Captain Moroni and we read about their lives, looking for lessons that will help us be more like them. But for every good guy in the Book of Mormon, there is a bad guy as well Laman and Lemuel, Korihor, King Noah, Amalickiah. We can learn lessons from their lives as well. Each chapter recaps the story from the scriptures, including the lessons not learned by the bad guy, and ends with a call to action by providing application ideas and questions to ponder. Written in a light, conversational style, this book for teens and young adults is filled with quotes from latter-day prophets and insightful personal experiences to illustrate some of the lifechanging spiritual lessons we can learn from the bad guys of the Book of Mormon. "I loved this book! I never thought that I'd like a gospel book, but this one was fun and actually written for young people. I read it in one sitting! I loved the humor ('Hello, Moroni. My name is Ammoron. You killed my brother. Prepare to die!') as well as the questions to ponder." Amy, age 15
