2808554:::::Thicker Than Water:::::Felix Castor is a freelance exorcist, so dealing with the dead is his stock in trade. Between his private clients and some consulting for the Met, he thinks he's seen it all. But a late-night call out to a South London housing estate proves that he still has a few surprises left. After all, it's not every day you see your own name painted in blood at a a crime scene. But that's only the beginning. The estate is in the grip of an epidemic of violence, and it doesn't take Castor's sixth sense to realise that something very wrong is happening. The Anathemata, excommunicated militant arm of the Catholic Church, is on the case, too, but it's brutal solution may only make things worse. And Castor's brother, Matthew, is pursuing a secret agenda of his own. Blood may be thicker than water, but Castor suspects he's dealing with something thicker than blood. And he needs to find it before the Anathemata. Or there'll be hell to pay... (Description from back cover of mass market paperback edition)
