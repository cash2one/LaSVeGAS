24467333:::::Broken: Round One:::::Emily's life sounded more like the punch line to a joke than an actual turn of events. ... a student nurse walks into an illegal, underground fighting club... Emily Sheppard didn't have much to live for. As a foster child, her life was anything but glamorous and her daily commute through New York's underbelly reminded her of that. Nursing was her life, her only way to help others in need. Then her pride took it from her. Jai Stone wasn't important. The train he rode around New York never let him forget that. Jai had fights to fight and a brother to save, but one random night slipped an innocent into his grasp. Now they're trapped together. A fighter and a nurse. ... and it all comes down to one truth. FIGHT OR DIE.
