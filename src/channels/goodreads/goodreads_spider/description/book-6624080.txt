6624080:::::Obedience to Authority: An Experimental View:::::THE INSPIRATION FOR THE MAJOR MOTION PICTURE THE EXPERIMENTER In the 1960s Yale University psychologist Stanley Milgram famously carried out a series of experiments that forever changed our perceptions of morality and free will. The subjects or teachers were instructed to administer electroshocks to a human learner, with the shocks becoming progressively more powerful and painful. Controversial but now strongly vindicated by the scientific community, these experiments attempted to determine to what extent people will obey orders from authority figures regardless of consequences. Milgram s experiments on obedience have made us more aware of the dangers of uncritically accepting authority, wrote Peter Singer in the New York Times Book Review . Featuring a new introduction from Dr. Philip Zimbardo, who conducted the famous Stanford Prison Experiment, Obedience to Authority is Milgram s fascinating and troubling chronicle of his classic study and a vivid and persuasive explanation of his conclusions.
