106133:::::Rule of the Bone:::::In the tradition Huckleberry Finn and The Catcher in the Rye , Russell Banks s quintessential novel of a disaffected homeless youth living on the edge of society redefines the young modern anti-hero. . . . Rule of the Bone has its own culture and language, and Bone is sure to become a beloved character for generations ( San Francisco Chronicle ). With a compelling, off-beat protagonist evocative of Holden Caulfield and Quentin Coldwater, and a narrative voice that masterfully and naturally captures the nuances of a modern vernacular, Banks s haunting and powerful novel is an indisputable and unforgettable modern classic.
