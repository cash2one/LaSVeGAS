6549230:::::Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty:::::METAL GEAR SOLID: THE BEAST IS BACK. WHOSE SIDE ARE YOU ON? In a torrential downpour, former FOXHOUND agent Solid Snake stands on the George Washington Bridge ready to launch himself onto the deck of the U.S.S. Discovery as it passes below. Inside Discovery is a new generation of Metal Gear. But in the next hour, Snake s world explodes. Two years later, a young, unproven agent code-named Raiden must penetrate the mystery of what went so insanely wrong that night. In a labyrinthine superstructure in New York Harbor known as the Big Shell, enemies, allies, secret agents, and double-dealers converge: Russian commandos, a cyber Vamp, a long-legged, leather-clad, rifle-bearing beauty named Fortune, a deformed, finely manicured bomber called Fatman, and a mysterious Mister X. Somewhere in the maze, as well, is the president himself his biometrics coded to a bomb that can take out Manhattan, his loyalties unknown. Now the rookie Raiden is fighting his way to one discovery after another, including the rebirth of Solid Snake himself and a nightmare organization with a history, a plan, and a terrifying superweapon hidden in plain sight.
