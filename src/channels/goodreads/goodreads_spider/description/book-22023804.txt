22023804:::::Logan's Story:::::The first book in a brand new series from bestselling author Sarah Robinson, Logan's Story is a glimpse into the famous rockstars past and how he achieved his fame. Before the lights, stage, and music, Logan Clay struggles to figure out who he can trust and whether or not love comes with guitar strings attached. Logan Clay has the talent, and he's put in the time. All he needs is that one big break, just one chance to prove he has what it takes to be a rockstar. But his musical dreams are further away than ever... And then she walks in to his life, offering him everything he's ever wanted - fame, fortune, and music. There's no question that he's going to take the chance, or that he wants to take her at the same time. But everything is not what it seems. Will it be too late when he realizes his one big break was actually a deal with the devil in a short skirt and neon colored hair? DISCLAIMER: This book was originally published in June 2014 with the title "Logan's Story: A Sand &amp; Clay Prequel" by Sarah Robinson. Since then it has been re-edited, a few short scenes here and there added in, and given a new title and a new cover in order to improve the novel. This is the final product of that revision process so there have been a lot of changes, but the story itself is relatively the same. This novel is meant for 18+ years old.
