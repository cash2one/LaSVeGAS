256522:::::Capture the Moment: The Pulitzer Prize Photographs:::::Collected here are the Pulitzer Prize-winning photographs (updated to include winners through 2001) pictures that influenced our thinking in times of crisis and sometimes stirred us to action. Among them are Joe Rosenthal's World War II photograph of the raising of the flag over Mount Suribachi on Iwo Jima, commemorating the more than 6,000 marines who died in the battle for that small Pacific island, and Robert Jackson's photograph of Jack Ruby killing Lee Harvey Oswald, recalling the anguish of the assassination of President John F. Kennedy. The pictures document that we have lived in a violent age, showing the brutalities of war, racism, and despotism. But the Pulitzer photojournalists also recorded tender and compassionate moments, as in Brian Lanker's pictures of joyous parents at the birth of their child, or Scott Shaw's photographs of the rescue of a little girl trapped in a well. In coming centuries, these indelible images will inevitably be used to illustrate the triumphs and tragedies of our era.
