28282323:::::Trouble in Trondheim: Bikers and Gangsters:::::Kurt Hammer is in trouble. His wife and infant have been found brutally murdered, and Hammer has to leave the past behind. At the same time, a menace is killing innocent victims in the city of Trondheim, and the police are clueless. Kurt Hammer must save the day. Trouble in Trondheim: Bikers and Gangsters is Mats Vederhus' second novel. It is set in the Norwegian city of Trondheim and the Russian Capitol of Moscow. It fits neatly into the Scandinavian tradition of Nordic Noir, and will satisfy anyone who's ever read any books in this genre, including Stieg Larsson's world-famous "Millenium"-trilogy. Mats Vederhus currently lives in Trondheim, meaning that the book offers up thrilling descriptions of various places and areas in the city. REVIEWS I really liked the plot. It is exciting and it just keeps on escalating in a way that never makes it boring and it makes the story both interesting and good. - Ida Elise stberg, bymarlida.blogspot.no/
