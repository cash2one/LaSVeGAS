23569954:::::Conspiracy:::::The members of the Ironskin Clan live in a state of constant flux. Their lives have been going from blissful and ideal to hellish and miserable since the beginning of the line. With the latest members however, Liz, Michael and Vincent, they have had more than their fair share of the bad. One member of their family has miraculously been restored to them, although a piece of him is still missing. The Angels have fallen, it's a time of great tragedy for the entire world. But that has not slowed down the plot of the Archdemons, the pagan gods or other, unforeseen enemies... not by one bit. The entire world witnessed the sky literally fall, yet the only evidence left are over a thousand craters littering the worldwide landscape. This has forced many secret societies to form to combat what they perceive as a hidden war, a threat to their ways of life. Without even knowing it, Michael, Liz, Vincent and their entire family, are now being targeted as the sole threat of a massive conspiracy. The humans are no longer finding it easy to accept "The Great Lie", the "Magnum Mendacium". With time running out, for all factions involved, who will win? Will Clan Ironskin be able to prevent any of their major enemies to triumph, all the while, maintaining the sanctity of the veil? Or is the veil already destroyed, and it's just a matter of time before the humans revolt against the elder races...? Not if nature's staunchest defender has anything to say about that...
