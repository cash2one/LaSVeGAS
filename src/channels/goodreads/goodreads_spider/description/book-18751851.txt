18751851:::::Horn OK Please: The Scrotum Scrolls:::::In the second instalment of the Horn OK Please series, the morons , Chief Redbull, Goose Goldsmith, Derek Demonia and Hound Hitchhiker, are abducted by an alien race called the Scrotum Heads, who entrust them with a mission to locate the Scrotum Scrolls ancient documents that contain the secrets to the Universe. According to the Mayan calendar, doomsday is looming, and the evil Hurricane Helga and her henchmen from Planet Afaria are heading to destroy the planet on that very day...unless the morons can find the scrolls in time. With their trusty SUV, Motormouth, they must drive across the country in search of their destiny, unlock secret codes, discover hidden keys and battle aliens. From meeting shamans and opening intergalactic wormholes, from blowing up boats to groping naked statues, from surviving in harsh, cold mountainous climates to battling dry, desert heat the morons must do it all. Quirky, fun and wildly imaginative, Horn OK Please: The Scrotum Scrolls is an indisputably hilarious read.
