12087835:::::The Story Adult Curriculum Participant's Guide: Getting to the Heart of God's Story:::::The Story small group Bible study, by Randy Frazee, provides groups of all sizes the opportunity to discuss and apply what they experienced during the 31 week The Story church campaign. To understand the Bible, says Frazee, you need bifocal lenses, because two perspectives are involved. The Lower Story, our story, is actually many stories of men and women interacting with God in the daily course of life. The Upper Story is God s story, the tale of his great, overarching purpose that puts the individual stories together like panels in one unified mural. In 31 sessions, The Story video-based small group study opens your eyes to God s master plan unfolding in the lives of the Bible s characters-and in your own life. Discover the heart of God s Upper Story, and the joy that comes as you align your story with God s. The Story Participant Guide and DVD are designed for use by groups of all sizes, including small groups and Sunday school and adult education classes, for each of the 31 weeks of The Story church-wide journey.
