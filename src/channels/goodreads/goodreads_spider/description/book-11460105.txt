11460105:::::Divine Savior:::::Shade Doe has powers. Scary powers. She really wishes she understood them but she had no memory of her past or who she is. Living in abandoned buildings and doing what she needs to survive she is also helping some poor kids as best she can. When she literally runs down a man in an alley after liberating some dinner for her and the kids she finds herself annoyed that she is unable to stop thinking about this charismatic, sexy handsome man. Colin Larimore is a powerful vampire who has been around since the late 1800 s and can t believe he cannot get one cheeky street person out of his head after she knocked him over on the street running away after probably committing some crime. When the two of them finally give into fate, sparks fly and hot passion ensues. Their love creates a commanding force that cannot be contained. When circumstances align against them, they work together to save each other and to save an entire world.
