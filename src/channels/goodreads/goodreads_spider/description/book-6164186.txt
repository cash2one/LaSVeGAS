6164186:::::Legend:::::DROS DELNOCH: A might fortress protected by six outer walls, spanning the Delnoch pass: the only route by which an army could pass through the mountains. Held by the Earls of Bronze, Dros Delnoch was the stronghold of the Drenai Empire. Now it was the last battleground - all else had fallen before the Nadir hordes. Hope was resting on the skill of one old man - Druss, the Legend.
