22130605:::::Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage:::::Bound for Antarctica, where polar explorer Ernest Shackleton planned to cross on foot the last uncharted continent, the Endurance set sail from England in August 1914. In January 1915, after battling its way for six weeks through a thousand miles of pack ice and only a day s sail short of its destination, the Endurance became locked in an island of ice. For ten months the ice-moored Endurance drifted northwest before it was finally crushed. But for Shackleton and his crew of twenty-seven men, the ordeal had barely begun. It would end only after a miraculous journey through more than 850 miles of the South Atlantic s heaviest seas to the closest outpost of civilization. In Endurance , the definitive account of Shackleton s fateful trip, Alfred Lansing brilliantly narrates the harrowing voyage that has defined heroism for the last century.
