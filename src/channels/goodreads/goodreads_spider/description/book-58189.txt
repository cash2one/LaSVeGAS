58189:::::J.D. Salinger's Franny and Zooey:::::An insightful examination into the psychology of a young woman through the seemingly mundane events of her day to day life. On one hand, Franny is an independent-minded college girl trying to distance herself from her family while questioning her purpose in the world. On the other, she's the youngest of seven children, all famous for brilliant performances on the radio quiz program "It's a Wise Child," with a brother Zooey who continually reminds her of how she "should" be. When Franny discovers she's pregnant, her conflict heightens as she looks at friends who seem to have resigned themselves to lives as housewives and compares that to the life she'd always thought she'd lead.
