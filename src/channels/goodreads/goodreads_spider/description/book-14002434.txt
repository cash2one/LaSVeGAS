14002434:::::By His Desire:::::Keith Logan has something that Sarah Harper wants, and he s going to use it to get what he wants. Her. All his life, Keith s money and good looks were enough to charm anyone except for shy, beautiful Sarah. Back in high school she was the one girl he couldn t have, and the one girl who haunted his dreams. When he sees her again for the first time in ten years, he knows he ll do anything to make her his even if it s just for one week. There s only one flaw in his plan. With a woman like Sarah, one week will never be enough. By His Desire is a steamy romance novella of 20,000 words. EXCERPT Keith shook his head. Whatever good opinion you might have about me, I m about to destroy it. Sarah stared at him. What are you talking about? How? With the offer I m about to make you. What offer? He leaned forward across the table. The museum has the portrait for one more week. When the week is up, I ll have the painting delivered to you. It will be yours. No, Keith. I told you I don t want your charity. This isn t charity. Don t you want to hear my price? She sat back in her chair and folded her arms. Fine. In exchange, for one week, you ll live with me in my house. During the day, you can do whatever you want. There s a gym, an indoor pool, a library, a home theater. There s a study where you can write, and I have a chef who ll cook you anything you want to eat. But at night... he paused for a moment. At night, you have to do whatever I want.
