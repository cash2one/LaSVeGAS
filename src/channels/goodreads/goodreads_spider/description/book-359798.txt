When Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin Skywalker are sent to the Galactic Games, they are meant to be keepers of the peace. Then they discover an illegal event that Anakin knows all too well: Podracing. Even though Obi-Wan forbids it, Anakin cannot resist the thrill of the race and the chance to face off against his childhood rival, the loathsome Sebulba. As a Jedi, Anakin is supposed to let go of his past. But his past will not let go of him.
