The water under the bridge becomes mighty choppy when beautiful Angelita walks into their lives. Jesse s ex, Kerri Ann, is a far cry from where she thought she d be in life.

They seem destined to remain just friends, until Angelita comes to town and stirs everything up. As Angelita and Jesse embark on a relationship, her father s demands become threats and she s forced back to Atlanta. Jesse s attempt to save her uncovers more of her past than he bargained for.
