8357781:::::Tales from the Uncertain Country and Other Stories:::::New to the NCL! Forty-one sparkling classics of Quebec fiction In these fantastic tall tales a bull turns into a lawyer, a lonely Alberta cow's ghost longs for Quebec, and Ulysses comes back to Ithaca Corner, Ontario. Jacques Ferron writes metaphysical fables, political satire, portraits of men and women in all walks of life, and wry comedies, with great originality and a profound sympathy for the human condition. These forty-one sparkling classics are among the most celebrated works in modern Quebec literature. They appear in this original New Canadian Library collection in a specially revised and expanded translation by Betty Bednarski.
