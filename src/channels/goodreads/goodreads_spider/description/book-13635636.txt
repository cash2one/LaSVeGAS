13635636:::::Note To Self:::::In conversation someone asked me if I was open- minded, I replied Yes, but not to the extent of listening to stupid ideas. Brian E. Niskala This is a collection of my thoughts over the years, well the ones I felt note worthy anyhow. Most are Facebook posts, others private or not so private thought moments. I find most to be humorous and witty. My wife just finds them mildly funny if at all tolerable. She reminds me often that I am not as funny as I think I am. Either way, I hope you enjoy this short collection of moments and stories. As a manager, I often dealt with less than intelligible people. Most often times these people where far from intelligent, but not necessarily stupid. I always did what I thought was right; listening with one ear and as soon as I deemed it getting stupid I stopped listening, just short of sticking fingers in my ears and going la la la la la not listening! this helped me stay more tolerable to the people around me, present company reading this excluded of course.
