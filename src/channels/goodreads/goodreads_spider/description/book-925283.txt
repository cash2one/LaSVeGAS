925283:::::Surviving With Wolves:::::This book was supposed to be an amazing true survival story of a little girl whose parents were taken to Auschwitz. She made her way through the woods of Europe during the WW2 and was later adopted by a family of wolves who took care of her. Later she found her way back home but never met her parents again. However, it has been revealed that the author Misha Defonseca (real name Monique De Wael) made up the whole story. She was not even Jewish. De Wael was brought up Catholic but kept on insisting her story was true up until it was found out to be a fabrication in March 2008.
