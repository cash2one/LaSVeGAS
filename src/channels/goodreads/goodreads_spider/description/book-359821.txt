359821:::::The Uncertain Path:::::Obi-Wan Kenobi is no longer a Jedi. He has chosen instead to be a part of the revolution on the planet Melida/Daan. His Master, Qui-Gon Jinn, has gone back to Coruscant, where trouble is stirring inside the Jedi Temple. Obi-Wan takes comfort in his friends, the other leaders of the revolution. Together they have power--perhaps too much power. As the revolution continues, friends become enemies, and Obi-Wan's path grows more and more uncertain. Qui-Gon is no longer around to help him. Obi-Wan is on his own.
