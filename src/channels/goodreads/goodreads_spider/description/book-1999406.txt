"The Wright family lives in Chico with a little herd of goats and an exploded septic tank that drowns their yard, their interiors, their whole desperate souls with sewage, and that's just one of the hurdles they face in Dustin Heron's collection of linked PARADISE STORIES. In lesser hands his excremental invention might have lapsed into adolescent gross-out, Celine or Guyotat for kids. Instead it builds on strong working class foundations into a piercing cry for justice and for spiritual vision. Heron steers his Paradiso up a beautifully tilted arc that leaves his men, women, and children still struggling, but alive with the quicklime of hope" -Dodie Bellamy.
