21841757:::::This Changes My Family and My Life Forever:::::Intrigued by multiple timelines, aliens, psi skills, romance and planetary change? Clara and the alien "Band" are back in Volume II of "The Spanners Series." The Many Worlds Collective makes its presence officially known in 2012 to Dr. Clara Ackerman Branon, their chosen first liaison, in Volume I, "This Changes Everything." We pick up her story in Volume II, "This Changes My Family and My Life Forever." As Chief Communicator, Clara leads the way for interspecies communication on- and off-planet via the "fish," which brings an end to Earth's disparate governments and nations. Fighting these changes are the Psi-Defiers, led by one of the oldest friends of the Chief of the Psi-Warriors, its reluctant leader, Rabbi Moran Ackerman, one of Clara's nephews. At the newly created psi Excellent Skills Program school on The Campus, an ever-expanding, multi-species community and training camp, Clara, Moran, Esperanza Enlaces (Espe, the Chief Media Contact), and Clara's on-again, off-again lover/friend, Epifanio Dang make their new homes."Snapshots" of Clara's life from age 9 through the Transition show how she develops to be Earth's first Chief Communicator. Stories from the younger Spanners about the first five years of The Transition fill Volume II. How would YOU do with the changes?
