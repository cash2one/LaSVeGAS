3487420:::::The Graveyard Book:::::Nobody Owens, know to his friends as Bod, is a perfectly normal boy. Well, he would be perfectly normal if he didn't live in a graveyard, being raised and educated by ghosts, with a solitary guardian who belongs to neither the world of the living nor the world of the dead. There are danger and adventures for Bod in the graveyard: The strange and terrible menace of The Sleer; a gravestone entrance to a desert that leads to the city of ghouls; friendship with a witch, and so much more. But it is in the land of the living that real danger lurks, for it is there that the man Jack lives and he has already killed Bod's family. A fascinating story of love and friendship realized in the most unlikely of place, this new novel by bestselling author Neil Gaiman, with illustrations by award-winning Chris Riddell, is set to become a classic.
