2134448:::::Pajo:::::Pajajopi Bamatojasi-or simply Pajo-is the last of a despised race of hair-covered creatures. Though only thirteen years old, he has lived alone in the Darkwood since his mentor, an elderly monk, died nearly four years ago. His life is one of isolation and self-loathing until he is unwittingly-then unwillingly-drawn into a multi-faceted plot that includes an assassination attempt on the royal prince and the beginnings of a civil war. Pajo must race to the royal city to save the Infant Prince while outrunning the crazed killer determined to stop him. Through interactions with some new companions, Pajo learns a great deal about himself and his duty to do what is right and honorable, even when it is neither convenient nor easy. Pajo also discovers that the name that was given to him may mean more than he could have possibly imagined-and may well link him to a national patriarch who lives only within the pages of a two-thousand-year-old book. A mighty tale of fantasy, magic, and adventure, "Pajo" explores the virtues of character and hope and celebrates the true meaning of heroism.
