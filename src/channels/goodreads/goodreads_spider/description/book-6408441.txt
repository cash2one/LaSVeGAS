6408441:::::Enduring:::::Forty years ago Donald Harington created the little town of Stay More, hidden away in the hills of the Ozarks. He populated it with generations of families that had escaped the Appalachians in search of more room, greener pastures, freedom from convention, sweeter air and water, or, simply, a world where time and history do not matter. In Enduring, Harington continues the themes of the Stay More series and reveals, for the first time, the mysteries of the life of Latha Bourne, the heroine and demigoddess of Lightning Bug, The Choiring of the Trees, and other Harington classics. Latha is set apart from her fellow Stay Morons, as Harington affectionately calls them, by her beauty, wit, mystery, and intense, unfullfilled sexuality.
