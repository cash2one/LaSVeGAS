12154294:::::Getting Over Garrett Delaney:::::Can a twelve-step program help Sadie kick her unrequited crush for good? Abby McDonald serves up her trademark wit and wisdom in a hilarious new novel. Seventeen-year-old Sadie is in love: epic, heartfelt, and utterly one-sided. The object of her obsession ahem, affection is her best friend, Garrett Delaney, who has been oblivious to Sadie s feelings ever since he sauntered into her life and wowed her with his passion for Proust (not to mention his deep-blue eyes). For two long, painful years, Sadie has been Garrett s constant companion, sharing his taste in everything from tragic Russian literature to art films to '80s indie rock all to no avail. But when Garrett leaves for a summer literary retreat, Sadie is sure that the absence will make his heart grow fonder until he calls to say he s fallen in love. With some other girl! A heartbroken Sadie realizes that she s finally had enough. It s time for a total Garrett detox! Aided by a barista job, an eclectic crew of new friends (including the hunky chef, Josh), and a customized self-help guide, Sadie embarks on a summer of personal reinvention full of laughter, mortifying meltdowns, and a double shot of love.
