13584313:::::The Hole of Tank Girl:::::Bringing together all the classic Hewlett and Martin Tank Girl comics for the first time in this fantastic slipcased edition with additional material including original art, unseen Hewlett pages, a "lost" Tank Girl story, and a brand new Tank Girl cover by artist Jamie Hewlett. The core Tank Girl works have been lovingly restored for this major collection, spanning the entire Jamie Hewlett era of Tank Girl . With Booga and the rest of the crew in tow, Tank Girl delights in the sort of marvellous mayhem that made us adore her the moment she stomped into our lives with her sexy boots and sassy mouth.
