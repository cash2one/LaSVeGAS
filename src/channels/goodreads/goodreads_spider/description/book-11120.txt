11120:::::Gulliver's Travels and Other Writings:::::This volume helps readers situate one of the most popular adventure novels ever written, Gulliver's Travels, within the 18th-century process of inventing and resisting Great Britain. Ideas of nationalism--both Irish and British--are questioned and explored. Gulliver's Travels is interpreted as a critique of British colonial aggression, and has special appeal for courses in British literature and Irish studies. Supplemental materials include additional writings by Swift, such as pamphlets (including the famous A Modest Proposal), sermons, poems, and letters. A wealth of critical essays adds further context.
