92084:::::Three From Galilee: The Young Man from Nazareth:::::Marjorie Holmes, the award-winning author of such classic bestsellers as I've Got to Talk to Somebody, God , was renowned for making the Bible come to life in books that brought hope and inspiration to millions. The first novel in this trilogy-her acclaimed, hugely successful Two from Galilee-told the great love story of Mary and Joseph as never before. Now, in Three from Galilee , Holmes's fictionalized retelling of the life of Jesus covers a period overlooked by the Gospels-the "lost years" between age 12, when Jesus debated the elders in the temple, to the age of 30, when he actually began his ministry. With great reverence, she dares to wonder what Jesus did during those years, if he was like other young men of his time, and whether he experienced God's greatest gift to humanity-love. Using her remarkable talents, Holmes brings Jesus, his parents, brothers, sisters, and friends to life in a story that is dramatic, deeply moving, and unforgettable.
