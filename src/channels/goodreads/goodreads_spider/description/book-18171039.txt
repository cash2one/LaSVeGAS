18171039:::::The Rocker That Loves Me:::::MATURE CONTENT! NOT FOR READERS UNDER 17! The Rocker . I was the fun loving, easy going, different girl okay, different girls every night Demon. One look into a pair of violet eyes and all of that changed. She doesn t even realize how beautiful she is and that makes me want her even more. Realizing that she is just as damaged as I am breaks my heart. Harper is a part of me, my other half. If only she would open her incredible eyes and see how I feel The Beauty I knew that I wasn t Shane Stevenson s type. Hot rockers don t go for plain girls like me. Years of my mother telling me just how unbeautiful I am has assured me of that. I have nothing to offer a guy that is so used to hot girls drooling over him. So why is he always there when I turn around? And why does it feel like little needles piercing my heart at the mere thought of him with someone else?
