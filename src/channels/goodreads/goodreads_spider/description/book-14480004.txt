14480004:::::Ligeia:::::This book contains Edgar Allen Poe's 1838 short story, "Ligeia." An anonymous narrator recounts the story of his meeting a beautiful and intellectual woman "in some large, old decaying city near the Rhine." They get married, and Ligeia introduces her husband to all manner of mathematical and metaphysical knowledge. Soon after, she becomes seriously ill and dies. The narrator's second marriage comes to a similarly tragic end, resulting in the uncanny reappearance of the mysterious Ligeia. A gripping and atmospheric tale, "Ligeia" is highly recommended for fans of fantasy and horror fiction, and would make for a fantastic addition to any collection. Edgar Allan Poe (1809-1849) was an American author, editor, poet, and critic. Most famous for his stories of mystery and horror, he was one of the first American short story writers, and is widely considered to be the inventor of the detective fiction genre. Many antiquarian books such as this are becoming increasingly rare and expensive. We are republishing "Ligeia" now in an affordable, high-quality edition complete with a specially commissioned new biography of the author.
