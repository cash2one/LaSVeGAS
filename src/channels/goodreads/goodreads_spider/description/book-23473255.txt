23473255:::::Sussex Tales:::::Jan Edwards s prize-winning Sussex Tales runs a witty and thought provoking gamut of village events and its more curious characters. From fanged ferret to bulls in lead masks; ancient hand grenades to exploding ginger beer; cricketing dogs to wassailing orchards - Sussex Tales weaves traditional country wines, recipes, folklore and Sussex dialect into these natural tales of living a farming childhood in the vanished world of 1950s and 60s rural life. Winner of the Winchester Conference Short Volume prize.
