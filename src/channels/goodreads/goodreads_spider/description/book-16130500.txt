16130500:::::Exposed:::::Every picture tells a story. But not all of them have happy endings. As a forensic photographer at the Delphi Center crime lab, Maddie Callahan is used to seeing violence up close, but she's never before been the target of it. When a freelance photo shoot goes awry, she realizes she may have seen, and perhaps photographed, the kidnapping of a key witness in a federal probe. And although her camera was stolen, Maddie knows she has something that could be even more valuable to investigators. FBI agent Brian Beckman has spent months investigating a vicious criminal known as the Doctor, only to have a key witness abducted on his watch. Worse, he's falling for the woman who may be the Doctor's next target. Maddie's aloof facade hides a world of hurt that he wants to heal, no matter how much she keeps him at bay. But first he has to protect her from the danger that's just out of focus, drawing close enough to shoot . . . and kill.
