The President of Gadley University seeks her expertise when Japanese Ukiyo-e woodcut prints appear to be missing from the university's art collection, and Anna Lee soon discovers there is more to the problem than just missing woodcut prints. Complicated by a murder and suspicious behavior in the university art gallery, Anna Lee and the insurance company investigator, Gerard Pickens, are embroiled in crime that extends beyond the university campus. THE ART SLEUTH, cleverly plotted and filled with twists and turns, is filled with fascinating characters and local color true to small Southern towns.
