20763448:::::WarriorCats - Zeichen der Sterne #1 - Der vierte Schuler:::::After the sharp-eyed jay and the roaring lion, peace will come. . . . Four warrior Clans have shared the land around the lake as equals for many moons. But a prophecy foretells that three ThunderClan cats will hold the power of the stars in their paws. Jayfeather and Lionblaze know that they are two of the cats in the prophecy. Now the brothers must wait for a sign from StarClan to dis cover the identity of the third cat. Meanwhile, Dovekit and Ivykit -- kin of the great leader Firestar -- are poised to become ThunderClan apprentices. Soon one sister will have an ominous dream -- and will begin to realize that she possesses mystical skills unmatched by any other cat. In the midst of a cruel season that threatens the lives of all four warrior Clans, bonds will be forged, promises made, and three young cats will start to unravel the secrets that bind them together.
