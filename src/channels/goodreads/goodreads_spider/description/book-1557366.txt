1557366:::::Good-Bye, Mrs. Otis:::::In the words of 7-year-old Elizabeth Wakefield... Mrs. Otis is leaving our school. Forever. We're having a party to say good-bye. But Mr. Bunny (our class pet) is lost! Mrs. Otis gave him to us. So how can we have a party without Mr. Bunny? My friend Winston has a great idea. He's going to put rabbit ears on his cat Friskie--and bring him to our room in disguise! I hope nobunny gets in trouble. And I hope we find the real Mr. Bunny fast.
