9491739:::::Clean:::::You re probably wondering how I ended up here. I m still wondering the same thing. Olivia, Kelly, Christopher, Jason, and Eva have one thing in common: They re addicts. Addicts who have hit rock bottom and been stuck together in rehab to face their problems, face sobriety, and face themselves. None of them wants to be there. None of them wants to confront the truths about their pasts. And they certainly don t want to share their darkest secrets and most desperate fears with a room of strangers. But they ll all have to deal with themselves and one another if they want to learn how to live. Because when you get that high, there s nowhere to go but down, down, down.
