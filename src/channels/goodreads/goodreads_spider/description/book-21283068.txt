21283068:::::Bottle:::::In Nails Kevin was a prisoner of frustration, middling, but waiting for who knows what. In Bottle he's liberated with the proverbial "kick up the arse" he needs. This book has got everything. Even the kitchen sink! It's teeming with life and death, tears and laughter, sex and violence, parents and children, brutality and tenderness, anger and contentment... But why should I go on? Look up further antonyms yourself. Or save yourself the trouble and simply read the book. Although Bottle is the sequel to Nails it can be read in its own right.
