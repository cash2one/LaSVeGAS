331688:::::CivilWarLand in Bad Decline:::::An alternate cover edition exists here . From the New York Times bestselling author of Tenth of December , a 2013 National Book Award Finalist for Fiction. A New York Times Notable Book "This book is a rare event: a brilliant new satirist bursting out of the gate in full stride, wildly funny, pure, generous all that a great humorist should be." Garrison Keillor"An astoundingly tuned voice graceful, dark, authentic, and funny telling just the kinds of stories we need to get us through these times." Thomas Pynchon "Scary, hilarious, and unforgettable . . . George Saunders is a writer of arresting brilliance and originality." Tobias Wolff "A cool satirist and a wicked stylist. The quirkiest and most accomplished short-story debut since Barry Hannah's Airships ." Jay McInerney, The New York Times Book Review "Ingenious . . . full of savage humor and originality [and] scorching brilliance . . . the author creates a nightmarish post-apocalyptic world that might have been envisioned by Walt Disney on acid." The Philadelphia Inquirer "The debut of an exciting new voice in fiction. Mr. Saunders writes like the illegitimate offspring of [Nathaniel] West and Kurt Vonnegut, perhaps a distant relative of Mark Leyner and Steven Wright. He's a savage satirist with a sentimental streak who delineates, in these pages, the dark underbelly of the American dream: the losses, delusions, and terrors suffered by the lonely, the disenfranchised, the downtrodden and the plain unlucky. . . . Bizarre events pop up regularly in CivilWarLand like road signs on a highway, directing the reader toward the dark heart of Mr. Saunders's America. What powers the stories along is Mr. Saunders's wonderfully demented language, his ear for absurdity and slang, his own patented blend of psychobabble, techno-talk and existential angst. Mr. Saunders's satiric vision of America is dark and demented; it is also ferocious and very funny." The New York Times
