287571:::::Bubbles In Trouble:::::New troubles for Bubbles: Her friend, bride-to-be Janice, never showed up at the altar, and everybody's blaming Bubbles for singing Lynyrd Skynyrd's "Free Bird" at the bachelorette party the night before. Now Bubbles has just found Janice's uncle Elwood dead on his bathroom floor-his skull bashed in and his Rolls Royce missing. The baffling murder could be her Big Break as Bubbles goes deep undercover in Whoopee, Pennsylvania (located between Intercourse and Paradise) as a "plain girl from Ohio" boarding with a local Amish family. That means no spandex, no showers, and...no makeup. When she's not helping out on the farm, Bubbles searches for clues-with the usual hilarious results.
