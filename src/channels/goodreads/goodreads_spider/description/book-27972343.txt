27972343:::::Symbol of Treason:::::I am a ghost. Nothing more than the emptiness of a shadow. But when it comes to murder, my body says differently, as I carry the scars from a life best forgotten. I wear many faces, a technique derived from being born prey. Many of us are victims of circumstance, our shackles wound tight from birth. My fellow victims of injustice will see all that is already so devastatingly familiar. For those more fortunate, you may wonder if such horrors exist at all. My very existence is forbidden and everyone I loved is dead. Yet I cling to this life which has brought me little more than the sharp point of a blade. I never made plans for growing old. I couldn t afford to set myself up for such hopes, and I thought I was content with that burden until I met him. But everything comes at a price. And as I weave through this maze of thorns in hopes of reaching salvation, I fall down, bleed and dare to try again. For this man is more than an ache I cannot sooth, and whether I can admit it or not, he s changed me; and the masks I so carefully wear, will no longer be enough. Authors Note: This story deals with heavy subject matter such as rape, murder, and slavery, and requires the reader to accept the fact that despite this fictional set, real life is fare graver than the words written on these pages. The relationships of these characters are built on sacrifice, forgiveness, and vulnerability to the very core. This is not a work of erotica, but it is also not intended for an audience under the age of 18. This is the first book in a Duet series with a semi-cliffhanger. Please be advised. For your interest I am deeply grateful. Wishing you a meaningful journey of discovery and an abundance of joy.
