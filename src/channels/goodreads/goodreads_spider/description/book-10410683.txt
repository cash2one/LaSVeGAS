10410683:::::Taken:::::Welcome to the fictitious little town of Watery, Pennsylvania where the district attorney s personal secretary, Mary Murray never planned to become a single mom or a suspect in her infant s disappearance, but she plans to find Jena before she suffers the same fate Mary s younger brother had when he was taken twelve years earlier. AND From a beta reader-I must tell you that everything I've read lately has bored me to tears...until today. Honestly, I could not put TAKEN down. I was pleasantly surprised. I felt the author captured each character's personality and conveyed them to the reader with such clarity, that they felt like real people. I was thrilled with how the book ended---Lucilla From The Author Years ago a small child was taken from his home not far from where I live. The child was never found. His disappearance haunted me over the years, and still does. Hopefully someday I will know what happened to that little boy. It breaks my heart every time I hear a news report about a missing child. So I suppose the disappearance of that little boy long ago and those heart breaking news stories is what drove me to write TAKEN.
