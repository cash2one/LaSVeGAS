Between some heavenly interference and the love of a few good women, the Trinity just might make it home before all Hell breaks loose. The new series begins with Dylan and Vanek. Thanks to her family s curse, Dylan has been promised to a sadistic soul broker demon and she s desperate to escape a terrifying future. After an impulsive act leads her to Morningstar Sanitarium, she s inexplicably drawn to the sad and mysterious Vanek, but the connection is broken when they escape. Forced into hiding, Dylan turns to Expat Security for protection. Stunned to find the disturbingly sexy Vanek working there, she almost walks away. Another demon is the last thing she needs in her life. Formerly one of Hell s most renowned Painkillers, Vanek is horrified with being human until he discovers he s been thrown into the body of a badass mercenary with a definite kinky streak and a box of sex toys. Wondering how he got so lucky, he jumps into his new role as second in command in Trinity s ops center--Expat Security. When Dylan comes to them for help, he knows he's got to handle her case personally. As his attraction to her grows, so does the conspiracy that landed him in Brooklyn. Is Vanek s past the key to saving his future--and hers? Warning: This story contains snort out loud humor, intensely hot sex, a blistering antihero, and a damsel with a steel backbone. The author takes no responsibility for missed work or grouchiness from lack of sleep.
