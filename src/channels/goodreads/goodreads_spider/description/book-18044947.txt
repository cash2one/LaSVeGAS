18044947:::::Blue Moon Rising:::::Maiwenn Cadic doesn t have a quiet and normal life. This week won t be any different. Being the Patroness of Paris and protecting its inhabitants is a full time job but unfortunately it doesn t pay the bills and so Maiwenn tries her best to make a living as a down-on-her luck private eye for odd cases. When five shapeshifters end up dead, she knows it s bad news and has to call in The Council. They immediately send their assassin Kylian The Killer Tremaine, a typical shapeshifter who doesn t take no for an answer and seems to see everything female as a damsel in distress - which Maiwenn is really not. Together they will not only have to overcome their prejudices and obstacles in the form of a trigger-happy bounty hunter and a hungry rogue, but they will also have to trust each other in order to solve the murder before more bodies pile up. 17+, some content may not be suitable for younger readers
