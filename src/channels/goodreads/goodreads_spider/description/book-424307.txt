424307:::::Divine Governance of the Human Kingdom: Including What the Seeker Needs and The One Alone:::::A powerful but little known work, this volume contains three mystical texts. 'Al-tadbirat,' the largest, is a fascinating treatise on the divine design and management of the world, and the central role the human model plays in the creative and governing process. The other two are 'kitab kunh ma la budda minhu lil-murid' (or, "What the Seeker Needs"), a brief guide for those want to follow the Sufi path, and 'kitab al-ahadiyyah' (or, "The One Alone"), an esoteric essay on transcendental unity.
