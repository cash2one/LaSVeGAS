22850084:::::With the Father:::::I had a choice, and I chose wrong. I thought I lost everything. But when the smoke finally cleared, I discovered that I wasn t alone. Father Sullivan was a force a living and breathing force, a forbidden desire I couldn t resist. I didn t want to resist. But I wasn t the only one who wanted him, and by all accounts neither of us should have him. I had decisions to make, secrets to uncover. Both would tear my heart, my life, and what was left of my family apart. I wasn t going to take any chances this time around. If I d learned one thing during my life, it s that death is the only certainty. It s a matter of when, not if. For every action, there is a reaction. For every choice, a consequence. If I hadn t chosen to live again, I would have never known what life could be like With the Father
