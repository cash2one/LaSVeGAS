23822521:::::Lies Unspoken:::::I tried hard not to fall for the bad guy. My new roommate, Blake, is a jerk an unemployed artist with a chip on his shoulder. I can t stand him unless his hands are on me. He makes me desperate for him, and everything he makes me feel. And then there s my new boss, Pierce--successful, charming, and extremely good-looking. He goes after what he wants, but what does he see in me? I try to stay away, but I end up in the arms of exactly who I was hiding from. And when I find out what s being hidden from me, my heart twists in ways it never should. I thought I knew him. I didn't. The way he kissed me. The way his hands traveled every inch of my skin. I thought it meant something, but as it turns out, it was all lies unspoken.
