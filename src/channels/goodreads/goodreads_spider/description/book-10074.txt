10074:::::His Dark Materials Trilogy: The Golden Compass / The Subtle Knife / The Amber Spyglass:::::In an epic trilogy, Philip Pullman unlocks the door to a world parallel to our own, but with a mysterious slant all its own. D mons and winged creatures live side by side with humans, and a mysterious entity called Dust just might have the power to unite the universes--if it isn't destroyed first. Here, the three paperback titles in Pullman's heroic fantasy series are united in one dazzling boxed set. Join Lyra, Pantalaimon, Will, and the rest as they embark on the most breathtaking, heartbreaking adventures of their lives. The fate of the universe is in their hands. The Golden Compass , The Subtle Knife , and The Amber Spyglass pit good against evil in a way no reader will ever forget. (Ages 13 and older) --Emilie Coulter
