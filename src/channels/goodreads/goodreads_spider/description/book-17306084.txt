17306084:::::The Alpha's Choice:::::Katarina Bennett stopped believing in fairytales a long time ago. Prince Charming doesn't exist. Careful planning is what makes dreams come true and that's what she's spent her adult life doing. Now those plans have fallen apart. She's lost everything; her fianc , her job and her home. Determined to make a new start, Kat takes a job as a governess and teacher for five orphaned children and finds herself in an old Gothic mansion in the middle of nowhere with people who aren't what they seem. Charles Goodman is the Alpha of his wolver pack, the modern descendants of an ancient line of man/beasts who've hidden among the human race for centuries. Charles has his hands full with taking his pack in a new direction and dealing with dissention in the ranks and doubts about his own abilities to lead, but when he meets his feisty new employee, he begins to believe in a future he didn't think possible. Together, Charles and Kat, Alpha and Mate, set out to prove all things are possible and fairytales do come true.
