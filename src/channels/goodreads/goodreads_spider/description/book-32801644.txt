32801644:::::The Ground Beneath Our Feet:::::TAKE THE LEAP She s got her feet planted on the ground. He ll teach her to fly. Jessica, a curvy, driven, neat freak lawyer, is ecstatic when she finally gets her dream job even though it's taking her away from her hometown. When she meets over-the-top, man-mountain Mikey, a fitness buff and veterinarian with a messy life in all senses of the word, she thinks she just walked into the second-most exciting adventure of her life. His larger-than-life personality fascinates her, but also shakes the foundations of her quiet, introverted self, knocking her off-kilter. It s a bad idea to let him take her on as a weight-loss client. It s an even worse idea to get involved with him since he s her manwhore roommate...and she s seen him in action. If they give into their undeniable attraction, is it just a train wreck waiting to happen? Or will their desire fuel a chance at real love? If you love steamy romance, be sure to check out the fourth standalone in the Giving You series.
