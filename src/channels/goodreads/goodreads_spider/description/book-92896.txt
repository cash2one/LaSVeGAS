92896:::::The Doom Brigade:::::War can get a fellow killed. The fearless draconians of the War of the Lance have retired from the field of battle to a pleasant valley in the Kharolis Mountains. Well, it would be pleasant, if it weren't for some dwarves, whose irritating feuding prevents the draconians from realizing their greatest hope -- the ability to continue their doomed race. When the dwarves discover a map leading to a fortune buried in the dwarven kingdom of Thorbardin, the draconians are swept up in a feverish race for treasure. Little do both sides realize that they are part of the strange and terrible destiny descending upon Krynn during the Summer of Flame. A destiny that includes the children of Chaos ... the fire dragons! The Doom Brigade is the first installment in The Chaos War series, stories set during the war of the Dragons of Summer Flame , the "New York Times" best-selling novel co-authored by Margaret Weis.
