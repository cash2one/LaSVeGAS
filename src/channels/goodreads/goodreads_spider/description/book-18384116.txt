18384116:::::City of the Guardians:::::Do you ever wonder about those little nudges and whispers you get from time to time, those "Don't go there today" or "Change lanes"? City of the Guardians: Introducing Alex Honor will show you who is behind those whispers and nudges. This book will make you take notice to the existence of things beyond our sight. The characters, Stilo who represents Strength and Rip who represents Rage, will fight to make their voice the one you listen to. Which will you choose? It is the author's hope to make you think twice about the decisions you make after reading this book. Her wish is to cause you to pause and listen to the whisper that wants the best, not the worst. You might be embarrassed to admit that you have experienced a nudge or quiet whisper but you and I both know that you have. "From the beginning of the preface my interest was piqued! We all have heard these whispers, and to be able to delve into their possibilities is exciting in itself!" - Tiffany Green-Hunter "I like to think we have guardians who watch over us, but then why do bad things happen? I look forward to interacting with your characters - on both sides of the coin - and joining them on their adventures." - Steve Clarke Bee L. Kirk is a thirty five year-old, married, mother of two.
