When an elite BeiTech strike team invades the station, Hanna and Nik are thrown together to defend their home. But alien predators are picking off the station crew one by one, and a malfunction in the station s wormhole means the space-time continuum might be ripped in two before dinner. Soon, Hanna and Nik aren t just fighting for their own survival; the fate of everyone on the Hypatia and possibly the known universe is in their hands. But relax. They ve totally got this. They hope. Told through a compelling dossier of emails, IMs, classified files, transcripts and schematics, Gemina raises the stakes of the Illuminae Files, hurling readers into an enthralling new story that will leave them breathless.
