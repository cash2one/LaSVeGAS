24265751:::::Deadly Alchemy:::::How do you choose who lives and who dies? Alchemist Amelia Rimos has just discovered the cure for the Undead. Being na ve and vulnerable, she does not realize the Undead have their targets set on her. Happening upon a tall, dark, exotic man named Michel Gauthier, he saves her from becoming a victim, thrusting her into a game of cat and mouse. Amelia realizes being an Alchemist is not in her best interest when she befriends him. Is Michel as sincere as he seems or does he have an ulterior motive? When her life cannot be more complicated, John Hawthorne interjects himself into Amelia's life and shifts it completely upside down. He informs Amelia she has the key to their survival. Soon, she will realize the Undead are not the only monsters in the world Amelia will find herself in a stalemate: She will be forced to choose between destroying her evidence and saving the man she s grown to love or destroying over half the population of the world, including the love of her life with it.
