8767940:::::Regarding Ducks and Universes:::::On a foggy Monday in 1986, the universe suddenly, without warning, bifurcated. Fast forward to thirty-five years later: Felix Sayers is a culinary writer living in San Francisco of Universe A who spends his days lunching at Coconut Caf and dreaming of penning an Agatha Christie-style mystery. But everything changes when his Aunt Henrietta dies, leaving Felix a photograph of his father and himself dated ten days before Felix was born. It can only mean one thing: Felix has an alter in Universe B. Panicked that his mystery novel may have been written already, Felix crosses to San Francisco B and proceeds to flagrantly violate the rules of both worlds by snooping around his alter s life. But when he narrowly escapes a hit-and-run, it becomes clear that someone knows he s crossed over and whoever it is isn t happy about it. Now Felix must uncover the truth about his alter, the events of one Monday, and a wayward rubber duck before his time in both worlds runs out. "Weaving together physics, philosophy, and wry humor, Maslakovic's inventive debut is a delight." - Booklist "The story unfolds at a sprightly pace...clever combination of mystery, science fiction and humor gives this title broad appeal." - School Library Journal "A witty and light what if novel stuffed with an amusing and eclectic cast of characters. - Publishers Weekly "Highly recommended." - Midwest Book Review
