680178:::::The Making of Economic Policy: A Transaction-Cost Politics Perspective:::::"This work is a tour de force of the kind we have come to expect from Avinash Dixit.

The work is sure to be a standard reference in the burgeoning field of political economy." -- Anne O. Krueger, Professor of Economics, Stanford University.

The same is true for many other dimensions of economic policy.
