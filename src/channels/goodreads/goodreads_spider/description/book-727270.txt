727270:::::Marika:::::Marika has a Jewish heritage but she's a practicing Catholic. Although her father says religion is unimportant, he advises her not to act "so Jewish." It's not a good time to be Jewish in Budapest. Marika has heard bits and pieces about the war, and knows about bad things happening to Jews in other countries. But she's convinced that those horrible acts cannot happen near her home. She's more concerned about surviving her parents' separation.By the time Marika is 11 years old, she has helped her father and uncle forge identity papers that will "prove" they are not a Jewish family. When Hungary is eventually occupied by the Nazis, Marika and her mother are taken away to a school where all Jewish people are gathered. Marika's father bribes a man to buy her freedom but not her mother's. Marika escapes, having forgotten to warn her mother not to volunteer for the work camps. The Jewish Holocaust in Budapest is characterized by its late and swift occurrence. Marika's story reflects these tragic events.
