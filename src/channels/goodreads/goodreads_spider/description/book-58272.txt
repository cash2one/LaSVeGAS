58272:::::The Hundred Tales of Wisdom:::::Life, teachings and miracles of Julaludin Rumi from Aflaki's Munaqib, together with certain important stories from Rumi's works, traditionally known as The Hundred tales of wisdom' - The tales, anecdotes and narratives in this collection are used in Sufi schools for the development of insights beyond ordinary perceptions. Although the number 100 is used in the title, in Idries Shah s presentation there are 159 tales beginning with a brief description of Rumi s childhood and youth. The author Doris Lessing wrote in Books and Bookmen: The Hundred Tales is traditional hagiography, a classic studied for seven hundred years by students of the Sufi Way as part of the curriculum and that means Christians and Jews as well as Muslims. It concerns Rumi, the saint whose funeral was attended by members of these and other faiths, all saying he was their teacher. What has been needed is a simple and clear version ... and here it is. An important theme of Rumi's work is the danger of mistaking the "container for the content." He regarded even his own poetry as a "container" for the real purpose of his work. "The Hundred Tales of Wisdom" is a collection of events and "action teachings" from Rumi's life, with stories, fables and verse from his work. This classic is part of the series of basic writings now being issued by Octagon Press.
