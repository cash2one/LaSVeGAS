1383999:::::The Power of the Dog:::::Drug lord Miguel Angel Barrera is head of the Mexican drug federaci n , responsible for millions of dollars worth of cocaine traffic into the US and the torture of those who stand in its way. His nephew, Adan Barrera, is his worthy successor. Art Keller is a US government operative, so determined to obtain revenge for a murdered colleague that his pursuit of the cartel veers dangerously towards an obsession outside the law. This is a world characterised by its brutality, yet all Winslow's incredibly varied cast - including a high class prostitute, an Irish hitman and a charismatic Catholic priest - are all in their own ways searching for salvation. Don Winslow's masterpiece is not only a page-turning thriller but also a rich and compelling novel in the league of an Ellroy or Delillo.
