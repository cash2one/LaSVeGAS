13514519:::::Marathon Baba:::::"My marathon starts from the finish line," said Marathon Baba. He runs through his country for seven long years until he miraculously turns red and builds Marathon Ashram. Hundreds of runaways descend on the Ashram and become its residents. 'It's not about the pace, it's about the peace,' said Marathon Baba. Thirty-three Deadly Disciples find their peace in the freedom of the Ashram and devote themselves to their Red Guru. "For the Ashram to live, Marathon Baba must die," say the Deadly Disciples. He was warned. Running is injurious to health. Witty, wacky and weedy, Marathon Baba is a wondrous tale about the cult of a man who couldn't stop running.
