8583108:::::Suland:::::Experience the olden beauty of America, the sweeping prairies, the forested landscapes, the rivers, hills, and moors of Minnesota in "Suland." The Dakota lived off the land of lakes long before white men discovered its useful rivers and picturesque panoramas. This is the world White Fox is born into, a world of ancient traditions, shaman, spirit protectors, and communion with Mother Earth. But treaties are made, white men encroach, and the ancient traditions slowly slip away from the Dakota's minds. When White Fox experiences his first spirit walk and learns of the rocky future ahead of his tribe, it is time for decisions to be made. Will he stand and fight for his country, or is all hope lost for preserving his beloved "Suland"?
