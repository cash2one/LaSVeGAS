25530340:::::Friction:::::At the powerhouse law firm of Knight &amp; Payne, winning comes first and ethics a distant second. Leary Michaels uses her female charms to daze opponents, and it s always worked well until now. On her most personal case yet, she finds herself going up against a defense attorney just as skilled, shameless, and seductive as she is. Reeve Holloway has never met a woman as sure of her own sexuality, or as ruthless in wielding it, as Leary is. But he won t be toyed with. What Leary starts, he ll finish in the courtroom, the bedroom, or any-damn-place he wants. The sex is uninhibited, electrifying, and absolutely against the rules. Reeve s job is to ruin Leary s case even if it destroys her in the process and costs him the woman he s come to love.
