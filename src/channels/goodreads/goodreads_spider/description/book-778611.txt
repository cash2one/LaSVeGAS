778611:::::Poems and Prose of Mihai Eminescu:::::Published to mark the commemoration of the 150th anniversary of the birth of Romania's national poet, this edition of the works of Mihai Eminescu contains a selection of the best English-language renditions of poems and prose by this remarkable cultural figure of nineteenth-century Romania. Eminescu (1850-1889) was a complex personality; at once a philosopher, politician, journalist, and prose writer, but above all a poet -- he is 'an expression of the Romanian soul'. The selection in this volume includes English language versions of some of Eminescu's best-known poems and is illustrated with original drawings by the Romanian artist A Bordenache and graphics from the princeps edition of Eminescu's poems published in 1883.
