22583454:::::Kink:::::Emily Malone snuck into my life, slipped under my skin, and right into my heart. Little did I know that danger and death tagged along with her, following in her innocent wake. I m always in control but not with her. Emily makes me doubt myself because she s so important to me. Em knows nothing of the lifestyle. I know she s submissive, but I must take it slow. Gradually, step-by-step, I ll teach her to enjoy my particular brand of kink, my unique darker needs. She ll learn to love what I love. What I need. That is if both of us live long enough to complete her training "Kink is one of these books that grips you by the throat and takes you on a roller coaster ride of emotions. Heart pounding scenes and an amazing story of a woman and her journey into a BDSM lifestyle." - Kristy, Book Addict Mumma "Kink is a visceral and yet tender love story that could only be written by the sensual pen of Nikki Sex. Darkly intoxicating and wickedly irresistible " Autumn, Agents of Romance "A sexy love story written mainly from the Dom's point of view. Really fascinating and steamy HOT!" - I Love My Ereader
