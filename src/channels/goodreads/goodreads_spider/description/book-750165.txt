750165:::::For Men of Understanding:::::It is stated as follows in the 164th verse of Surah al-Baqarah that one of the purposes of the Qur'an's revelation is to think, "In the creation of the heavens and earth, and the alternation of the night and day, and the ships which sail the seas to people's benefit, and the water which Allah sends down from the sky - by which He brings the Earth to life when it was dead and scatters about in it creature of every kind-- And varying directions of the winds, and the clouds subservient between heaven and earth, there are signs for people who use there intellect". Hundreds of similar verses in the Qur'an summon people to think on those being that created. When a person examines his own body or any other living thing in nature, in it he sees design, art, plan, and intelligence. This book is written to indicate some of the numerous signs of Allah.
