207864:::::The Question Concerning Technology and Other Essays:::::To read Heidegger is to set out on an adventure. The essays in this volume are intriguing, challenging, &amp; often baffling to the reader, calling him to abandon all superficial scanning &amp; to enter wholeheartedly into the serious pursuit of thinking. Heidegger is not a 'primitive' or a 'romantic.' He is not one who seeks escape from the burdens &amp; responsibilities of contemporary life into serenity, either through the re-creating of some idyllic past or through the exalting of some simple experience. Finally, Heidegger is not a foe of technology &amp; science. He neither disdains nor rejects them as though they were only destructive of human life. The roots of Heidegger's thinking lie deep in the Western philosophical tradition. Yet that thinking is unique in many of its aspects, in its language, &amp; in its literary expression. In the development of this thought Heidegger has been taught chiefly by the Greeks, by German idealism, by phenomenology, &amp; by the scholastic theological tradition. In him these &amp; other elements have been fused by his genius of sensitivity * intellect into a very individual philosophical expression."--William Lovitt's Introduction
