12758871:::::Kiss of Pride:::::SOME MEN ARE TOO BAD TO BE TRUE... Is he really a Viking with a vampire s bite? An angel with the body of a thunder god? A lone wolf with love on his mind? Alexandra Kelly, his prey, thinks Vikar Sigurdsson is either flat-out crazy or he s trying to maneuver her into his bed--which is hardly where a professional reporter should conduct an interview, tempting as that prospect might be. SOME MEN ARE TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE... Until Vikar does something a teensy bit unexpected, and Alex begins to wonder whether her mystery man could really be everything he says he is: a Viking Vampire Angel on a thousand-year-long mission with his pack of sinful brothers and a man who s finally found the woman of his dreams. By then, Vikar is already wrapping his chiseled arms around Alex s body...and sinking his wicked fangs right into her neck. If this is sin, why does it feel so good?
