23372717:::::Sensitivity & Strength:::::Have you ever made promises that you came to regret? Sara and Ben made a pact that nothing would change between them when they started high school. But that was before they knew what high school is really about and before they realized that maybe there was more to being a couple than longtime friendship. Being a teenager is hard enough with all the hormonal changes going on, but dealing with bullies, pressure, and stress makes it way worse. And let s not forget about forbidden feelings for friends or crushes on people so out of your league that it s depressing. Sensitivity &amp; Strength is a book for every teenager (and adult who remembers what it was like.)
