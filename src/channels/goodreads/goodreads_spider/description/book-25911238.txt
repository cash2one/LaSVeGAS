25911238:::::You're the One that I Want:::::Owen Christiansen has been in a downward spiral since an injury ended his NHL career. But a job on an Alaskan crabbing boat offers a fresh start . . . maybe even a shot at romance with Elise Scotty McFlynn, the captain s daughter. Used to being one of the guys, to never relying on anyone, Scotty doesn t believe in happily ever after especially with someone like Owen. Her instinct is confirmed when Casper Christiansen arrives to drag his prodigal brother home, bringing with him a truckload of family drama and even worse, the news that Casper is wanted for questioning in connection to a crime back in Minnesota. But Owen is more than the sum of his mistakes, a truth both he and Scotty discover when she escorts both brothers to Deep Haven as part of her new job on the Anchorage police force. Thrust into an unfamiliar world of family, faith, and fresh starts, Scotty begins to see potential for a happy ending . . . if she s brave enough to embrace it.
