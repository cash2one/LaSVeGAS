236974:::::Believing God:::::Is it working? Your belief system, that is. Is it really working? God s intention all along has been for the believer s life to work.

In a recent sermon my son-in-law preached, Curt told us the only way we were going to impact the world and the next generation is to prove that our faith in Christ is real and that it works. For countless Christians I m convinced it s real. My concern is whether or not we have the fruit to suggest it works. Beth Moore; Believing God
