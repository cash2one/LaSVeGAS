1028853:::::The Carnivorous Lamb:::::The latest in the Little Sister s Classics series resurrecting gay and lesbian literary gems: a viciously funny, shocking yet ultimately moving 1975 novel, an allegory of Franco s Spain, about a young gay man (the self-described carnivorous lamb ) coming of age with a mother who despises him, a father who ignores him, and a brother who loves him. Author Agustin Gomez-Arcos left his native Spain for France in the 1960s to escape its censorship policies. The Carnivorous Lamb , originally written in French, won the Prix Hermes, and this, its 1984 English translation, was widely acclaimed.
