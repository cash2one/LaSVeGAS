226486:::::Clans of the Alphane Moon:::::"Shell Game" was originally published in 1954 for the first time. Later it was expanded into the "Clans of the Alphane Moon." (1964) When CIA agent Chuck Rittersdorf and his psychiatrist wife, Mary, file for divorce, they have no idea that in a few weeks they will be shooting it out on Alpha III M2, the distant moon ruled by various psychotics liberated from a mental ward. Nor do they suspect that Chuck's new employer, the famous TV comedian Bunny Hentman, will also be there aiming his own laser gun. How things came to such a darkly hilarious pass is the subject of Clans of the Alphane Moon , an astutely shrewd and acerbic tale that blurs all conventional distinctions between sanity and madness.
