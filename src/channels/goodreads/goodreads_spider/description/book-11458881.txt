11458881:::::Something About Witches:::::It's amazing what a little magic can do... Ruby Night Divine is a gun shop owner. She's also a witch who knows magic can fail. She's experienced it first hand, with full-blown tragic consequences. Smith &amp; Wesson is a whole hell of a lot more reliable, and nothing's as cathartic as the ability to put a few holes in the things that piss you off. Like Derek Stormwind. A powerful sorcerer, Derek is determined to get to the bottom of why Ruby pushed him away and ran three years before. He also needs her help. A coven needs training to fight a demon and his minions. While Ruby is willing to do it, she's sure it's just a ruse to get back in her heart and her bed. The thing is, that's where she wants him. Unfortunately, her bed's already made, she's this close to losing her soul, and she fears nothing can save her. Not Derek. Not even Smith &amp; Wesson.
