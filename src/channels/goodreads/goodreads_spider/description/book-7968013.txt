7968013:::::The Buddha Is Still Teaching: Contemporary Buddhist Wisdom:::::When the Buddha set in motion the wheel of Dharma, he knew that the teaching he gave was inexhaustible that every future generation would find its own skillful ways to convey it to the hearts and minds of those ready to hear. The Buddha Is Still Teaching is testimony to the fulfillment of that promise today. The selections it contains, from today s most highly regarded contemporary Buddhist teachers, bring the Dharma eloquently to life for us in our own time, place, and culture. They demonstrate that two and a half millennia have done nothing to diminish the freshness of the Buddhist teachings, or their universal applicability to our lives.
