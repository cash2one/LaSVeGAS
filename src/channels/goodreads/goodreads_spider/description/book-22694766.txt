22694766:::::The Twelve Cataclysms: Book I - Protasis:::::The slum called Sludge is no easy place for a single mother of triplets to thrive. Fortunately, Vie is a reputable burglar who has yet to be caught. With one last heist, she hopes to take the kids out of Sludge forever. The Apocryptein is a tower of magic filled with wondrous artifacts. All Vie has to do is snatch one little crystal from inside. Her intelligence is flawed, however, and the empty edifice is not so empty. The aristocratic boor who catches her incinerates the tower in trying to capture Vie. And that is just the beginning of her troubles. The Apocryptein is no mere mystical tower, but rather a prison, one containing the twelve worst criminals in history. As punishment for her crime, Vie must work with her captor to round up the Twelve Cataclysms.
