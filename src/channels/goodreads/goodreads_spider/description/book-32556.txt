32556:::::Selected Poems and Tales:::::Edgar Allan Poe: Selected Poems and Tales/Deluxe -- FROM THE PUBLISHER: For more than a century-and-a-half, Edgar Allan Poe's poems and tales have thrilled readers with chilling accounts of matters mysterious and macabre. Their somber poetry and rich moods of menace and melancholy have conjured some of the most haunting images in American literature: the accusing echo of the tell-tale heart, the beloved but doomed Annabel Lee, the gloom-shrouded House of Usher, the maddening tortures of the pit and pendulum, the eerie and enigmatic Raven. Dramatic and irreversible, Poe's work invites us to match our darkest imaginings to his vision of the world colored by grief and madness and haunted by specters of guilt and death. This illustrated edition captures Poe's best-known works in all their shadowy splendor through the incomparable art of Mark Summers. His striking full-page color illustrations and ghostly black-and-white pencil sketches reveal the skull beneath the skin of Poe's obsessed and mournful characters and subtly express their heart of emotional darkness that gives them life and purpose. The book also features and introduction by best-selling fantasist and graphic novelist Neil Gaiman, who discusses his personal relationship with Poe's writing and its enduring impact. "Poe", he writes, "for all his short life and unfulfilled potential, remains as much read today, his finest stories as successful, as readable, as contemporary as anyone can desire." This new edition of Poe's unforgettable writing is a colorful and imaginative tribute to this most contemporary of classic writers.
