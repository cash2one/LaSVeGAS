6584019:::::The Karma Club:::::Madison Kasparkova always thought she understood how Karma works. Do good things and you'll be rewarded, do something bad and Karma will make sure you get what you deserve. But when Maddy s boyfriend cheats on her, nothing bad comes his way. That s why Maddy starts the Karma Club, to clean up the messes that the universe has left behind. Sometimes, though, it isn t wise to meddle with the universe. It turns out Karma often has plans of its own.
