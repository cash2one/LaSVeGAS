24976329:::::DOCTOR MARI TEACHES ABOUT HEALTHY SELF-LOVE:::::Today millions of people are suffering the effects of a core personal problem --not loving themselves as they should. The negative fall-out from this affliction of self-hate includes child behavior problems, anxiety disorders, depression, addictions, over-dependent relationships, and many other troubles. Yet, part of the self-hate problem comes from the lack of common knowledge and understanding of what healthy self-love is all about. In this book, health professional Denise Marie Mari, Ph.D. describes the elements of healthy friendship with oneself and gives hope for greater love. All proceeds from this book go to support clergy/religious programs of the House of Hope International. www.Lulu.com/spotlight/DoctorMari
