23572347:::::Murder Red Ink:::::In Murder Red Ink, Mord McGhee imaginatively explores the incomprehensible depths of horror, human nature, and captures the brutal reality of the monster behind the Jack the Ripper murders in 1888. Allena Gould moves among the horror brought into the future of Chicago where technological ghosts are a reality and historical interface programs can be rewritten and interacted with. Once a talented prodigy, she wrestles her way through incomprehensible nightmares. Torture and murder as seen through the eyes of the Ripper himself in a science fiction whirlwind of the darkest sort. McGhee's vision of apocalyptic dread is not for the passing reader, it's a literary odyssey of gore meant to be enjoyed by those who like to be terrifically disturbed. NY TIMES best-selling author of MEG &amp; THE LOCH notes, "Graphic. Intense. Provocative. The psychological thriller has a new voice and it is Mord McGhee." *2nd Edition includes foreword by Robert E. Anderson, Casebook.org senior forum and Jack the Ripper speaker.
