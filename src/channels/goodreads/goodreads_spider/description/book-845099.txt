845099:::::Giovanni:::::"One Million Words of Terror. It began with Clan Novel: Toreador. This book, Clan Novel: Giovanni, is the tenth in a 13-novel series concerning the Kindred -- the hugest event ever in the World of Darkness. From small details to grand spectacles, this epic series of over one million words reveals the secrets of this hidden world through the eyes of individuals on both sides of a great conflict. The continued existence of all Kindred, from the youngest neonate to the eldest Methuselah, hangs in the balance. The Enemy of My Enemy Is... My Enemy. The independent Clan Giovanni has always found its control of Boston... problematic. These necromantic wizards are shrewd, though. They have managed to keep both the Camarilla and the Sabbat from their North American home, but this task is more difficult now that a war rages between those factions. Yet every war needs its profiteers, and the Giovanni are masters of double-dealing".
