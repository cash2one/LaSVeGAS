Nestled in the sweeping hills they have always known, the house is part of their history, their heritage. But these four walls also hold a secret. When Lord Frampton dies in a skiing accident, a beautiful young woman named Phaedra appears at his funeral claiming to be the lord s illegitimate daughter. In his will, Lord Frampton has left the priceless Frampton suite of sapphires to this interloper, confirming her claim and outraging his three adult sons and widow. Eventually, however, Phaedra s sweet nature thaws the frosty relationships. She becomes the daughter that Antoinette Frampton never had and a wise and compassionate granddaughter to the formidable Dowager Lady Frampton. But an attraction grows between Phaedra and the eldest son, David. It seems an impossible love blocked by their blood connection and by the fury of one family member who is determined to expose Phaedra as a fraud. Filled with the luscious scenery and enchanting characters her fans adore, Santa Montefiore s The Woman from Paris confirms the remarkable power of love to heal broken families and tender hearts. This novel was published under the title The Summer House in the UK.
