1123897:::::All These Things Shall Give Thee Experience:::::In the midst of deep affliction, the Prophet Joseph Smith was told, "All these things shall give thee experience, and shall be for thy good." The world at that moment was shown anew that God is aware of man's sufering, and that pain is not without purpose. Such concepts are not always easy to accept, but, as Elder Maxwell observes, "the hardness is usually not in their complexity, but in the deep demands these doctrines make on us." All These Things Shall Give Thee Experience focuses on some of the "hard doctrines" that members of the Church must grapple with in the latter days. This book will help the Saints prepare for the trials ahead, while assuring them that the power of God's love is constantly available to the faithful.
