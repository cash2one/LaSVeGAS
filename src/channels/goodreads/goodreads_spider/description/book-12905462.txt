If you are a shifter of Massa, you turn around and fight. You fight, because the blood oath will have it no other way. In An Oath of the Blood, readers are introduced to four young, but powerful elemental shifters, living in the exiled land of Pyraan. When an enemy host breaches the island's shores, a deadly confrontation ensues and, despite the heroic and poignant efforts of the shifters, the land falls to the invaders. As the only survivors, the four friends are forced to flee south into the lands from which they were banished to warn of the invasion. Heartbroken and weary, the shifters soon learn that the safe haven they hoped to find is cloaked in danger. Throughout a journey fraught with magic, prophesy, betrayal, and peril, an enduring friendship prevails, love blossoms, and a riveting saga unravels.
