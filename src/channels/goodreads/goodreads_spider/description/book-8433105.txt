8433105:::::Spell It Correctly:::::In writing Spell It Correctly, author Tish Owen calls on her nearly two decades of experience reading Tarot and crafting spells for the clientele of her alternative spirituality store, Goddess and the Moon, in Nashville, Tennessee. However, just as important, she draws deeply from her wide-ranging knowledge of various spiritual paths, including the fact that she was raised in the Catholic Church. Written in her signature "Southern folk" and often humorous style, she offers an in-depth look at magic, spellcraft, and how it works - for everyone, not just Witches. Spell It Correctly includes Tish's own personally crafted, practical spells for everything from ending an addiction to stopping gossip, and even help with finding a job.
