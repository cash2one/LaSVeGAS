31701675:::::Weight of the World:::::"The world s an awfully big thing to carry by yourself." Zack lost his job, his apartment, and his hope, which is why he ends up on the roof of a high rise, certain that one final step will solve his problems. But a mysterious stranger named Rob happens to be on the roof that night too. He talks Zack down, convincing him there's still hope left in the world. Zack thinks maybe he's right, which is why he's shocked when he turns on the news the next morning to find out Rob jumped himself. Disturbed and confused, he searches for answers, starting with Rob s brother Tommy Rayburn. It s been Tommy s job to take care of his brother since they were kids, taking the blows from their father so Rob wouldn t have to. Tommy thought he could protect him, even if it meant carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders. Considering Rob threw himself off a building, he obviously couldn't. Then he meets Zack, a friend of Rob s who s suspiciously evasive about how they knew each other. But they re both grieving and determined to find out why Rob jumped. Answers don t come easily, and soon they re soothing each other with sweat-slicked, passionate encounters. Hot as things get in the bedroom, it doesn t take them long to realize there s more between them than mind-blowing sex and their pain. But the heaviness is still there, threatening to pull them under, and if they can t open up with each other to lighten the load, the weight just might be enough to crush them both.
