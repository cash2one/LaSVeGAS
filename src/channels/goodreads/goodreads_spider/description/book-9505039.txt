9505039:::::Valle:::::The ominous Valle Faction vows to gain possession of what the Equites has hidden in the well protected Island Coven. Just as Emily thinks she s found peace in the volatile world of the heku, she s brutally ripped from the protective walls of Chevalier s coven and thrown into the harsh reality of a Valle prison. Chevalier confronts the Valle and Equites Elders about Emily, and in doing so, endangers his own life. Emily s devout loyalties to the heku faction gain respect for her among the Equites Council and ensure her place among the immortal. The Valle overstep, and the violent war that ensues endangers Chevalier s peaceful coven and exposes traitors among the Equites. While Chevalier fights to protect Emily and his coven, the Equites Faction faces an even bigger crisis when they decide a change of leadership is long past due. The task falls to the Chief Enforcer, and Chevalier is sent on a mission that could end the Council s turmoil. The operation could not only threaten his life, but also his relationship with Emily. Emily begins learning even more about the heku and its evil past when she comes face-to-face with one of the original heku, an Ancient. She feels the strain as she s taken from the comfortable coven, and even with Kyle at her side, can t find her way in the new life. Emily starts to wonder if she s not only a danger to the heku, but if she would be safer returning to the world of the mortal and leaving her beloved heku behind. When Emily gives birth, the Valle renew their drive to capture the last Winchester heir, and even the Equites Elders begin to feel the need to defend her.
