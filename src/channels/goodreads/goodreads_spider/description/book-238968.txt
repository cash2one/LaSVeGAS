So with only a motley band of companions, Kale sets out on a desperate quest to rescue the second meech, to free those dragons already enslaved, and to thwart Risto s devious plans. It s up to Kale to lead the search and to embrace the role that s rightfully hers. But will her efforts be enough to save the land of Amara from the dark future that awaits at Risto s hands?
