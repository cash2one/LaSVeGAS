21459383:::::The Wild Side:::::ARE YOU READY TO TAKE A WALK? Alasdair Masters is in a rut. He just hit forty, has been nearly celibate for the past year, and his life has turned into a daily sequence of lonely patterns that revolve around avoiding human contact. His tidy life is turned on its head when a hot young blonde at the gym that s been pseudo-stalking him decides to rock his world. A very young blonde. Way, way too young for him. The problem is, he can t seem to tell her no, and she just keeps coming back for more. It doesn t help that he s ninety percent sure she s a criminal, and still, he can t seem to turn her down. What is a dull introvert to do when a chaotic cyclone that oozes sexuality comes twisting into his life? At first, he thinks she ll give him a heart attack, but after his twenty-year marriage ended a year ago, he s been a little lost, and when she comes crashing into his life, he realizes that he s never felt more alive. Is a walk on the wild side just what he needs to get his life on track or a disaster in the making? Is it possible for someone that much younger to be just what he needs, or is she a fortune hunter, as everyone keeps telling him? Is it his hormones telling him that the mysterious younger woman is the one, or could it be more?
