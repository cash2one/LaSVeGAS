4713862:::::Garcia Marquez: Los Funerales de la Mama Grande:::::Gabriel Garcia Marquez is the most celebrated, and most widely read, Latin American novelist of his generation. His highly-acclaimed work includes One Hundred Years of Solitude, The Autumn of the Patriarch and Love in the Time of Cholera. He won the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1982 for his literary production prior to Chronicle of a Death Foretold. A principal exponent of 'magical realism', his work forms a significant part of the debate about postmodernist writing, and the study of fantasy as a genre. Dr. Fiddian's detailed and accessible Introduction places Marquez's work in the contexts of national, regional (Caribbean) and continental (Latin American) writing and develops a coherent overview of the author's literary output. The essays selected for inclusion in this collection bring together some of the most up-to-date and authoritative assessments of Marquez's writing, from early stories and novellas, through the major novels, up to Love in the Time of Cholera. Featuring a variety of critical approaches, this fascinating study provides the first annotated anthology of criticism in English.
