(Literary) a.: to feel a strong emotion but keep it hidden b.: to be felt strongly by someone without being directly shown or expressed Some connections are so intense, so deep that they span years. Starting with nothing more than a casual conversation, a look in the eye, a touch --but the point is they start. They smolder with a quiet intensity that eventually leads to combustion. Taylor Roberts had been in love with her brother s best friend for as long as she could remember. It was a love left burning in her heart--pointless, because it was love never returned. Noah Renegade Hudson had life knock him down more than once. As Sergeant of Arms of the Devil Chasers, he s known for not letting people get too close. The day he met Taylor, a change ignited within him, and he wanted to reach out and claim her. She was innocent and untouched though, so he made himself walked away. When both Taylor and Renegade s lives are rocked by tragedy, can they find comfort in each other s arms? Or will old wounds and scars tear them apart forever? In hearts where pain, love, and passion lie smoldering... will anything survive the blast when the fire sparks?
