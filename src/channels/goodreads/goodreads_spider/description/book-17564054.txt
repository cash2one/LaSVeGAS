17564054:::::Who He Is:::::Eliza Smith has never been the one to seek a relationship. She s never dated a guy in her life, never even hugged a man (outside of her father/manager of the hot and popular rock band, FireNine) but when she decides to spend her summer on tour with FireNine, it all changes. Eliza really gets to meet Gage Grendel - her former crush from high school and the lead singer of FireNine - and witness sides to him to which she ll begin to truly despise. She ll ignore him, she ll dislike his ways, she ll do anything to try and stay away from him until Gage finally gets her to slip up and give in. She agrees on a casual fling with Gage, but soon they ll both see how the fling will blur into something they can t control and when it s finally time for Eliza to go and accomplish her own dreams, she ll know there s more she took from Gage than she ever thought possible.
