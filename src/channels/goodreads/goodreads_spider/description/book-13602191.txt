13602191:::::Servant To The Wolf:::::In 106 A.D., a fifteen year old slave boy comes face to face with the hazards of arrogance bigotry and hatred: primarily his own. Marcus has a great life. He's well-fed, well-educated, good-looking and respected by everyone around him, not bad for a rich man's personal servant living in the heart of the Roman Empire. Blacksmith Lupus, "the Wolf," will always carry the scars of his own experience with slavery. A foreign born "barbarian" and now a freedman, Lupus works his trade and lives a simple life, trying to put his past behind him. When a twist of fate causes Marcus to tumble from his comfortable lifestyle into the ownership of Lupus, conflict erupts between the prideful slave and the humble smith. But there just might be more to Lupus than meets the eye. When danger threatens, maybe it's not such a bad thing to be a Servant to the Wolf.
