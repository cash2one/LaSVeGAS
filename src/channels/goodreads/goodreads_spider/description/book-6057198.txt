6057198:::::Free in Christ:::::This book is for you who are still asking questions, searching and trying to be disciples in the fuller sense of life-long learners. It is a message of reappraisal, correction, and readjustment. In interesting style that makes reading easy, with intelligent challenge of the simplistic traditions of the Church of Christ, and with positive, scriptural answers, the auther leads the reader in a most challenging journey from our divisive legalism into unifying and liberating grace. This is no bitter, negative assault, but it is a compassionate review and emphasis of our need for reform. It may be unsettling to those who think that we have all the neat answers already. But there is cheering promise that, after the chains of tradition and conditioning have been broken, you can enjoy true freedom in Christ and a new-found peace that passes understanding.
