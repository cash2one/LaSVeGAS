264891:::::Genesis:::::"From pre-Columbian creation myths and the first European voyages of discovery and conquest to the Age of Reagan, here is 'nothing less than a unified history of the Western Hemisphere... recounted in vivid prose.'"--The New Yorker A unique and epic history, Eduardo Galeano's Memory of Fire trilogy is an outstanding Latin American eye view of the making of the New World. From its first English language publication in 1985 it has been recognized as a classic of political engagement, original research, and literary form. Memory of Fire is devastating, triumphant... sure to scorch the sensibility of English-language readers. (New York Times) An epic work of literary creation... there could be no greater vindication of the wonders of the lands and people of Latin America than Memory of Fire. (Washington Post) [Memory of Fire] will reveal to you the meaning of the New World as it was, and of the world as we have it now. (Boston Globe) A book as fascinating as the history it relates.... Galeano is a satirist, realist, and historian, and... deserves mention alongside John Dos Passos, Bernard DeVoto, and Gabriel Garcia Marquez. (Los Angeles Times)
