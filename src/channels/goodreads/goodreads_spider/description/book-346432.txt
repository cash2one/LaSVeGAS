346432:::::What's Right: The New Conservative Majority And The Remaking Of America:::::David Frum celebrates a conservatism that defends both liberty and morality. Frum dissects such current political figures as Pat Buchanan, Newt Gingrich, Colin Powell, and Jack Kemp, offering insight into the mechanics of Republican party politics as well. Whether the issue is health care, social programs, supply-side tax cutting, crime, or censorship, Frum cuts to the essential matters of principle with passion and wit. He makes a powerful case for Republicans to reject populism, protectionism, and nationalism and return to their core doctrines: smaller government and American world leadership.
