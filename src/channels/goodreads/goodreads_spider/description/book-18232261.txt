18232261:::::The Missing Fathers:::::There is a special day called Father's day but not everyone will see it that way. Anthony could rip his heart out whenever he heard the word father because he had none, yet he desperately wanted to know someone he could call father. As luck would have it, his father finally turned up after thirteen years; but instead of bringing him fortune and happiness, he brought a host of misfortune, tangled with other fathers doing the dirt against their own off-springs. The Missing Fathers is a follow up of the novel A Boy's Cry by the author and teacher, Andrew Beckford.
