1197083:::::Show Adult:::::Two film-scripts, the first about editing and content, the second concerned with acting, direction, and instructions/vanity. This fascinating work uses pornography as a Skinner box experiment and co-opts the behaviourist methodology of psychologist Harry Harlow in a violent new work which goes beyond pornography to investigate the very experience of pornography itself. Within this construct Sotos covers such cases as child porn star Masha Allen, murder victim Carlie Brucie and her prostitute mother Susan Schorpen, and the infant-raping babysitters Alan Webster and Tanya French. He also dissects TV shows Supernanny and To Catch A Predator as publicly acceptable forms of pornography.
