263971:::::The Case for Faith: A Journalist Investigates the Toughest Objections to Christianity:::::Was God telling the truth when he said, "You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart?" In his #1 best-seller The Case for Christ , Lee Strobel examined the claims of Christ, reaching the hard-won verdict that Jesus is God's unique son. But despite the compelling historical evidence that Strobel presented, many people grapple with serious concerns about faith in God. As in a court of law, they want to shout, "Objection!"They say,"If God is love, then what about all the suffering in our world?" In The Case for Faith , Strobel turns his skills to the most persistent emotional objections to belief- the eight "heart" barriers to faith. The Case for Faith is for those who may be feeling attracted to Jesus but who are faced with intellectual barriers standing squarely in their path. For Christians, it will deepen their convictions and give them fresh confidence in discussing Christianity with even their most skeptical friends.
