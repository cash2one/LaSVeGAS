18007326:::::Girls I've Run Away With:::::Girls I've Run Away With is a story of first love between a rascally tomboy skater-girl and her wild-dreamer of a best friend, and what happens when the entire world tries to keep them apart. Rhiannon Argo captures the tough reality of queer teens with such playful sweetness you almost forget to worry about them as they take off on a string of outlandish, take-no-prisoners attempts to save themselves from a world of cruddy grown-ups hell-bent on killing beauty and love. I couldn't put this book down! --Michelle Tea, author of Mermaid in Chelsea Creek
