25814583:::::The Isle of the Lost:::::Twenty years ago, all the evil villains were banished from the kingdom of Auradon to the Isle of the Lost - a dark and dreary place protected by a force field that makes it impossible for them to leave. Stripped of their magical powers, the villains and their children now live in total isolation, forgotten by the world. But hidden in the Forbidden Fortress is a Dragon's Eye: the villains' only hope of escape. Only the cleverest, evilest, nastiest villain can find it ...who will it be? In the quest for the Dragon's Eye, the villains' kids are proof that, even though you come from an evil family tree, being good ain't so bad.
