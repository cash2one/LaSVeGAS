622156:::::Folklore and Fable: Aesop, Grimm, Andersen:::::1909. Many tales have been collected and they are represented in the present volume by the household tales preserved by Grimm. Far earlier written down, but less primitive in kind, are the Aesopic Fables. Still more recent, both in kind and in date, are the Wonder stories of modern manufacture represented here by the tales of Hans Christian Andersen. Andersen had a marvelous knack of entertaining children by repeating old folk tales of the type collected by Grimm; and his success in this led him on to attempt inventing new ones.
