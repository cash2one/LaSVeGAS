21239135:::::Flight of Fancy:::::The first book was, "The Fancy" about Suga. This is the second book in our Cora's daughters - The Fancy Series. "Flight of Fancy" About Suga's older sister, Asiza. As in the case of all siblings, each child is different - and Asiza is most certainly one of Cora's daughters who has a problem - even though all six of her girls were raised to be a Fancy... Asiza's not interested. She has looks, as beautiful as they come, hazel green eyes to mesmerize. An appearence as delicate, as desirable, and as sweet as they come, however she is nothing of the sort. The man that purchased her - hadn't a clue of what he was getting himself into - nor his friends for that matter. If they only knew, they were about to enjoy the last of many good time - private parties with his new - Fancy. Crashing their party, sends this fancy on the run! Those giving chase after her would learn the hard way, Asiza was different - a search party with the dogs, simply would not do. Desperate, the town hires a bounty hunter - Broc Wolf. They give him specific instructions. Bring her back DEAD - not alive. Bring back her head. Something told Broc Wolf not to accept the job, in fact before he even sets off, he doubts his ability to fulfill their request. After all, he'd never raised his hand in violence to a woman before in his life. Yet, of all the warnings they gave, not one of them cautioned him to guard his heart - once his eyes beheld the fancy - Asiza - he knew immediately, all bets were off.
