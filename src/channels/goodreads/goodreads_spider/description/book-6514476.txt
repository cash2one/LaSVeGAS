6514476:::::Night Runner:::::For Zack Thomson, life in the Nicholls Ward wasn't so bad. After his parents died, he developed strange allergies, and the mental institution was the only place where he could be properly looked after. As strange as it was, it was home. But that all changes the night a stranger on a Harley crashes through the front doors and tells him to run . Along with his best friend Charlie and a girl he may or may not be falling in love with, Zack does just that: run . Under the cover of night, hiding amongst the shadows, he races for the truth.
