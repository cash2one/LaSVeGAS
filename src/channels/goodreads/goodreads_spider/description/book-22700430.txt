22700430:::::Tagged & Ashed:::::The cunning predator, the willing prey, and a weekend neither of them will be able to forget... ever. Ash Branderwood was told one thing before going to her best friend's brother's wedding - don't get Tagged. There's always that one guy you shouldn't want, but you just can't help yourself. He's going to be horrible for your health, he'll probably break your heart, but he's going to be so much fun while he's doing it. Stay away. Ash Branderwood can't seem to heed such logic when she meets playboy millionaire Tag Masters. Weddings always seem to create a false sense of intimacy, but Ash doesn't take that into consideration when she starts fantasizing about the man she can't possibly tame. She's a good girl... well, good enough. She's never really taken any chances or done something irrational or foolish. Tag is just the person to rectify that for her. Tag has never done anything but take chances. He never had anything to lose - so he risked it all and built his name up in Sterling Shore. Meaningless sex is one of his many hobbies, and he's not looking to settle down any time soon. After all, these are the best years of his life. But, one look at Ash, and he almost forgets his own name. And what in the hell is she doing at Wren's wedding with Bity? Tag is almost furious when he sees Billy Prize brought a girl as stunning as Ash, considering Tag doesn't feel as though Billy deserves such a thing. He has to have her... at least once... possibly twice. It was supposed to be a weekend of fun, one she'd remember just long enough to forget. But she quickly realizes there's one thing for sure... she's never going to be able to forget Tag Masters, only it isn't for reasons one might think. All hell breaks loose when secrets emerge, but when Ash's life is endangered, Tag has to put aside his own issues to keep her safe.
