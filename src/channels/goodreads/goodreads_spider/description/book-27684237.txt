27684237:::::Rio de Janeiro: Everything You Need to Know:::::Popularly known as Rio, or 'the City that never sleeps', Rio de Janeiro, the capital of the State of Rio de Janeiro, is vibrant and full of life. It is Brazil's most famous and second largest City after Sao Paulo. Rio is known for many things: it is the third largest Metropolis in the whole of South America, one of the top visited Cities in the world, and every tourist's dream destination. Rio de Janeiro is an unforgettable City. It is littered with plenty of beaches, breathtaking mountains, striking architecture, and lush vegetation. From the famous Ipanema and Copacabana beaches; where playing, swimming, strolling, and sunbathing are just but a few of the day's activities, to the county's and world's largest Art Deco statue; Christ the Redeemer, perched elegantly on Corcovado Mountain, and to the city's unforgettable annual Carnival celebrations marked with extravaganzas of feasting, music, dance, and costumed revelry, you will never want to get out of Rio! And most significant, the people of Rio; Cariocas, are warm, welcoming, and truly lovable. No wonder there is a widespread adage that 'it's easier to gain entry into Rio than to want to exit it'.
