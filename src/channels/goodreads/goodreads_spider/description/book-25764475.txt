25764475:::::How to Kill an Incubus:::::Rainelle, you were eye-f***ing me in the casino. Rae couldn't exactly deny what Andrei, the king of the incubi, said so matter-of-factly. But she is her father's daughter and having a forbidden liaison with a sinfully irresistible demon king is not something her demon hunter father would have approved of. With just one glance from Andrei's piercing cerulean eyes, however, she found herself being plunged into delightful unknown territories, and only half-caring whether she should sink or swim. Should she fight her unholy but oh-so-delicious attraction to the dark lord, or ignore the warnings of her demon hunter blood and just give in to the indescribable enticing pleasures he brings her? If you're a fan sexy romantic comedies with a dash of supernatural like First Grave on the Right and Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter , then this charming story of a beautiful sassy private investigator and her seductive drop-dead gorgeous demon king is for you!
