18641060:::::Connor:::::I, Connor, thought I was the average sarcastic teenager, living a normal life like everyone else with a crazy, annoying family. Wrong. I recently discovered that I have certain abilities. Abilities that link me to others like me, and others, unlike me, who want to cause me harm. I found out this world is not what I thought, as well as the strange creatures in it, and that frightens me. I had to grow up fast and find the strength to defend myself from those beings who don t want me here or who will take my strengths by any means necessary. Throughout this craziness, I met a wonderful guy named Tony, who has abilities too. With him and several others like us we discover who we are and how we came to be. Then there is Ronin, a being who is young, smart, and cunning. He is set on taking his revenge out on me yet I have no idea why.
