As a result, the girl he loved died while he was powerless to save her. He never forgave himself. Now, he has the opportunity to change that event and shape the past to his own design. Haunted by his mistakes, Joseph invents the world's first working time machine--and he's going back to make things right. Unfortunately, each time he steps through the portal, things get worse. But he will find a way to save her--no matter what the consequences. And if he succeeds, the last fifteen years will have never happened. The only person who can stop him is Tim Jarrell, Joseph's best friend who's running through the years to reach him before it's too late. Two men fight to control yesterday. Only one will succeed. The race has begun. The past...is history.
