14402211:::::Heartbreak and Happiness:::::I've been writing poetry since I was ten years old. It's the easiest way for me to deal with whatever's going on in my life at any given moment, especially the really good or the really bad. This is a collection of various things I've written through the years, and I hope you can find at least one poem in here to touch your heart.
