A heretic must rally believers for a cause he never shared. And four youngsters find that what started as a simple adventure imitating exploits in Earthling books by Verne and Twain leads them to the dark abyss of mystery. Meanwhile, the Streaker , with her fugitive dolphin crew, arrives at last on Jijo in a desperate search for refuge. Yet what the crew finds instead is a secret hidden since the galaxies first spawned intelligence a secret that could mean salvation for the planet and its inhabitants or their ultimate annihilation.
