25553015:::::When an Alpha Purrs:::::A lion s pride isn t defined only by those he commands but also resides with his hair, so when a human dares to butcher Arik s mane, he gets his revenge and claims her as his mate. A billionaire CEO and leader of the largest East Coast pride, Arik is a ladies man and a lion. Used to commanding others, and obedience, he can t believe it when a hairdresser with tempting curves chops off a hunk of his precious mane. But her biggest mistake is in running from him. Run as fast as you can, little mouse, because this cat loves to chase and pounce. Oh, and he also likes to nibble on tender bits. What he doesn t expect is to fall for a human woman, a woman who can make the impossible happen because everyone knows lions can t purr until now.
