20451857:::::The Shifted:::::Kale Rollins' life has become a living nightmare. As if it wasn't awkward enough being an adopted normal kid in a family of purebred shape shifters, he was now being transferred to a new school made solely for their kind. And it gets worse. He must attend this school under the pretense that he too is a shape shifter, in order to "babysit" his fourteen year old brother who has suddenly shifted a year earlier than expected. However, with the new found knowledge that shape shifting families are mysteriously disappearing, Kale wonders if attending Emerson Fox Academy is actually as safe as it seems. Before he even reaches the school, he finds himself in the middle of a feud that could become life-threatening to him and his brother. Unexpectedly friendships are formed as he chooses a side - So are enemies. There is one girl though through it all that makes him want to stay. Except the closer he gets to Lavallette Waters, the harder it is to keep up his facade. As secrets start to unravel around him, Kale wonders what will happen next... Will "babysitting" his brother be the death of him? Can he really trust Lavallette? And how much more time do they have before someone they care about disappears?
