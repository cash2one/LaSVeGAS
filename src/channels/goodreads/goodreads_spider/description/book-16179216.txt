16179216:::::Dear Killer:::::Rule One Nothing is right, nothing is wrong. Rule Two Be careful. Rule Three Fight using your legs whenever possible, because they re the strongest part of your body. Your arms are the weakest. Rule Four Hit to kill. The first blow should be the last, if at all possible. Rule Five The letters are the law. Kit takes her role as London s notorious Perfect Killer seriously. The letters and cash that come to her via a secret mailbox are not a game; choosing who to kill is not an impulse decision. Every letter she receives begins with Dear Killer, and every time Kit murders, she leaves a letter with the dead body. Her moral nihilism and thus her murders are a way of life the only way of life she has ever known. But when a letter appears in the mailbox that will have the power to topple Kit s convictions as perfectly as she commits her murders, she must make a decision: follow the only rules she has ever known, or challenge Rule One, and go from there. Katherine Ewell s Dear Killer is a sinister psychological thriller that explores the thin line between good and evil, and the messiness of that inevitable moment when life contradicts everything you believe.
