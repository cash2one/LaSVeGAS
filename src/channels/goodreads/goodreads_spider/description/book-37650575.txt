37650575:::::Cross the Hall Magic:::::Magic is all around. You just have to believe. Do you believe? Life is too short to be cynical. So smile, dare to believe and leave the door open for Magic. I live by those words. I ve searched the world for answers to questions that only seem to lead to more questions. Imagine my surprise when I discover Magic right across the hall... wearing nothing but an apron and a smile... I m Laney Evans, and I believe in Magic. The secret ingredient is always Magic." I ve lived my whole life with Magic surrounded by a wacky, prank crazed, magical family. I thought I had the recipe for happiness all spelled out until I caught sight of Laney Evans, and now I know that the best is yet to come! I m Max Cross, and I believe in love at first sight. (I m not a creeper, damn it.)
