115375:::::Problem Solving Using C: Structured Programing Techniques:::::This book is suitable for students with little or no programming background. The complete book can easily be covered in a one-semester or one-quarter introductory course on problem solving. The book's main emphasis is problem solving; the C programming language is used as the vehicle for problem solving. To this end, a sufficient subset of the C language is presented in the book. However the book does not attempt to cover the complete C spectrum but stresses only the features essential to problem solving in the first course in computing. Therefore, this book is not a comprehensive C reference book but a textbook for students who want to learn problem solving using computers, structured procedural programming, and the standard C language.
