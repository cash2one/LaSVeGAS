34454485:::::Tied:::::Me My childhood was stolen by a horrible man when I was kidnapped at five years old. I've forgotten what love, happiness, and hope feels like. I am numb and lost, clinging to a childhood fairytale. Him He's possibly as damaged as I am. Maybe even more. He's scarred just as much on the inside as the outside. Just like me. Haunted by his own tragic past, he doesn't speak or smile. He chooses to live in the woods, far away from society. I've been told to stay away from him, but I can't because he's the one who saved my life. He's also the only one who has ever made me feel. And now, I want to make him feel, too. I'd do anything just to see him smile-especially at me. ** Can be read stand-alone. ** This is a slow burn romance. It is not erotica, nor are there lots of sex scenes. This is about two lonely, damaged people learning to trust, love, and find happiness. Their story does not revolve around sex. ** There is no cheating in this book. ** While the heroine was kidnapped and abused mentally and physically as a child, I do not give any graphic details about what happened to her out of respect to survivors who may read this book. This book focuses on hope and moving forward and I felt there was no need to include graphic details to get the point across.
