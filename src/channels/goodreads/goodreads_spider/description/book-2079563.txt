2079563:::::Jumping to Confusions:::::A brilliantly funny tale of romantic confusion! Cat is fat and boring - or so she thinks. Her mum is a stick insect and so is her twin sister Tessa - a bit of a spoilt brat who can get any boy she wants. There's a new arrival in their town from the USA - Josh, the son of their dad's boss. He's gorgeous so Tessa is keen and Cat knows she doesn't have a chance... But Josh seems strangely uninterested in Tess. Cat thinks there must be more to the situation... She and Josh become friends and eventually she thinks she's got to the bottom of the mystery...maybe Josh just isn't into girls at all...? Now she has a new best gay friend, cat's life is much happier, and she and Josh get on wonderfully. If only things could stay that simple...
