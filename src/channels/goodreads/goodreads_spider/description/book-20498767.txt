20498767:::::Consequence:::::Maggie and Caleb are married, leaders of their people, parents to their children, and happier than they ever dreamed, even with the visions they saw of it to prove it so. The council is still rebelling against Maggie s changes, but this time it s different. It s almost as if something or someone is behind them, pulling the strings and making decisions for them. And Maggie is having strange visions that only she can see, leaving Caleb helpless to help her. But when her visions start to warn her that their daughter, Ava, will one day be in danger, they ll do anything it takes to find out what s going on and how to stop it, even paying a visit to a previous Visionary. Maggie and Caleb must find out who or what is behind it all and stop them before Maggie is one vision too late.
