258392:::::Gormenghast:::::Titus Groan is seven years old. Lord and heir to the crumbling castle Gormenghast. A gothic labyrinth of roofs and turrets, cloisters and corridors, stairwells and dungeons, it is also the cobwebbed kingdom of Byzantine government and age-old rituals, a world primed to implode beneath the weight of centuries of intrigue, treachery, and death. Steerpike, who began his climb across the roofs when Titus was born, is now ascending the spiral staircase to the heart of the castle, and in his wake lie imprisonment, manipulation, and murder. Gormenghast is the second volume in Mervyn Peake s widely acclaimed trilogy, but it is much more than a sequel to Titus Groan it is an enrichment and deepening of that book. The Gormenghast Trilogy ranks as one of the twentieth century s most remarkable feats of imaginative writing.
