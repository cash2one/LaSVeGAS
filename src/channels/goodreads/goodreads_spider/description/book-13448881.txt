13448881:::::The Devil's Scribe:::::After decades of running from her past, Lanore McIlvrae returns to America for the first time in 20 years to confront the source of her fear. The year is 1846 and Lanore Lanny has just landed in Baltimore after a long transatlantic crossing. That very night, she meets an unattractive man with a high forehead and sunken eyes, and a tiny, pinched mouth like a parrot s beak who claims to write stories so dark and unsettling that he could be the Devil s Scribe. His name? Edgar Allan Poe. Has Lanny finally met her match in this macabre man or is it the other way around?
