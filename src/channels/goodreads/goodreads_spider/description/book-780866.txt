A fellowship of three had been forged, companions brought together by fate, driven by prophecy: Rhapsody, a Singer of great talent and beauty; Achmed, an assassin with unearthly talents; and Grunthor, a giant of jolly disposition and lethal skill with weapons. The three overcame great adversity in defeating the F'dor--an ancient evil being intent on destroying the world--their battle culminating in Destiny , a thundering crescendo of tragedy, love, and triumph of the human spirit over world-shattering cataclysm. Now comes... Requiem for the Sun , Sequel to the USA Today bestselling Rhapsody Trilogy It has been three years since their devastating battle, and peace has settled across their land.
