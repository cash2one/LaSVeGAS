26867235:::::Fantasy, Dreams, Battles & Magic:::::Who knew? The top authority on firearms, weapons, and self defense law in Florida is also the #1 ranked "best fantasy poet" on the web! Yup, believe it or not, Jon Gutmacher, the firearms attorney, is also a famous web poet, and now his first book of fantasy poetry is finally out. The book is amazing! It's done in full color, both inside and outside. It has 27 of the "best" fantasy poems from his website, all illustrated in color on a four color press. Even the pages have classic borders! Gutmacher left nothing to spare when he had this book printed, and the cover itself, is a piece of artwork! Each poem is a complete story. Some of romance. Some of battles. Some science fiction. Some of magic, witches, and even dragons! All are amazing - and there's been nothing like it since Lord Tennyson wrote "The Charge of the Light Brigade" almost two hundred years ago! The Illustrations are absolutely beautiful and the poems are full of courage, love, loyalty, and honor. This is a great inspirational book for any age, and a terrific gift for anyone. Be one of the first people to buy and rate this great read. If you love poetry the way it used to be - where it actually told a story, or left a tear in your eye - this is the book for you.
