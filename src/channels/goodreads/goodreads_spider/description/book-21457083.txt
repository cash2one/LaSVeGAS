21457083:::::Collide:::::Melina Rowe never thought her quiet, simple life could change to one full of fear and confusion just by accidentally bumping into someone. But after she collides with an elderly man named Walter, she starts to hear people s thoughts and have unsettling visions. Walter reveals himself as a guiding angel and explains to Melina that she s a rare type of human who can absorb angel powers. But her special ability is more of a problem for her than a gift. The powers are too strong for humans and will eventually kill Melina unless she can successfully use them to help a select individual who s in need of guidance. Her chances are slim, though, seeing that the handful of other humans this has happened to before didn't survive. Scared for her life, Melina desperately tries to help a young man named Lee, but his continual resistance and her struggle with the powers make it almost impossible. Her situation only grows worse when a trio of soul-snatching demons is sent by an unknown entity to take her soul and kill her. As a determined Walter sets out to discover who sent the demons and why, Melina must defend herself from their relentless attacks all while trying to use powers she doesn t fully understand to help someone who doesn t want to be helped. If she can t figure out how to break through to Lee, the powers will ultimately destroy her. But if the powers don t kill her first, the demons will.
