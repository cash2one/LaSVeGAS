1593668:::::The Plains:::::Fiction. Born in Melbourne, Austrailia, in 1939, Gerald Murnane recently retired as the senior lecturer in fiction writing at Deakin University with a reputation as one of the finest writers in his country. He is the author of seven highly praised books of fiction, most of which are still widely unknown and underappreciated by American readers. "The Plains is parable, fable, allegory, analogue, mythology, and vision. It is also subtly satirical and often ingeniously funny . . . Gerald Murnane is unquestionably one of the most original writers working in Australia today and THE PLAINS is a fascinating and rewarding book"--The Australian. Foreword by Andrew Zawacki, editor of VERSE magazine. The Plains was first published in Austrailia in 1982.
