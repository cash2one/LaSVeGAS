274138:::::Charmed Circle:::::Life in Plymouth, Massachusetts, may not be fast-paced, but it's certainly busy enough for Cass Shipton. Between her thriving herbalist business and her circle of devoted friends--not to mention tending to the needs of her eccentric mutt, Scruffy--Cass has her hands full. The last thing she needs is to take a troubled teen under her wing, but when Winifred "Freddie" McGinty shows up, trailing chaos in her wake, Cass feels it's her duty to help the girl understand and control the powerful gifts she's been given...gifts that remind Cass of those rare abilities she shares with her friends. Gifts that may once again be leading them into trouble... All Plymouth is talking about the mysterious disappearance of a local family, and Cass has sensed something foreboding--chilling images of tall Maine trees, deadly secrets, a shallow grave, and a man whose hidden past is marked by shocking violence. Desperate to find the missing family before it's too late, Cass calls on the circle to help her unmask a cunning and vicious killer...one with a direct link to the girl Cass has brought into their fold, leaving them all vulnerable to an unimaginable danger...
