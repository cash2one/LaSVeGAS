18009844:::::Meet Me at the Altar:::::Shana Jackson used to believe in love. That was until she caught her husband in the arms of another man. Derek Chance is used to a challenge; so if Shana didn't want him to romance her and treat her like the queen she is, then she should have never sat by him during Sunday morning service. Shawn McAllister has everything he could ever want. He has prestige, wealth, a beautiful wife and daughter. So why is he squandering it on other women? Sherry Coleman is a gold digger and proud of it. You better watch out, because she might be messing with your husband. Meet Me at the Altar chronicles the life of four adults as they battle domestic violence, divorce, low self esteem, and prostitution to finding the perfect peace within themselves and discovering that true love comes from God first. Will they accept God's invitation?
