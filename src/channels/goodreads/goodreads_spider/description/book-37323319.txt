37323319:::::Dragon Prow Shadow:::::Monsters under the bed, everyone has them; unfortunately for Robert, his are a rowdy bunch and they keep him awake at night. With the aid of a night light and some soothing nature sounds to keep him company, a new world opens up, bringing new possibilities. When ocean waves are lapping gently against the side of his bed, he is surprised to find himself on a Viking longboat, though not quite as surprised as the Vikings. When he inadvertently helps to see off a Loki-Spawn, the Vikings claim him as their lucky charm. By now, you might be thinking is this for me, it is, it s for everyone. It s about someone overcoming their fears and winning the day, it s about escaping to new adventures and facing whatever comes at you. Because sometimes, all you really need is a small person s big imagination.
