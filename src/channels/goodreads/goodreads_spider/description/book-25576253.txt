25576253:::::Are We There Yet?: The Ultimate Challenge:::::" How many of us have to die at the hands of our own people before we say enough is enough to black-on-black violence? How long will we continue on this path of self-destruction? How long will we continue to live our lives in a position of weakness and ignorance? In Are We There Yet? , author Martin L. Davis provides the blueprint for what people of color need to do to change their standing in American society and throughout the world. It delivers a blow-by-blow, step-by-step, challenge-by-challenge outline that speaks directly to the heart of the ills black people face today. It addresses how black Americans can correct those ills internally, without outside help or influence. Complete with concrete directives, initiatives, and challenges to the black population, Are We There Yet? clearly dictates that black Americans take responsibility and be accountable for their actions and inactions. Davis maintains that following the multiple directives and challenges collectively will guarantee a dramatic and positive change in our communities, our place in American society, and better interaction among one another as a people.
