1007870:::::Leepike Ridge:::::Before he wrote the bestselling 100 Cupboards trilogy and Ashtown Burials series , N. D. Wilson delighted readers with his first unforgettable action-adventure story of survival. . . . Thomas Hammond has always lived next to Leepike Ridge, but he never imagined he might end up lost beneath it! The night Tom s schoolteacher comes to dinner and asks Tom s mother to marry him, Tom slips out of the house and escapes down a nearby stream on a floating slab of packing foam. The night and stars lull Tom to sleep, and when he wakes, he has ridden his foam raft all the way to the ridge, where the stream dives underground. Flung over rapids and tossed through chasms, Tom finally hits shore, sore but alive. What Tom finds under Leepike Ridge a dog, a flashlight, a castaway, a tomb, and buried treasure will answer questions he hadn t known to ask, and change his life forever. Now, if only he can find his way home again. . . .
