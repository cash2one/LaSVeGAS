22266009:::::Iris:::::ARE YOU READY FOR A TWIST? Who is Iris? Where did she come from? Where has she gone? Alasdair Masters has more questions than answers about his new, too young obsession, and when he finds out she s been lying to him, from their first meeting to their last one, he s more confused than ever about her feelings, her intentions. And what s just as confusing are his own feelings. Has he turned something purely physical into something emotional in his own head? Is any of it mutual? The only thing he doesn t question is whether he ll keep going back for more. DAIR Me, I was simple. I was order. A very neat, efficient machine that ran on nothing but air. Me plus anyone else, well, that was another matter. And me plus Iris, that was a monster of a machine, with all gears going at different speeds, some spinning off their hinges, just going mad, but it was a wonderful madness, at full throttle, misfiring in all directions. It felt wonderful and dreadful. I was breaking down, and it felt amazing. And terrifying. This book is intended for readers 18 and up.
