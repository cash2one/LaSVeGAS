15825603:::::Arctic Absolution:::::Dixon Rowe is a good man and a good cop who keeps finding himself in bed with the enemy. After he picks up a young ex-con named Jaye Larson for stealing food, Dixon is seduced by the possibility of helping someone truly in need. He tells himself he s assisting young Jaye out of the goodness of his heart not because of how sexy Jaye is under all of the tattoos and defiance. But temptation entangles them as the malicious ghosts of Jaye's past returns to haunt their every step. Jaye s ghosts are bad enough, but the demon from Dixon's past is real enough to put both of their lives in danger. (M/M)
