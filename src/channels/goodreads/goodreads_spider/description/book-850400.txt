850400:::::Sea Horse:::::Ever since they formed The Saddle Club, Stevie, Carole, and Lisa have been inseparable. So they're all feeling a little sad at the thought of not being together for the Christmas holidays. But while Lisa is riding along the beautiful beaches of sunny San Marco, Stevie will be combing the mall for the perfect New Year's Eve dress. And Carole will be training Starlight, the gorgeous bay gelding she got for Christmas! But no one's holiday goes smoothly, especially Lisa's. On her first day at the San Marco stables, she takes an embarrassing fall, just like a beginner! And that's not the worst of it: The volcanic terrain and tricky footing of the tiny island can be confusing to horses -- and lethal for their riders. Just as Lisa's confidence in her riding plummets to an all-time low, a dangerous mishap will put her horseback skills to the ultimate test... and have her missing her Saddle Club friends like crazy!
