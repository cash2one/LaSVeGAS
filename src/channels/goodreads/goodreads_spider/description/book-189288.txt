As king, it's up to Dante Raintree to protect his clan, but his heart - and maybe his loyalties - may be fatally divided when Lorna Clay walks into his life. Suddenly fire, always his to control, defeats him, taking with it his livelihood. Unsure whether Lorna is to blame yet unable to walk away from her, Dante faces the fight of his lifetime, a fight even his strength and that of the Raintree clan may not be enough to win.
