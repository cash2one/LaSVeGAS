456058:::::Thunder of Heaven:::::The world's worst fears have dawned. Nothing stands in the way of total destruction...except the love of one woman. Deep in the Amazon jungle a young American woman and the son of plantation owners fall madly in love. For Tanya and Shannon, life is a paradise most only dream about. But today paradise ends. The jungle has hatched more than idyllic love. It has also spawned insidious evil. An evil shrouded in a plot so diabolically brilliant that all of America will be brought to her knees at the hands of a few terrorists. The plan is executed to perfection. There is no way out...save an ancient woman whose dark past has lead her to a life of prayer in preparation for the unspeakable terror about to be unleashed.
