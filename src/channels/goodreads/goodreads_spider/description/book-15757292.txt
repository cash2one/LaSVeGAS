15757292:::::Amaranth:::::At thirteen years old Tom and Emily Man had long since given up believing their Grandfathers stories of the magical land of Amaranth. If you were to ask them if they believed in witches, wizards and friendly trolls they'd both say "no . They definitely wouldn t believe in the most terrible and horrifying of all demons, even if he was mentioned in ancient manuscripts in their own world. And if you were to then throw kidnapping, stolen paintings, bloody battles and even a spot of big green romance into the mix and tell them they d be involved in it all, they d begin to think you an idiot, and Emily might even tell you as much. Ironically, as thirteen was the age of magical maturity, it was when they d finally get to visit Amaranth - but they didn't believe. Luckily, getting to Amaranth involves being flung over the edge of a very high and very steep waterfall and believing has absolutely nothing to do with it. You can t help but believe when you re there. When you see it for yourself you believe everything.
