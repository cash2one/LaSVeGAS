25087746:::::The Amazing Journey: True Story of a Father and Son's Odyssey Around the World:::::The Amazing Journey is the true story of Grady and Austin Hicks, a father and son who travel the world for twenty-eight days before Austin attends college. In the spirit of adventure, Grady and Austin s route and activities are kept secret even from family until after the journey. They complete daily, self-imposed Journey Tasks meant to deliberately immerse each into cultural authenticity, and out of their comfort zones. The two intend to experience other cultures and landscapes, but when the journey commences, it becomes clear that these travelers are in store for much more. From foreign militaries to spiritual clairvoyance, from serious illness to unnerving dares, The Amazing Journey reminds us to connect with people be it those closest to you or those across the world to test your limits, and to trust the Journey.
