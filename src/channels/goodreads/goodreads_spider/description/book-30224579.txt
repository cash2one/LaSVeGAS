30224579:::::Unapologetic:::::Our story was bittersweet, sad, happy and hopeful. He was my first everything. I gave him my heart coming in and out of my life whenever it was convenient for him. I gave him my all though he graced the tabloids with different women in his arms. River Ellis was Hollywood s golden bad boy. He rose to fame a few years before me. And now that I m slowly gaining ground in the film industry, he decided it was time to charm me with his godly presence. For two years after he left me, I had built resistance; simply waiting for the day he d come begging me back and I d truly take pleasure in rejecting him. But time and time again, even though I d set my heart and mind into doing one thing, life had a way of testing my will, my endurance.
