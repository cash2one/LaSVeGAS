22820059:::::The Other Man:::::How rough can you take it? LOURDES He was brazen as hell from the moment I laid eyes on him. He was aggressive, and dominant, with Mack truck arms, and a bar brawler voice. He was too good looking for his own good, with a hard jaw, and harder eyes. I d always led a fairly peaceful life, but even I could tell at a glance that this man was dangerous. For so many reasons. Not the least of which being that rough, dirty, sheet-clawing sex fairly radiated off him. I d thought I d known how to handle every kind of man, but this one left me baffled. To say he wasn t my type was putting it lightly. But you couldn t tell that to my libido. Not even when I found out the truth. My lover had lied to me from the very start. Nothing about our meeting was a coincidence. This book can be read as a standalone.
