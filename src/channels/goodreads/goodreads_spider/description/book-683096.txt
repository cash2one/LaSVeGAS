683096:::::My 60 Memorable Games:::::In this book, published by Simon and Schuster in 1969, Bobby Fischer analyzes his most important and representative games. He shows the strategic considerations, the tactics, and sometimes the blunders, that occur during the pressure of tournament play. He assesses his opponents thinking as well. Each game has, in addition to Fischer's own annotations, an analytical introduction by International Grandmaster Larry Evans.
