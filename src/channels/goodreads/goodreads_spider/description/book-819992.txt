819992:::::The Complete Dramatic Works:::::The present volume gathers all of Beckett's texts for theatre, from 1955 to 1984. It includes both the major dramatic works and the short and more compressed texts for the stage and for radio. 'He believes in the cadence, the comma, the bite of word on reality, whatever else he believes; and his devotion to them, he makes clear, is a sufficient focus for the reader's attention. In the modern history of literature he is a unique moral figure, not a dreamer of rose-gardens but a cultivator of what will grow in the waste land, who can make us see the exhilarating design that thorns and yucca share with whatever will grow anywhere.' - Hugh Kenner Contents: Waiting for Godot , Endgame , Happy Days , All That Fall , Acts Without Words , Krapp's Last Tape , Roughs for the Theatre , Embers , Roughs for the Radio , Words and Music , Cascando , Play , Film , The Old Tune , Come and Go , Eh Joe , Breath , Not I , That Time , Footfalls , Ghost Trio,... but the clouds..., A Piece of Monologue , Rockaby , Ohio Impromptu , Quad , Catastrophe , Nacht und Traume , What Where .
