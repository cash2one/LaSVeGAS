28695007:::::The Secret Life of Charlotte Dodd:::::Charlotte Dodd is having a very bad day. After taking an experimental drug to erase her memories of saving the world (or at least the country - several times) Charlotte is given a new life - a quiet, unassuming job, a second chance at love with Luke, and no one trying to kill her. Two years later and with no recollection of saving the world, she steps in to help a random stranger and is amazed at the ease in which she dispatches her opponents using a rolled-up magazine. But how is that possible? She has Buffy-like fight moves, fires a gun with deadly accuracy and can use the air from car tires to keep breathing underwater. When she meets Ham - why is he so familiar? The flashes, the d j vu, the dreams - they re not really dreams? Blowing up a building in Mexico, being buried alive - those things really happened to her? And what is her brother doing flying a plane? Turns out those two years of quiet with Luke was really an undercover mission to help bring down a secret organization targeting her family. Charlotte needs to remember her secret life if she wants to save the world again and the only man she s ever loved.
