5206353:::::What Happened to Suzy:::::Although this story is fiction it is based on fact. The names and locations are changed. It details how one child survived abuse and neglect, how it was manifested in her behaviour and how she learned that it's never too late to heal and to grow personally. In the author's words..."if but one child is saved and put on the road to healing and recovery, then my life will not have been in vain. What happened to Suzy does not have to happen to you!" This is a must-read book, a moving and heartbreaking example of what some children experience in their young lives.
