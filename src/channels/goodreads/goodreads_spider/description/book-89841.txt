89841:::::Cheri and The Last of Cheri:::::Exquisitely handsome, spoilt and sardonic, Ch ri is the only son of a wealthy courtesan, a contemporary of L a, the magnificent and talented woman who for six years has devoted herself to his amorous education. When a rich marriage is arranged for Ch ri, L a reluctantly decides their relationship must end. Ch ri, despite his apparent detachment, is haunted by memories of L a; alienated from his wife, his family and his surroundings, he retreats into a fantasy world made up of dreams and the past, a world from which there is only one route of escape.
