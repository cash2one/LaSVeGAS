12837554:::::While the World Watched: A Birmingham Bombing Survivor Comes of Age During the Civil Rights Movement:::::On September 15, 1963, a Klan-planted bomb went off in the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Alabama. Fourteen-year-old Carolyn Maull was just a few feet away when the bomb exploded, killing four of her friends in the girl s rest room she had just exited. It was one of the seminal moments in the Civil Rights movement, a sad day in American history . . . and the turning point in a young girl s life. While the World Watched is a poignant and gripping eyewitness account of life in the Jim Crow South from the bombings, riots and assassinations to the historic marches and triumphs that characterized the Civil Rights movement. A uniquely moving exploration of how racial relations have evolved over the past 5 decades, While the World Watched is an incredible testament to how far we ve come and how far we have yet to go.
