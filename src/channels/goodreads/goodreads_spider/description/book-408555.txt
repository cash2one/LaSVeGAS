408555:::::Meditations on the Tarot: A Journey into Christian Hermeticism:::::Published for the first time with an index and Cardinal Hans Urs vonBalthasar's afterword, this new English publication of Meditations on theTarot is the landmark edition of one of the most important works of esotericChrist-ianity. Written anonymously and published posthumously, as was theauthor's wish, the intention of this work is for the reader to find a relationshipwith the author in the spiritual dimensions of existence. The author wanted notto be thought of as a personality who lived from 1900 to 1973, but as a friendwho is communicating with us from beyond the boundaries of ordinary life.
