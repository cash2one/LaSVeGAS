8528007:::::The Caine Batter:::::A tale of tragic love in the grunge era of the 90s. Beneath ambiguity, through the screen of a beautifully soundtracked era, hidden amongst loss, brutality and our vices is a tale of the rawest form of love. For a young man that has lost everything, tip-toeing on the suicidal brim of complete &amp; utter defeat. We are shown that love can flourish, lives can change, emotions can peak &amp; that hearts can be saved in a matter of only a few short days.
