1864050:::::Saddle Sore:::::The girls of the Saddle Club--Stevie Lake, Carole Hanson, and Lisa Atwood--and their friend Emily have headed West to the Bar None Dude Ranch. Emily has cerebral palsy. She's helping the ranch's owner make it accessible to riders with special needs. At the ranch, they meet a girl their own age--a former rider who has lost part of her leg in a motorbike accident. She doesn't plan to get on a horse ever again. In the meantime, the Saddle Club and Emily are riding so much, they're saddle sore! Is it possible to have too much of a good thing?
