17825487:::::All My Life:::::Seventeen-year-old Kari meets Neil Mars. Neil as in Armstrong and Mars as in Bruno. A boy who beats every vampire, werewolf, highlander fantasy Kari has ever had. But she knows she can t get close to him. Not ever. Because that would mean telling him everything. Coming clean. And Kari can t bear the idea of changing the way Neil looks at her. Like she s the only girl in the world. His reverence is something too precious to lose. Perhaps even at the cost of losing him. But Kari doesn't know why Neil calls her his Angel and when she finds out, she realizes what love is all about. Boundless joy, unending longing and a fuckload of heartache.
