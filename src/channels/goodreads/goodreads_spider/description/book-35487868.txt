35487868:::::Storm at the Keizer Manor:::::Straight out of high school, Annet moves in with her boyfriend Forrest to escape her mother s multiple and often volatile relationships. She finds a job at the local museum, the Keizer Manor, where the oils from 19th century master painter Alexander Keizer are exhibited. Rapidly working her way up to administrative assistant to the director for collections and exhibitions, she has an important hand in the organization of the Manor s two hundred year anniversary. Although the celebration is a great success, it ends in a quarrel between Annet and Forrest. Talking it over, they stroll through the dunes. When dark clouds roll in, the beautiful sunny weather turns into a thunderstorm so violent that they get separated. The next morning, Forrest finds himself alone. So does Annet. Regaining consciousness in a monastery, Annet is convinced the nuns are playing a prank on her. It can t be the 1800 s! She s a pregnant Twenty-first Century woman and doesn t belong there. But how will she get back to her own time?
