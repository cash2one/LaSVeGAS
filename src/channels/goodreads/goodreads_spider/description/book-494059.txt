494059:::::The DD Group: An Online Investigation Into the Death of Marilyn Monroe:::::From January through October 2003, a group of individuals engaged in an in-depth discussion of the death of one of the 20th century's most beloved figures, Marilyn Monroe. The result is "The DD Group," the highly detailed work of author David Marshall. It chronicles Monroe's final day and her tragic and puzzling demise. Using available information including police reports, vintage magazine and newspaper accounts, documentaries and biographies, and correspondence with some of the principals in the case, the group had one purpose--to reconstruct the events of Monroe's last summer and reach an understanding of what likely took place on August 4, 1962. By verifying sources, considering agendas, and, above all else, applying logic, the DD Group was able to weed through the conflicting and often contradictory reports. Through careful research and study, they arrived at the most comprehensive understanding of the events surrounding Monroe's disturbing death.
