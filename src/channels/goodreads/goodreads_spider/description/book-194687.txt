194687:::::I Have Tampered with the Divine Plan:::::Every once in a great while the glimmer of something different will twinkle from the stack of comic cordwood piled in the daily newspaper. In I Have Tampered with the Divine Plan, the second Agnes collection, that glimmer continues to shine brightly. Agnes, the round-nosed, elegantly footed little girl in the cute black shift, and her best friend, Trout, continue their mad scramble through youth's treacherous minefield. High adventure and mayhem are afoot as they share the odd conversations that cobble together all amazing relationships. And when all that imagination no longer fits in their heads, it spills out into some very messy puddles. And messy puddles are funny. Fans have been eagerly awaiting a second book of Agnes's wisdom and adventure. Agnes appears in many papers across the country, including the San Francisco Examiner, the Chicago Tribune, and the New York Daily News.
