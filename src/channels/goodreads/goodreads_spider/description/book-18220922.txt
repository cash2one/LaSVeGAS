Never was there a love so pure, so perfect, so right. They were living the perfect fairy tale, if only she could see. But that poor girl was only dreaming the perfect dream, for fairy tales are never real. Maggie Harris is ready for a boring summer with her friends. But when you throw the new kid, Evan Mathews, an overprotective older brother, and a series of unsuspected storms into the mix- Maggie's summer will be anything but boring. But one thing is for sure: Anything can happen when it rains in Ocala.
