25973821:::::The Empath, the Warrior & the Wind Rider:::::Meet Cindy, Matt and Phillip Hodges, three teenage siblings who are doing their best to cope with the divorce of their parents. Although they are siblings, they are very different people who are coping with the situation in their own way. Through a strange circular machine with its own personality that appears in the basement of their lake house, they are transported to a different world, a world where magic and science are one. It is also a world where people have wings, can fly, and live in a magnificent, sprawling city floating in the sky. They soon find themselves involved in a religious war, their coming prophesized years ago in the Book of Origins as the Empath, the Warrior and the Wind Rider. With the help of Arion, a teenage sorcerer s apprentice and the beastly yet strangely human Posdingo, they invade the floating city of Fastune to not only set free the Phoenix The Daughter of God and this world s version of Jesus Christ - but to also rid them of the evil Mephosi, a power mad wizard who has declared himself God. As the soldiers of two kingdoms collide in a terrible war they race to set this world back on a peaceful path. But then, a choice must be made. Once it is all over, will they stay here on this wonderful world filled with people they have come to love and consider family or return home to a family that is broken?
