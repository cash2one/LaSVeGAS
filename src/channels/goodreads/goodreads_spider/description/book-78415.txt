78415:::::The Cumbersome Collection:::::Enjoy Lemony Snicket's hilariously gloomy series from the beginning! Full of all the unpleasantness children and adults have come to love, The Cumbersome Collection includes the first 11 books of the wildly popular A Series of Unfortunate Events. As always, be forewarned that there is nothing to be found in this series but "misery, despair, and discomfort." Read at your own risk.
