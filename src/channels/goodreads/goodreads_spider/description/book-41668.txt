41668:::::My Side of the Mountain Trilogy:::::In 1959, Jean Craighead George published My Side of the Mountain . This coming-of-age story about a boy and his falcon went on to win a Newbery Honor, and for the past forty years has enthralled and entertained generations of would-be Sam Gribleys. The two books that followed-- On the Far Side of the Mountain and Frightful's Mountain --were equally extraordinary. Now all three books are available in one deluxe yet affordable volume for veteran devotees and brand-new fans alike.
