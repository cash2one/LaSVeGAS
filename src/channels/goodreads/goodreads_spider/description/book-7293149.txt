7293149:::::Cursed Blessing:::::Shrouded in secrecy, the Ark of the Endowment has remained hidden for millennia. Those fortunate enough to know of its location have but one task: to keep its contents from being stolen. Like Pandora's Box, the legend says that anyone who partakes of its sacred contents will invoke divine judgment upon the world. But who is to say that it cannot be used for good? Who could resist the temptation of its promise: eternal youth? Brent Venturi owns and operates a library in Palm Cove, Florida, that has been in his family for generations. But unknown to most, his simple life and dedication to structure have been engrained in him by a career of elite military service. As the retired captain of a group known only as the Phantom Squad, he has no history or records on file, and he remains the property of the United States Government. His rigidity and devotion have cost him dearly; his service has left psychological and physical scars, and he is emotionally distant. When the heirlooms of a man he hardly knew show up unannounced in his office, his everyday routine is shattered. Cursed Blessing is a rollercoaster thriller that will keep you guessing at every turn. Each revelation leads to more questions, cryptic warnings, secret maps, and shady allies. When the last guardian of the world's most important secret is dead, who can be trusted?
