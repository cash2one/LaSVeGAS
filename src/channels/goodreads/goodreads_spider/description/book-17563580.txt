17563580:::::Haunted House:::::HAUNTED HOUSE is a sequel to the novels AFRAID, TRAPPED, and ENDURANCE. The survivors from those thrillers are all together, and put through a new kind of hell. Also included is Dr. Frank Belgium, from ORIGIN. All characters have back stories. In the case of HAUNTED HOUSE, these back stories exist in other books. While HAUNTED HOUSE can be read as a stand alone, and may be the first Kilborn book read by a lot of people, if a reader enjoys it, he/she can read more about these characters in different novels. And fans of these other novels will enjoy seeing familiar characters show up again in a new novel. - from J.A. Konrath's Blog "A Newbies Guide to Publishing".
