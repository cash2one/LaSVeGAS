25861945:::::This Is the Story of You:::::On Haven, a six-mile long, half-mile-wide stretch of barrier island, Mira Banul and her Year-Rounder friends have proudly risen to every challenge. But when a superstorm defies all predictions and devastates the island, when it strands Mira s mother and brother on the mainland and upends all logic, nothing will ever be as it was. A stranger appears in the wreck of Mira s home. A friend obsessed with vanishing is gone. As the mysteries deepen, Mira must find the strength to carry on to somehow hold her memories in place while learning to trust a radically reinvented future. Gripping and poetic, This Is the Story of You is about the beauty of nature and the power of family, about finding hope in the wake of tragedy and recovery in the face of overwhelming loss.
