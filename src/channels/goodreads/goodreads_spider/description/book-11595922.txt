11595922:::::The Consumerist Manifesto Handbook: The Guerilla's Guide to Making Corporations Pay for Faulty Goods, Substandard Services, and Broken Promises:::::Consumers: rise up and demand your rights! This funny, irreverent, and informative guide exposes the many abuses committed by corporations against the modern consumer, urging readers to shake off the fog of learned helplessness and demand their money's worth from every transaction. Anti-corporate guerilla Charles Selden draws on his 40-plus years of experience revealing the extraordinary (and often hilarious) lengths to which companies will go to duck their responsibilities to consumers. Best of all, he shows how to recognize the signs of such customer disservice and capitalize on them, clearly outlining the tactics customers need to master in order to get what they paid for, every single time.
