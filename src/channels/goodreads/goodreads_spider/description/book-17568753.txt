17568753:::::Vatican Waltz:::::This book is for those who want a journey of the soul. What were your feelings about God, the Divine, your own soul when you were growing up? Did you go to the church of your parents? Being in that building, where your family said their prayers, did it inspire you also? This book is about a young girl growing up with the gift of being a mystic. Sometimes, no words are needed to reach the heart of Divine love. Silence is the fare for admission to the land where you encounter the God/Goddess. This young girl grows up with the gift of contemplative prayer. She shares her prayer life with Her parish priest, who sees before him a future saint in the making. She receives messages from the Divine voice &amp; visions that the Catholic Church in America is dying. Little or no vocations to the Priesthood. Her visions tell Her its time for Women to become Priests, like in the times of the Apostles. This voice is so strong that Her parish priest writes to an archbishop, who is willing to see Her. This archbishop doesn't share Her vision for the catholic Church, for Women have been banned for centuries. But he sees that this young Woman is special. He can't put his finger on it though. So, He asks someone higher up, in the holy city of Rome, the Vatican, to see Her. And off goes this young, innocent Woman, on a plane for the 1st time. But before She lands in Rome, a group of people knows She coming, and why. Would you have the faith, the trust in your soul, to obey the Divine voice &amp; visions? This is an unexpected journey, full of excitement, danger &amp; perhaps a change in the wind. Take this trip of the spirit. It could one day be yours to make also.
