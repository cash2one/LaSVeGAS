355406:::::Tomorrow's God: Our Greatest Spiritual Challenge:::::From the New York Times bestselling author of The New Revelations and Conversations with God comes a galvanizing vision of spirituality unlike anything you've experienced before.... Humanity is about to create a new form of spirituality on earth. Neale Donald Walsch believes that this New Spirituality will allow humans to express their natural impulse toward the Divine without making one another wrong for the way in which they are doing it...and without killing each other in the name of it. In Tomorrow's God, Walsch offers compelling reasons why adopting this new belief system is in the best interests of humankind -- now. Tomorrow's God contains an astonishing prediction, one that comes from an astonishing source: God. Presented as a conversation between God and Walsch, this startling, profound book is offered in two parts: Part One deals with humanity's current conception of God, and the new ideas about the Deity that will characterize God in our not-too-distant future. Part Two examines how these ideals will be put into place -- and how they will impact our lives, and help us to create a newer, better world. Controversial, challenging, and illuminating, Tomorrow's God provides both spiritual and down-to-earth advice on what each of us can do to cope with the current world crises -- and experience God in such a way that ourexperience of one another will be healed at last.
