190054:::::True Meditation:::::What would happen if you were to allow everything to be exactly as it is? If you gave up the need for control, and instead embraced the whole of your experience in each moment that arose? In the fourteen years that he studied Zen, Adyashanti found that most seasoned meditators had used the practice as a means to a goal they never reached. What he ultimately realized: that only when you let go of all techniques?even the concept of yourself as a meditator?will you open to the art of true meditation: dwelling in the natural state. True Meditation invites you to join the growing number of seekers who have been touched by the wisdom of Adyashanti to learn: ? How to make the "effortless effort" that will vivify the present moment ? Meditative self-inquiry and "The Way of Subtraction": how to ask a spiritually powerful question?and determine the real answer ? Three guided meditations on CD intended to reveal what Adyashanti calls "your home as awareness itself " "We?ve been taught that awakening is difficult," explains Adyashanti, "that to wake up from the illusion of separation takes years. But all it really takes is a willingness to look into the depths of your experience here and now." True Meditation gives you the opportunity to reclaim the original purpose of meditation? as a gateway to "the objectless freedom of being."
