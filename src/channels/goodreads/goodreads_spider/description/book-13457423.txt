13457423:::::Highlander Most Wanted:::::In Highlander Most Wanted, a reclusive woman content to live in the shadows shows a Highland warrior the true meaning of love. Genevieve McInnes is locked behind the fortified walls of McHugh Keep, captive of a cruel laird who takes great pleasure in ruining her for any other man. Yet when Bowen Montgomery storms the gates on a mission of clan warfare, Genevieve finds that her spirit is bent but not broken. Still, her path toward freedom remains uncertain. Unable to bear the shame of returning to a family that believes her dead or to abandon others at the keep to an imposing new laird, Genevieve opts for the peaceful life of an abbess. But Bowen s rugged sensuality stirs something deep inside her that longs to be awakened by his patient, gentle caress something warm, wicked, and tempting. Bowen seizes his enemy s keep, unprepared for the brooding and reclusive woman who captures his heart. He s enchanted by her fierce determination, her unusual beauty, and her quiet, unfailing strength. But wooing her will take more than a seasoned seducer s skill. For loving Genevieve, he discovers, means giving her back the freedom that was stolen from her even if it means losing her forever.
