54042:::::Malone Dies:::::Written and published in French in 1951, and in Samuel Beckett s English translation in 1956, Malone Dies is the second of his immediate post-war novels, written during what Beckett later referred to as the siege in the room . Malone , writes Malone, is what I am called now. On his deathbed, whittling away the time with stories and revisions of stories, the octogenarian Malone's account of his condition is contradictory and intermittent, shifting with the vagaries of the passing days: without mellowness, without elegiacs; wittier, jauntier, and capable of darker rages than his precursor Molloy. Malone promises silence, but as a storyteller he delivers irresistibly more.
