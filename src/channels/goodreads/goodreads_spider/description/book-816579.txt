816579:::::From This Moment On:::::In this sweeping, emotional love story, Lynn Kurland takes us back to the thirteenth century--and all the passion and magnificence of medieval England... Colin of Berkhamshire knows two things--the pleasures of warring and that brides do not want him. Two years ago his bride-to-be, Alienore, fled and hasn't been seen since. Yet his father keeps foisting prospects on him. The latest seems to do nothing but faint. Alienore of Solonge knows two things as well--that fleeing not only Colin but also her scheming stepmother was the right thing to do. Yet as a knight in disguise she constantly fears discovery. At this point, she's not sure whom she fears more, the Butcher of Berkhamshire or her evil stepmother. Through a bizarre twist of fate, she ends up journeying with her charge--Colin's latest intended--to England, where Alienore finds herself not only in the Butcher of Berkhamshire's garrison, but being made over into a knight by him personally. She thinks her life cannot worsen. Until she begins to fall in love with him...
