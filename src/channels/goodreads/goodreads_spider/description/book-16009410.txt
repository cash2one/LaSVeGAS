16009410:::::Zoe, Undead:::::A new disease has struck worldwide, one that attacks and reprograms the brain, kills and controls the body, and reduces the less than living victim to a killing/eating machine. With more than seventy-five percent of the world's population either dead or infected, only a few pockets of resistance remain. The remnants of militaries have banded together with a few volunteers to form Zombie Response Teams to fight back and prevent the extinction of mankind, but they are losing the war. One family will fight to protect their autistic daughter from the horror of the wandering zombie mobs. They fail. Now, Zoe unwittingly holds the key to mankind's survival, to winning the war, and only she can walk in the two worlds of the living and the undead.
