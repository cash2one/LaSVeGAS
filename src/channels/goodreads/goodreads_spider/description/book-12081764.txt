12081764:::::Becoming:::::**Optioned for movie rights by multiple-award winning producer Chase Chenowith of Back Fence Productions.** Every three years, Amber Hopkins explodes. Okay, not a blown-to-smithereens explosion, but whatever it is always hurts like hell and leaves her life a shambles. She s already worked her way through five foster placements, and she s doing whatever she can to avoid getting blasted into a sixth. As her eighteenth birthday approaches and she feels the strange and powerful energy building, disaster looms. When the inevitable explosion occurs, her life gets its biggest shakeup yet. She ll not only learn how her fellow foster and best friend, Gabriel, really feels about her, but she ll discover that she isn t really without family. To top it all off, she ll finally find out why she s having the power surges: she isn t entirely human. Amber must Become, transitioning to another plane of existence and risking the loss of the most important relationship she s ever had. Her choice will impact the future of an entire race of beings, and will pit her against an enemy that will prey upon her doubt to try and take her very life. Kind of makes the explosions now seem like a cakewalk.
