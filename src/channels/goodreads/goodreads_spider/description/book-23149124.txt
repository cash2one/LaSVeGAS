23149124:::::Raine:::::Warning: RAINE contains adult situations some readers may find offensive. This is a deeply emotional story that contains violence, explicit sex, strong language, and is not considered suitable for readers under 18. Shy. Intelligent. Naive. Statistic. Raine Forester was an average girl leading an average life. She slipped beneath everyone's radar, until Camron Moss, the most popular guy in school, took interest in her and changed everything. Some acts are unforgivable. Raine thought she'd been accepted. She thought she was one of them. She thought she was in love... until one moment made her realize she'd trusted the wrong person. Lies are told, hearts get broken, secrets are revealed, and sometimes, true love is found in the least likely places.
