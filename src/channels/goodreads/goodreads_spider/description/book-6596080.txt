6596080:::::Taming Kate:::::It's going to take a lot more than sweet talk to tame this Kate... Kate has given up on men. They're all unreliable gold-diggers or worse. Besides, who needs men when she has her work? Unfortunately Daddy has other plans. He wants to see her happy, and he knows just the man for the job. Enter Peter Manning, the incredibly sexy horse-whisperer, whose healing skills work on more than just horses. He's got all the right tools for taming this wild filly - rope, blindfolds, his bare hands. Kate's acid tongue and prickly manner are no match for Peter's strength and determination. And pretty soon, their battle of wills leads them into each others' arms... and beds. Publisher's note: This book was previously released at Loose Id.
