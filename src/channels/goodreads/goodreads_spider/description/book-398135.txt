398135:::::Hunting Midnight:::::For hundreds of years, a pack of shape-shifting immortals has been content to stay hidden deep within the Scottish wood, far from the dangers of the human world. But when the pack leader, Ulric, is betrayed by his longtime lover, he recklessly ventures beyond the borders of the forest, and starts roaming the streets of Bridesmere. It is there that he encounters Juliana Buxton, a dutiful daughter of a successful merchant. Ulric finds Juliana's wholesomeness deliciously irresistible, and consents to help her escape the clutches of her much older betrothed--if only to seduce her. For Juliana, Ulric's gentle fury inflames her desire and finally introduces her to the wickedly sensuous delights of searing passion. And as she begins to uncover the truth about his secret identity, something altogether new grows within in her--a forbidden longing to become immortal herself and remain by Ulric's side. But will Ulric grant the innocent maiden her bold wish, or will he cast her from his life and send her back to the treacherous world beyond the caves? "Fans of bolder romances will relish [Emma Holly's] potent combination of heady sexuality and intriguing characterization."-- Publishers Weekly "Emma Holly is one of the best writers of erotic fiction around."--Susan Johnson
