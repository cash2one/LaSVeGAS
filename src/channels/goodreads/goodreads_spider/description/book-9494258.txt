9494258:::::After the Fall:::::When the world ends, what s left to care about? Taylor Stone is no hero. She has three simple rules for life after the plague: Keep moving. Keep to yourself. Don t get involved. The plague took a particular joy in killing the women of the world, making it that much harder for the few who survived. The only thing that matters since she escaped from a small farm outside of Pittsburgh is the truth waiting at the end of her journey home. The rest of the world, or what s left of it, can go straight to Hell as far as she s concerned. When a group of survivors offers her food and shelter, she is more than happy to spend a few days, take what she needs, and get out, like she always does. But in a place called Burninghead Farm, despite all her rules and plans, Taylor finds a group of people who have more to offer than the basics of survival. Most of all, there is Kate, a woman who makes Taylor realize love is still alive and makes her dream of a future she thought was no longer possible. If only Taylor can find the courage to fight for it. It turns out that the end of the world isn t about the end of the world at all, but about what happens after.
