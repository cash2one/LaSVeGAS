7044445:::::Bonds of Justice:::::Max Shannon is a good cop, one of the best in New York Enforcement. Born with a natural shield that protects him against Psy mental invasions, he knows he has little chance of advancement within the Psy-dominated power structure. The last case he expects to be assigned is that of a murderer targeting a Psy Councilor s closest advisors. And the last woman he expects to compel him in the most sensual of ways is a Psy on the verge of a catastrophic mental fracture Sophia Russo is a Justice-Psy, cursed with the ability to retrieve memories from men and women so twisted even veteran cops keep their distance.

But, her mind filled with other people s nightmares, other people s evil, she s standing on the border between sanity and a silken darkness that urges her to take justice into her own hands, to become judge, jury and executioner
