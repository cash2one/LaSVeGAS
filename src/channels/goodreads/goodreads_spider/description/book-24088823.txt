To help him live. Topher She wasn t on my agenda; it was fate s cruel way of telling me I needed to get my shit together. To be fair, my head was so far up my ass, I m not sure how we extracted it. I knew the power I held over my peers, I exuded it daily. I could have any girl I wanted at the snap of my fingers, and yet I found myself fantasizing about her-someone so far off my radar it wasn t even funny. She helped me understand that sometimes you need to let go to really live. Sometimes being alive means taking risks. Learning to Live is the first book in the Infinite Love series.
