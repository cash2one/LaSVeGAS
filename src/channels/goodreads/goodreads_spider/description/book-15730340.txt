15730340:::::The Firebird:::::Whoever dares to seek the Firebird may find the journey and its ending unexpected. Nicola Marter was born with a gift. When she touches an object, she sometimes sees images; glimpses of those who have owned it before. It s never been a gift she wants, and she keeps it a secret from most people, including her practical boss Sebastian, one of London s premier dealers in Russian art. But when a woman offers Sebastian a small wooden carving for sale, claiming it belonged to Russia s first Empress Catherine, it s a problem. There s no proof. Sebastian believes that the plain carving known as The Firebird is worthless. But Nicola s held it, and she knows the woman is telling the truth, and is in desperate need of the money the sale of the heirloom could bring. Compelled to help, Nicola turns to a man she once left, and still loves: Rob McMorran, whose own psychic gifts are far greater than hers. With Rob to help her see the past, she follows a young girl named Anna from Scotland to Belgium and on into Russia. There, in St. Petersburg the once-glittering capital of Peter the Great s Russia Nicola and Rob unearth a tale of love and sacrifice, of courage and redemption an old story that seems personal and small, perhaps, against the greater backdrops of the Jacobite and Russian courts, but one that will forever change their lives.
