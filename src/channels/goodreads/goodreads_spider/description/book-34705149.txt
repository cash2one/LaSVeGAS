34705149:::::Swink:::::I m that guy. Camilla Landry rustles against me, the silky fabric of her overpriced lingerie slipping along my bruised rib. The porcelain perfection of her skin is even more innocent against the colorful ink dotting my own. It s demure meets damaged, pampered meets punctured. So, yeah, it s obvious I m that guy. Dominic Hughes. Her attempt at rebellion. Her bid to see what the other side of the tracks feel like. I m okay with being used because, from where I m sitting, the other side of the tracks have never looked so good.
