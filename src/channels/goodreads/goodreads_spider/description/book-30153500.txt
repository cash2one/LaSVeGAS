30153500:::::A Three Course Meal for the Mind:::::A Three Course Meal for the Mind combines three books into a single volume: 'On The Other Hand', 'Just Around The Bend' and 'Louder Than a Whisper' (also available separately). The books chronical Ren e Paule s philosophical journey of self-reflection. She questions many facets of life that we take for granted, unlearning all that she has been taught: thus freeing her mind from the conditioning that society imprints. There is much to think about in these pages and it can make for uncomfortable reading as questions we tend to avoid are raised and discussed, particularly in On The Other Hand . This collection is self-help in the truest sense as there are no answers provided and it is left to the reader to cogitate and draw their own conclusions - conclusions that Ren e maintains we already know but shy away from. One thing that stands out in all three books is that 'we' are responsible for what happens in our world: there is no-one else to blame. You may not like what you read herein but you will be hard-pressed to refute it. The second two books are illustrated with lovely line drawings that demonstrate some of Humanity s much treasured and endearing qualities. G R Hewitt (Editor)
