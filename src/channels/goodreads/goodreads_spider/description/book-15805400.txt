15805400:::::The Man at the Door:::::The man at the door carries a vital message for the King of Caelius, but he is mortally wounded and near death when he knocks at Elspeth's door. The young woman, living alone in a ramshackle house, at the edge of starvation is stunned by the arrival and death of the messenger. Abandoned by her abusive father and left to care for her sickly mother until her death, she struggles to survive both physically and emotionally and fantasizes about rescue by the young Prince of Caelius to ease her misery. Seizing the opportunity to chase her fantasy, she sets out on the man s horse to deliver the message herself. Arriving at the castle, Elspeth delivers the message to King Fredric, who warmly welcomes her, offering her acceptance and love. But trusting his response is a difficult venture: she must reconcile it with her lowly, abusive past, while facing her fears, and embracing the longings she has denied for a lifetime. Struggling with her inability to trust, she makes an astounding discovery and comes face-to-face with the depth of the King s love.
