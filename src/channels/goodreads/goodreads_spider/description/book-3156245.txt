3156245:::::The Mighty Book of Boosh:::::Join Howard Moon, Vince Noir, Naboo, Bollo, Bob Fossil, Old Gregg, the Moon, and all your other favorite characters on a unique and graphically stunning journey into the world of The Mighty Boosh Incredibly funny, visually dynamic, surreal, musical, and wildly creative, The Mighty Boosh is unlike anything else on television, and this beautifully illustrated humor book promises to be the same. Boosh art director Dave Brown aka Bollo the gorilla has designed countless graphics based on Boosh jokes, including a poster for the Howard vs. kangaroo boxing match and a vintage Penguin-looking book cover for Howard Moon's Trumpet Full of Memories . Other artists have illustrated such essentials of the Boosh- iverse as the a cappella songs known as crimps and the eclectic hairstyles. Every Boosh fan will love Old Gregg's Baileys-fueled watercolors, Vince's Excuses for Being Late, and Bob Fossil's Guide to Dance.
