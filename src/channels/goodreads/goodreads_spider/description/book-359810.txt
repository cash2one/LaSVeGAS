359810:::::The Deadly Hunter:::::Nobody knows her name. Nobody knows when she will strike. All they know is that she is a deadly bounty hunter--and her latest mission has taken her to Coruscant, home of the Jedi. Her target: an old friend of Qui-Gon Jinn's. Qui-Gon and his apprentice, Obi-Wan Kenobi, make an attempt to catch her...and fail. Now they are her targets, too.
