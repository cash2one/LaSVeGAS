13454:::::How To Think Like Leonardo Da Vinci: Seven Steps To Every Day Genius:::::Here's a personal growth guidebook that's won the admiration and recommendation of Ted Hughes, Poet Laureate of England. He calls this "a brilliant, practical guide to awakening and training our vast, unused resources of intelligence and ability." Author Michael Gelb, founder of High Performance Learning and consultant for companies including AT&amp;T and National Public Radio, says that we all can unlock the "da Vincian" genius inside us. Gelb says there are seven critical principles that need to be followed for success, whether you're learning a new language, studying to be a gourmet chef, or just hoping to be more effective on the job: Curiosita : An insatiably curious approach to life. Dimonstratzione : A commitment to test knowledge through experience. Sensazione : The continual refinement of the senses, especially sight, as the means to clarify experience. Sfumato : A willingness to embrace ambiguity, paradox, and uncertainty. Arte/Scienza : The development of the balance between science and art, logic and imagination ("whole-brain thinking"). Corporalita : The cultivation of ambidexterity, fitness, and poise. Connessione : A recognition and appreciation for the connectedness of all things and phenomena; "systems thinking." Gelb discusses each of these principles in relation to what da Vinci accomplished, thereby giving this book a built-in history lesson. The illustrations from the master's work and time add a nice warmth to the work. As the president of NPR said after working with Gelb, this is a program recommended for "anyone who wants to experience a personal and professional Renaissance."
