9439936:::::In the Company of Angels:::::Imprisoned and tortured for months by Pinochet's henchmen for teaching political poetry to his students, Bernardo Greene is visited by two angels who promise him that he will survive to experience beauty and love once again. Months later, in Copenhagen, the Chilean exile befriends Michela Ibsen, herself a survivor of domestic abuse. In the long nights of summer, the two of them struggle to heal, to forgive those who have left them damaged, and to trust themselves to love. Dense with wisdom and humanity, In the Company of Angels is a powerful testament to the resilience and complexity of the human heart. Praise for In the Company of Angels : "Wide-ranging and assured."- New Yorker "If its stellar quality is any indication, the entire [Copenhagen Quartet] promises to be an exceptional reading experience Kennedy [has a] fertile imagination and all-embracing empathy."- Booklist (starred review) "As elegant as it is beautiful, as important as it is profound. A marvel of aread." - Junot D az, author of The Brief Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao "In the Company of Angels is a novel about grown-ups, people battered and dinged by life, painfully aware of their own responsibility, whose understanding of their past never stops evolving. It's the dignity of their adulthood-the elusive prize at stake in any midlife crisis-that makes them so admirable and, above all, so moving."- Laura Miller, Salon
