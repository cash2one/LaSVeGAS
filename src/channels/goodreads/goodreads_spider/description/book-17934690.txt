17934690:::::Girls with Swords: How to Carry Your Cross Like a Hero:::::If you don t have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one! Jesus What if you discovered you have been entrusted with an invisible, invincible, and incorruptible weapon? Would you use it? Would you move beyond only study and begin to wield the Word of God! If there ever was a time for women to be armed, it s now. Worldwide, women are the targets of prejudice, sex trafficking, abuse, and even gendercide. Lisa Bevere writes that these attacks say more about who women might be in the future than who they have been in the past. In Girls with Swords she explains how the enemy is seeking to disarm women on every level. It s time women become the heroes God created them to be and stand courageous, discerning, forgiving, and wise. Take up your sword and be a hero! In Girls with Swords you will be challenged to join the ranks of Christians who are already moving forward in their faith. Don t be taken out of the fight! Stand firm and experience spiritual victory. Pastor Steven and Holly Furtick, Elevation Church, Charlotte, NC Lisa Bevere is one of God s most powerful voices for this time in our history. Sheila Walsh, core speaker for Women of Faith
