718804:::::Show Jumper:::::The Saddle Club is going to the horse show! So is Veronica diAngelo, and she is already deciding where to display her next blue ribbon. But she may be in for a shock. The Saddle Club has a secret weapon: Samson, the natural born jumper. He and Lisa Atwood could steal the show.As Lisa competes, she realizes that Samson is even better than they thought -- and a lot better than she is. And the other riders are mean-spirited and seem to think that winning means destroying the competition, not just doing your best. Do Lisa and Samson have the right stuff to take the blue? Or will they have to settle for less than their best?
