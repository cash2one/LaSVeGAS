359757:::::Dangerous Depths:::::Sometimes life's most precious treasure lies at Dangerous Depths. Leia ditched a promising medical career to settle on a secluded island of Hawaii. She ditched Bane, too, and he's come to the island to find out why. He's also in search of a fortune rumored to lie offshore. But an act of sabotage that pushes Bane closer to Leia plunges them both into a tangle of emotion--just as a series of threatening events grip the island. Theft, a friend's death, a bizarre intruder, hints of a second treasure...and even murder--how can they sort it all out when everyone on the island has something to hide? The novels in Colleen Coble's popular Aloha Reef Series combine mystery and suspense with tender romance in an irresistible island setting.
