2192348:::::Blood Wish:::::I wish I may. Eight-year-old Evan Murphy has just lost his father to cancer. His grief-stricken mother has uprooted him from the only life he s ever known to move him to the small mountain town where she grew up. All he knows of the dark forest surrounding his new home are the fanciful stories from his mother s youth about a hidden well that grants any wish. I wish I might. There are other children in the woods, children who stalk him from the shadows and stand beneath his window at night. Children with severed arms tied off with bloody burlap, their mouths wired shut by rusted lengths of wire to forever hold the secrets they would share. Live to see another night. Something even more evil hides in the darkest reaches of the forest, wishing for Evan. Wishing for blood. Hardcover Chapbook #4
