Despite the odd looks and off-color comments about her off-color hair, life is good.

Too bad she hasn t a clue that Colt s been head-over-bootheels in love with her from day one. After an unexpected, steamy interlude, all India can think about is riding the sexy cowboy instead of her motorcycle, even when Colt is determined to show her a slower ride is worth the wait. Or are they risking their friendship for a fling that could burn them both?"
