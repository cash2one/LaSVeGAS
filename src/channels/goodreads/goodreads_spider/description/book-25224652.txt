25224652:::::Taking Flight:::::Seventeen-year-old Lauren Lennox is a city girl at heart. Being born and raised in Los Angeles, California by her movie star mom and ex-child-star father sounds like an ideal childhood, but with a mother who s always busy and a father who suffers from alcoholism, Lauren s already parentless childhood and her resulting rebellious streak are made worse when her mother passes away and she s left alone with her father, who doesn t care how little school she attends, how much alcohol she drinks, or how many girls she sleeps with. When she puts too many toes out of line and a judge deems her father unfit to be her guardian, she s shipped across the country to the rural mountains of northern Georgia, where a personal friend of the judge lives with his wife and two kids on a farm. David Marshall is a professional counselor known for reforming unruly youth , and as part of David s program, Lauren will be required to work with farm animals, go to church once a week, attend counseling sessions with David, and go to a new school, all for seven months until her graduation. So naturally, her plan is simple: to have her best friend come pick her up two months early on the day she turns eighteen, and to be as difficult as possible in the meantime. Her plan doesn t account for David Marshall s daughter.
