18625450:::::Knights' Sinner:::::Jackson is always considered the 'softie'. He's the first to help people out when they're in need. He's President of the Hell's Knights and he figures it's about time he shows the world how much of a sinner he can be. Serenity has a dark past. Secrets haunt her and she has no way of escaping them. Hogan is the only family she knows and life with him is brutal. And it's about to get worse. He sends her on a mission. On a mission to destroy the Hell's Knights and the Heaven's Sinners. Can she pretend with a club she doesn't know? Or will she betray Hogan for the man she's falling in love with?
