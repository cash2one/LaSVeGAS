17354744:::::Instruction Manual for the 21st Century Samurai:::::Who hasn t considered, at some point in their life, what it would take to live as a samurai? Whether it was a serious, life-long obsession or a passing, whimsical thought; in either case, there was really no way to know how to go about living life as a samurai. Any book about the samurai, or their codes, was either so strictly historical, or so thickly academic, that it didn t give any practical solutions to the average person, about how to go about applying the samurai ethic to their daily life. Previously, the aspiring samurai had no resource at all. But now, they have the manual. Based on the ancient and authoritative texts of three samurai masters, this manual gives the direct and authentic samurai solution to any of life s many situations. This pocket-sized book can be carried anywhere, anytime, for quick reference. No matter where life takes you, you are just one quick reference away from the "samurai solution" to your problems. Men, women and children, from all walks of life; No matter who you are or what circumstances life throws your way--with this manual, you, too, can live like a samurai!
