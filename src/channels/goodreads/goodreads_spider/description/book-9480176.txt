9480176:::::Hot Shot:::::Free from Rainbow eBooks. Paul, a photographer, is roomies with Carlo. He's been crushing on Carlo for years but Carlo goes through men like kleenex. After running home in the rain from dinner out, Carlo suddenly asks Paul to photograph him. Paul is getting turned on and Carlo is working it in his wet t-shirt and then taking it off until he finally tells Paul outright that he wants him. It's just a little friends-to-lovers interlude that was quite sexy and also sweet as Paul can't believe Carlo really wants him.
