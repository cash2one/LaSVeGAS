31080449:::::The Pirate:::::A contemporary of Charles Dickens, Captain Frederick Marryat was an officer in the Royal British Navy who, also a novelist, certainly followed the old line about writing what you know. The result is an accessible, deeply immersive, high-seas adventure full of chases, battles, baddies getting their comeuppance, the proven loyalty of friends, romance, and reunions. Fair warning that this is a novel of its time, using slurs against and references to captive slaves out of Africa we would not tolerate today.
