6083312:::::Angel Warriors:::::When Abdiel refused to side with Lucifer in his failed revolt to take over Heaven, his own family cut him down like a dog and left him for dead. Ever since then, Abdiel has become a withdrawn shell of what he used to be and separated himself from all other angels. That is until the Chief of Archangels, Michael, comes and interrupts his perfectly miserable life by ordering him to Earth to head up an angel warrior team. An angel warrior team that consists of a smart-mouthed punk empath and a blast from the past, a healer named Gabi. Gabi spent her entire childhood harboring a secret love for Abdiel. He, in turn, never knew she existed. Now that she s a full-grown female she told herself that she was over the dark brooding male. Then he shows up at her door and she realizes that her feelings have never gone away--if anything they ve gotten stronger. But love is the last thing that she should be thinking of now--they have a city in danger, an ancient prophesy that is coming into play, and a whole horde of demons coming for their hides.
