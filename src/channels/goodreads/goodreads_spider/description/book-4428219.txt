4428219:::::James:::::Award-winning cartoonist Mark Tonra uniquely interprets the quintessential tug-of-war we call "childhood," where innocence confronts experience, right debates wrong, and halfhearted independence challenges a loving lap to sit on. Buffered by his own wide-eyed resilience, James collides daily with life's most poignant and comic truths-exhibiting a bravado (both real and false) that is at once endearing and universally human. With a deceptively simple palette, Mark Tonra skillfully paints a detailed portrait of every reader's experience. Wit and wisdom are on full display as James marches through life with his offbeat -and equally adorable-cohorts. is a rare combination of heart and razor-sharp humor that has comic fans of all ages shouting for more!"
