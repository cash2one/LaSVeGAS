23278280:::::Off the Page:::::From #1 New York Times bestselling authors Jodi Picoult and Samantha van Leer, OFF THE PAGE is a tender and appealing YA novel filled with romance, humor, and adventure. Delilah and Oliver shouldn t be together. But they are together. And just as they re getting used to the possibility that happily ever after may really, truly be theirs, the universe sends them a message they can t ignore: they won t be allowed to rewrite their story. Delilah and Oliver must decide how much they re willing to risk for love and what it takes to have a happy ending in a world where the greatest adventures happen off the page. Off the Page is just so sweet and magical. In high school, I would have given ANYTHING to crawl inside one of my favorite books to escape the real world. I wish! SARAH DESSEN, #1 New York Times bestselling author of Saint Anything
