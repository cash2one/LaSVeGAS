13449244:::::That Touch of Magic:::::Stacy Easter has seen better days. Being a librarian is a labor of love if only paying her bills were half as much fun. What s a single, bookish beauty in sleepy Nodaway Falls, New York, supposed to do? To make ends meet, Stacy decides to develop her special powers. Everyone can use a touch of magic now and then, right? Soon she s got clients lining up to receive her signature potions until a few of them go awry. Meanwhile, her own life has just taken a storybook turn: Leo North, the official One Who Got Away, is back in town. Stacy s best friends, Peach and Liv, are more concerned about the state of her heart than the side effects of a few rogue magic spells. But someone with dark intentions is crossing magical wires all over Nodaway Falls, and those closest to Stacy are at risk. Can Stacy conjure up a way out of this mess with her life and maybe even her love life intact?
