43574:::::Ice Haven:::::Welcome to Ice Haven! It s not as cold here as it sounds, declares Random Wilder, our reluctant guide to this sleepy Midwestern town. He s also its would-be poet laureate. Would-be, that is, were it not for the florid banalities of his archrival, Ida Wentz, pub lished ad nauseam in the Ice Haven Daily Progress. Among Wilder s other fellow Ice Havians are the love lorn Violet Vanderplazt and Vida Wentz; the adorable interracial moppets Carmichael and Paula; the Blue Bunny, newly sprung from prison and the bitterest rabbit in town; and poor little David Goldberg, miss ing for more than a week now. . . . The lives of the men and women of Ice Haven are woven into a multilayered tale that, while it owes a debt to Our Town, is ultimately based on and inspired by . . . Leopold and Loeb. No kidding. Only Daniel Clowes could do it and, luckily for us, he has.
