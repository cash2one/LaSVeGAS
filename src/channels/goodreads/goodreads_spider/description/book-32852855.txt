32852855:::::Un-Dead:::::This short story takes place the first October 31st after Chameleon Moon, Book 1. Parole's devastating collapse left overwhelming damage, and a lot of dead. As the city's de facto leader, Evelyn Calliope does her best every day to hold everyone together, including herself. Now the sweet but sometimes-eerie Jenny Strings says she can speak to the deceased - and someone very important wants to talk to Evelyn. Unfortunately, where Jenny offers treats, Hans is up to his usual tricks. This ex-'ghost' has a brand-new body, and he's having way too much fun stretching his legs to let someone take his place as the Emerald Bar's resident poltergeist. Some secrets are meant to be kept. Some are meant to be shared. And some should just stay buried. Happy Halloween!
