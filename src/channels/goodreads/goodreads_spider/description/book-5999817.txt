5999817:::::And Then Everything Unraveled:::::First there was a disappearance. Then there was a clue. Then there was a kiss. And then... Delia Truesdale has no idea her life's about to change forever. She's too busy enjoying the California summer. Her Internet tycoon mother, T.K. Truesdale, is out of town, and that means Delia can spend all her time at the beach, surfing. That is, until everything unravels. Her mother suddenly goes missing, and everyone thinks she's dead except Delia, who knows T.K.'s way too organized to simply disappear. But Delia's still sent to New York to live with her two aunts a downtown bohemian and an uptown ice queen. And in case that's not bad enough, she also has to deal with a snooty new school and trying not to fall for the wrong guy. Oh, and finding her mother. As she delves deeper into the tangle of conspiracies and lies surrounding T.K.'s disappearance, Delia begins to suspect that the wrong guy may be the right guy... and that some secrets especially the dangerous ones were never meant to be unraveled.
