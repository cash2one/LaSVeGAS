1244160:::::Christian Modesty and the Public Undressing of America:::::The Church is being destroyed by sacred cows. A ''sacred cow'' is an untouchable subject that we are not supposed to discuss. To do so impinges upon another's ''Christian liberty.'' Certainly, there are few sacred cows quite as sacred as the right of modern Christians to dress however they please. But in this groundbreaking work, Jeff Pollard challenges us to embrace God's standard and to understand the historical roots of the rise of nudity and immodesty in modern culture. His perspective is thoughtful and balanced. Most importantly, he accomplishes what few authors on this subject have achieved: a treatise that avoids both license and legalism. A courageous booklet.
