2474532:::::The Eagle and the Raven Part 1 of 3:::::Part One Of Three Parts In the first century A.D., the Celts were Britain's fiercest warriors. They lived in tribes, to which they gave aggressive loyalty. Under the tribal code, women hunted and fought alongside men. THE EAGLE AND THE RAVEN spans three generations. First is Caradoc, a king's son, who unites the people of the Raven and leads them against Rome. Eurgain, his wife, alone for months at a time, betrays Caradoc with his best friend. Gladys, Caradoc's warrior sister, falls in love with the Roman general who is her captor. Aricia, queen of the north joined Rome. Finally Boudicca, a strong-willed woman, carries to its conclusion the cause that is Caradoc's legacy.
