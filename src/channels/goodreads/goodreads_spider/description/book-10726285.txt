10726285:::::The Eternal War:::::Liam O Connor should have died at sea in 1912. Maddy Carter should have died on a plane in 2010. Sal Vikram should have died in a fire in 2026. But all three have been given a second chance to work for an agency that no one knows exists. Its purpose: to prevent time travel destroying history... A time wave has struck that alters the entire history of the American Civil War. Abraham Lincoln has followed Liam into the present from 1831and now the world is in a dangerous state of limbo... If the TimeRiders can t return Lincoln to the past, the Civil War will never end. Can Maddy persuade two colonels on either side of no man s land to cease fire long enough to save the future?
