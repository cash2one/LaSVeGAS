17981458:::::Flight of the Red Bandit:::::Each Geronimo Stilton book is fast-paced, with lively full-color art and a unique format kids 7-10 will love. One hot summer afternoon, I was trying to write, but I just couldn't get inspired. I needed a break! Who would've thought that soon I'd be in Arizona, hanging from cliffs and white-water rafting? Grandfather Shortpaws had sent me on a hunt for his old friend -- the Red Bandit. What a fabumouse adventure!
