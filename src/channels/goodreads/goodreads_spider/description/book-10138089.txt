10138089:::::A Bruised Heart:::::Alicia, Kimberlee, and Tomeka are three very close friends who all reside on different ends of the spectrum of love. Alicia, a successful real estate agent, has recently vowed to a life without men. Then she meets Jared, a younger, attractive department store worker who sweeps her off her feet. Alicia knows Jared could be her last chance at finding a love that can make her forget about her past, which includes a baby that she gave away out of desperation. The only problem is that Alicia's heart isn't completely available, because part of it still belongs to married, ex-boyfriend, Omar. Will Alicia's past define her future? As the wife of a prominent doctor, Kimberlee is a self-proclaimed diva. By her own admission, she cherishes money, shopping sprees, and her two toy poodles, Roxi and Sabri. She has it all. She's beautiful, charming, and filthy rich. The only thing missing in her marriage is love. Her husband, Eddie Lee believes that becoming parents will strengthen their bond. Kimberlee refuses to have children for fear of ruining her body... that is, until her husband's pregnant mistress waltzes into their lives pregnant. Will money continue to buy Kimberlee happiness. Tomeka is a minister's daughter, and the mother of twin boys, Khalil and Khalik. She's also a hustler's girlfriend and lives the fast life that is afforded to her by her drug dealing boyfriend Malik. No matter how hard she tries, being a hustler's girl makes it impossible to be a Christian. A tragedy in her life brings her back to her faith and gives her a new best friend, Tina. Now Tina has her eyes on Malik. But when Tomeka decides to turn her life around, will Malik follow, or will he allow Tina to ruin his family?
