Hunt me down, punish me and use me as you will I will run and I can hide, but we both know that I ll surrender to your every desire. Let there be no doubt; I choose to surrender to you. These are the hours that I live for; the hours that I long for. Belonging to you is what makes sense to me. So let s play, sir Chase me, thrill me, and possess me. The game is on.
