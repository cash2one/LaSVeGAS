2030441:::::Santa's Toy Shop:::::Inspired by a 1932 Walt Disney Silly Symphony animated short, the Santa's Toy Shop Little Golden Book was originally published in 1950. In this delightful story, Santa wants time to play with all the wonderful toys he and the elves have made, but he's just too busy--until Mrs. Claus gives him an idea! Disney animator Al Dempster and the Walt Disney Studio artists created Santa's Toy Shop.
