1560460:::::Horse Thief:::::Coming soon from Bantam Doubleday Dell Books for Young Readers! The Saddle Club is taking part in a big Pony Club rally being held at Pine Hollow. Riders from all the local Pony Clubs are there, including Stevie's boyfriend, Phil Marsten. For once Stevie and Phil aren't being too competitive so everyone is having a good time--until a thief spoils the fun by stealing $500 from the stable office. Veronica diAngelo says she saw Phil hanging around the office and acting suspiciously. And Phil did need money. But he'd never resort to theft, would he? Is Veronica up to something? Or is there a thief among the riders? It's up to the Saddle Club to find out and clear Phil's name.
