567687:::::The Gryphon: In Which the Extraordinary Correspondence of Griffin & Sabine Is Rediscovered:::::Isabella: The parcel did contain something unusual...65 cards and letters, the massed correspondence between Sabine and a man called Griffin Moss. It's odd stuff. I'm trying to decide if I've encountered an elaborate fiction, or a series of events that, if true, cast doubt over any concept of reality I've ever held. --Matthew The correspondence of Griffin Moss and Sabine Strohem, at turns enigmatic, sumptuous, and romantic, reveals dangerous undercurrents and strange forces at work in the universe. These powers have only grown stronger with the couple's disappearance. Nothing is heard from them for quite some time, until Sabine asks Matthew Sedon, a young archaeologist working in Egypt, for help. As Matthew is reluctantly drawn into the intrigue, he finds encouragement from his strong-willed girlfriend, Isabella de Reims. Miles away in Paris, Isabella struggles with haunting glimpses of mythic landscapes and surreal creatures that come to her in waking dreams. Slowly Matthew and Isabella realize that to unlock this secret world is to open the door to their deepest yearnings. Author and artist Nick Bantock tells a story like no other: As you pull handwritten letters from stamped envelopes, the enchanting world of The Gryphon literally unfolds in your hands as it takes root in your imagination.
