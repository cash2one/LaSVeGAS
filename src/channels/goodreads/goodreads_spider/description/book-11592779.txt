11592779:::::A Love Story How God Pursued Me and Found Me: An Impossibly True Story:::::Those who grow up with the knowledge of God's love know that He is there to guide them in their life. Even in bad times, they know that God will help them see things through and come out better when the trials have ended. But what about those who have not been raised with God in their lives? Samantha Ryan Chandler knows about living without God. Or at least she thought. In A Love Story: How God Pursued Me and Found Me, she tells her story of love, hatred, abuse, forgiveness, betrayal, greed, enlightenment, and fear. Born to a pagan mother and a former altar boy living in a land of denial, she recounts how God was involved in her life even before she knew who He was. She shares the story of her trip to the Holy Land and how her prayers at the Wailing Wall were interrupted because of a hamburger. Yes, despite her tribulations, her life has had its funny moments as well. You'll find inspiration in A Love Story: How God Pursued Me and Found Me-and like Chandler, you, too, may find themselves pursued by God.
