1373618:::::No Commitment Required:::::Yvonne Michelson owns a small string of lingerie boutiques, but lately her designs have been lacklustre. Her partners believe there's nothing like love to spark creativity and cure her slump, but Yvonne isn't interested. Past scars have left her afraid to love. Michael Benjamin, on the surface at least, is the ideal male - tall, rich, white and handsome. With his own scars, given to him by his ex-wife, he has honed his anger into a 'love-em and leave-em' facade. Michael is one of the city's most eligible bachelors and is determined to remain that way. When they meet, sparks immediately fly and their first night of passion leaves them both shaken. Unable to go back to the way things were before, they agree to continue their personal relationship...with no commitment required. But as everyone knows, love has a way of obliterating even the best-laid plans.
