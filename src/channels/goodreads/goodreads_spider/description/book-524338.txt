524338:::::Recut Madness: Favorite Movies Retold for Your Partisan Pleasure:::::Recut Madness is a retelling of the Hollywood Classics for red states and blue states. Hollywood movies purport to appeal to a mass audience, but in America today, half the population would see The Passion of the Christ while the other half sees Brokeback Mountain. Such an inclusive strategy is no longer realistic. In Recut Madness some of the most beloved classics are retailed for one side or the other. From a red state Wizard of Oz (aka The Decider of Oz) to a blue state Jaws, Garner has reinvented colorization for the new millennium.
