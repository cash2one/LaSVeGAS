86560:::::Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam:::::The Rub iy t of Omar Khayy m (Persian: ) is the title that Edward FitzGerald gave to his translation of a selection of poems, originally written in Persian and numbering about a thousand, attributed to Omar Khayy m (1048 1131), a Persian poet, mathematician and astronomer. A ruba'i is a two-line stanza with two parts (or hemistichs) per line, hence the word rub iy t (derived from the Arabic language root for "four"), meaning "quatrains".
