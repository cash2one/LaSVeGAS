7247586:::::The Flight of the Feathered Serpent:::::This begins with the true story of a journalist in the Second World War. His life changes inexplicably after he meets a mysterious man who leaves him a series of profound writings. One of the writings is a firsthand account of Judas s life with Jesus and the events leading up to his betrayal. The writings also contain extraordinary insights into the lives of Judas, Jesus, and the Disciples, which seem to correlate with the recently discovered Gospel of Judas. Could these be the teachings of Judas Iscariot and his account of his relationship with Jesus? Could this be Judas s attempt to clear his name in an effort to change the world s perceptions and help humanity in its spiritual quest?
