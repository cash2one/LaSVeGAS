13502274:::::Fissure:::::His confidence on a hiatus, his swagger on sabbatical, and his ego bruised, Patrick Hayward is a shell of the man he once was. Cursing at and writing off love after the only woman he let himself fall for wound up marrying his older brother, Patrick enrolls himself at Stanford hoping college life, the California girls, and the epic surf will get him back to his free-spirited, ladies-man-extraordinaire self. Just when Patrick feels the shadow of himself returning, Emma Scarlett enters his life, seeing through his shenanigans and calling him on his crap. Intrigued by this fascinating creature who is ignorant to his charm, surrounded by four older brothers that look at Patrick like he's a bug to squish, and dating the same guy for the past six years who gives new meaning to the term territorial boyfriend, Patrick gravitates to Emma, knowing she's everything he shouldn't fall for. So, of course, he can't help himself. It doesn't take long for Patrick to discover Emma has as many secrets as he does. And hers may be just as dark as his. This time, falling for the girl could not only break his heart, but his spirit. FISSURE is the first installment in the two part series, THE PATRICK CHRONICLES, and is a side story to the best-selling YA series, THE EDEN TRILOGY. The final installment, FUSION, will be released in the summer of 2012.
