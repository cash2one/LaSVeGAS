19212783:::::Orion Connection:::::ORION CONNECTION is the first installment in the Legends Trilogy. Inspired by the Face on Mars and the unexplainable technological marvels that predate the rise of Egypt by thousands of years, S DeGiorgio offers an eerily plausible connection between Mars and the rise of modern civilization. This novel is rocket fuel for people seeking answers to the question, Are we alone? It s 2050, Earth s resources are nearly gone, and armies guard what precious little remains. As mankind prepares to set foot on Mars, leaders of an ancient society are forced out of the shadows to protect secrets they ve guarded for millennia. Orion s crew gets caught in the middle, and on the eve of Earth s first manned mission to Mars, unknown adversaries murder four of their own. As the reserve team is pressed into service, fears grow that co-conspirators may be on board. No one s ever gone farther than the moon. Rumor and espionage threaten to tear the crew apart at a time when America can t afford to fail, and they only have each other, elite training, and raw instincts to rely on. Not everyone believes they will make it home. Some even consider them expendable acceptable losses to advance the cause. Control of Mars mineral rights will reestablish America s position as the leader of the free world. Standing down is not an option but we re not the only country in the race for the red planet. This story kept me spellbound and on the edge of my seat! I have been reading non-stop all day and just couldn t put it down. Now I have to wait for the next book, which I hope is out soon. If you re looking for great action, science fiction, mystery and a fantastic cast of characters, this is the book you need to read. ~ RW
