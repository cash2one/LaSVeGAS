17758805:::::Fortunately, the Milk...:::::You know what it s like when your mum goes away on a business trip and Dad s in charge. She leaves a really, really long list of what he s got to do. And the most important thing is DON T FORGET TO GET THE MILK. Unfortunately, Dad forgets. So the next morning, before breakfast, he has to go to the corner shop, and this is the story of why it takes him a very, very long time to get back. Featuring: Professor Steg (a time-travelling dinosaur), some green globby things, the Queen of the Pirates, the famed jewel that is the Eye of Splod, some wumpires, and a perfectly normal but very important carton of milk.
