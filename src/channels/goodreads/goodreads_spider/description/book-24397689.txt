24397689:::::Bar Nights:::::"Bar Nights", the first volume of the "The Mire Man Trilogy", is a story revolving around Arlo, a man who's just turned 39. Fed up with the way his life has turned out thus far, he leaves his cheating wife, out of control preteen slut daughter and her "fiance", his unbearably demeaning job, and hits the highway. It isn't long before his car dies on him, and he's forced to take shelter in the only place available at the time: the for-rent room above a dive bar, named "Purgatory", positioned seemingly in the middle of nowhere. Convincing the owner to let him work off his rent, he spends his days drinking and care-taking the bar, running odd jobs for his boss, and spends his nights tucked away in his room drunkenly passing out to the sounds of whoever is playing the music downstairs...until one night he ventures out into the storm eternally encapsulating his world. And their paths unexpectedly converge. The meeting sets in motion a relentless and remorseless onslaught of emotions, bringing Arlo to the absolute breaking point of insanity and introducing him to a realization that redefines why he ended up at "Purgatory" to begin with. "Bar Nights" is author Dave Matthes' seventh novel, and is a spiritual sequel/epilogue to his first two works of literature, "The Slut Always Rides Shotgun" and "The Passive Aggressors".
