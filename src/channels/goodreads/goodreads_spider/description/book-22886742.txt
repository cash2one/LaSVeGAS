22886742:::::Journey To Healing and Wholeness:::::This is written as a "healing journey," not just as a book on healing, I think you will find it to be much broader in its scope than that. For I am writing this not just from academic knowledge, but as I write it, I am also going through this same journey to receive my healing. The book will guide the reader through the Word of God in a logical progression of steps, making the reader aware of the power behind the Word, for Jesus came to give us life and life more abundantly, John 10:10. God's Word is able to meet all of our needs if we but let His Word work in our lives, for we are generally the one's that limit the Word from working. The Word can heal us both emotional, physically and bring us into a closer and a deeper relationship with Him. If the world that we live in was actually created by God's Word, (Jesus), John 1:3, then God's Word is the parent force of all creation. Scripture goes on to say, all things were created by Him and for Him, Colossians 1:16; thus Jesus had a purpose for creating His creation. If these two scriptures are true, then it would be to our benefit to learn about this Man Jesus Christ and His Word. If our focus remains on the Word, we will then be lead into that abundant life, that Jesus came to give us, rather than just settling for what the world can give us.
