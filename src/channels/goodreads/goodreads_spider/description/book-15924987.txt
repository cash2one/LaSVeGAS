15924987:::::Tom Jones:::::Hilarious and sexually open as well as a sharp social commentary, this is the tale of the foundling Tom Jones and his journey from young boy to a lusty but kind man. During his formative years he must do battle with his enemies, including the hypocritical teacher Mr Thwackum and bullying local boy, Blifil, all the while silently bearing his love for the neighbour's beautiful daughter, Sophie. Daring in its depiction of prostitution and promiscuity, Tom Jones became a bestseller due to its wit, sex, and romance.
