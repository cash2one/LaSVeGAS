6305171:::::Just Recipes: Easy to Cook Recipes with Inexpensive Ingredients You Already Have in Your Kitchen:::::Cooking has always been a fun experience for me, and having a family to cook for has been such a pleasure. I don't always have time to make every meal a work of art, but I always make sure that we eat healthy, well balanced meals. The quality of the ingredients will definitely affect the final meal, but quality ingredients are not necessarily the most expensive ones! I hope that these recipes can contribute to your household's dining experience. These recipes were created within a family budget during economic turmoil. College students can enjoy the money they will save, as well as the left-over's. This book is the perfect size to throw in your carry on for your get-away. Instead of always going out, stay in, relax. Enjoy a homemade meal that is easy to cook, does not require a lot of fancy ingredients, or cooking gadgets, and is simply beautiful and delicious. Cooking is fun. After all, they are just recipes! Karen M. Fjeldheim
