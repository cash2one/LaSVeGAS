If all goes well, Tyler and his friends will earn enough money to spend spring break in Cancun. But someone else has taken up residence in the old mansion, and he has a plan of his own... Drums of the Nunne hi: Carl and Jessica fell for each other during their final year of high school. Unfortunately, they come from different worlds. The people of their small Oklahoma town were taught from an early age that they should steer clear of the kids from the Cherokee reservation, and the animosity flows both ways. Carl's mother is heartbroken to learn that her only son has strayed from his people by falling in love with a white girl, while Jessica's family sees any relationship with a 'Rez Kid' as the ultimate betrayal-and they want Carl to pay for their daughter's mistake.
