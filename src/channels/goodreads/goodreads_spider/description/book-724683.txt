724683:::::El Manuscrito Hallado En Una Botella:::::MS. Found in a Bottle is a short story classic written by Edgar Allan Poe and first published in 1833. The plot follows an unnamed narrator at sea who finds himself in a series of harrowing circumstances. As he nears his own disastrous death while his ship drives ever southward, he writes an "MS." or manuscript telling of his adventures which he casts into the sea. Some critics believe the story was meant as a satire of typical sea tales.
