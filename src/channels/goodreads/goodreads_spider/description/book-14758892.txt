14758892:::::Identical Differences:::::Alexia Patterson has spent her whole life waiting to get out of small town Longsville, Oregon. Her twin sister, Rachel, is a completely different story. When Rachel calls to tell Lexi that she s engaged and asks her to come home for a few weeks before the wedding, Lexi is anything but eager to go back to Longsville. Add in Justin MacPherson, a guy she s hated since junior high, and the two weeks are not looking good. Surely God s plan isn t to make Lexi insane, right?
