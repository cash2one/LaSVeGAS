And then there are the expectations of his father and his "associates." Dom's father, although long past, had left unfulfilled expectations of his own. Everything he built, bled for, killed for... died for, was left in Dom's hands. Dom tried to change things, set things straight, atone for the sins of his father and father-in-law. But, it hasn't been easy. Many others benefitted from his business dealings, and aren't willing to loose them so easily. Emilio Rizzo has vowed to keep things the way they were. He's waged a war to take full control from Dom, with no concern for the toll it will take on everyone involved. Innocents will be harmed, lives will will be taken, and hard-earned progress will be lost unless Dom steps in and fights the way he was born to. Someone will be disappointed. Will it be his family, his employees, his father, or his beloved V, when he becomes... BOSS.
