A Tribute to The Highwayman by Alfred Noyes This novella is a tipping of the hat to Alfred Noyes. Oh, what silken dreams were spun on the wheel of his romantic poem, The Highwayman . If you leaned out the window with the innkeeper's daughter and sighed over the dashing highwayman, this is a story for you. Several verses are echoed in the chapter headings, and the complete poem is available at the end of the book. This improbable tale is written solely for your delight and enjoyment. Should you happen to crave more information about the highly romanticized, sometimes brutal truths behind the real highwaymen of myth and legend, please visit Kathleen's website. Until then, take a deep breath; close your eyes to harsh realities, and stroll into Claegburn Woods where the moon rides high and the owls are hunting on silent wing, there we will enter the lives of a rather unusual band of Robinhoodlums.
