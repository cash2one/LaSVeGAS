11717230:::::The Dark Notes, Book I:::::There are a number of personal imaginary works mentioned in the Living Sword Chronicles, like books of magic, old and long lost scriptures of mythical history etc. As a long time reader, that had always prayed for a chance to read, these of course imaginary books and always ended up getting disappointed, because they were nowhere to be found, I decided to write this collection... of poems. More stories than poems of course, they constitute an important part of the mythology behind the Living Sword Chronicles and the stepping stones of an even larger story I've been constructing for the last ten years. The world of the Three Realms. In this first volume, two major works are presented. The Old Words and the first part of the infamous Book of Walks.
