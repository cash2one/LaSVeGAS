467185:::::The Thoughts and Meditations of Kahlil Gibran:::::This volume of writings by Kahlil Gibran contains examples of three aspects of his genius. There is the impassioned fighter against politics, for Gibran the embodiment of corruption, injustice and ignorance. In a series of evocative allegories he imagines, against a background of the evils of modern society, the world as it might be if it were governed by reason and understanding. There is the poet of love, whose wonderful responsiveness to the beauties of nature is expressed in sensuous and delicate prose and verse. perhaps most impressive amongst all Gibran's writings are his mystical, visionary poems, describing the transmigration of souls, through tales of lovers tragically parted in one existence and reunited after centuries of separation in a later incarnation.
