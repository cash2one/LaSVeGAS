737629:::::Pawn's Dream:::::"Dreaming awake and asleep," Roland Pritchard's life is a busy one. When he wakes in our world, he's stuck in a marginal job trying to care for his disturbed mother; when he sleeps in our world, he pursues a scholar's life in the isolated, mysterious Abbey. Sleeping or waking, both lives are frustratingly constrained, and when Roland is offered opportunities to break away in both worlds, he embarks on dual journeys of self-discovery leading to union.
