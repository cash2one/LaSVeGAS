20872079:::::Lost in Me:::::The last thing I remember is having drinks at Brady s and trying to avoid eye-contact with my life-long crush the gorgeous, unattainable Maximilian Hallowell. They tell me that was a year ago, but I have no memories of anything since then. What I do have is this ring on my finger that Max says he gave me, and this much-thinner body I ve dreamed of most of my life. Aside from a case of retrograde amnesia, everything seems almost...perfect. But the deeper I immerse myself into this new world of mine planning a wedding to a man I don't remember dating, attempting to run a business I don't remember starting the clearer it becomes that nothing is as it seems. Do I have the life I ve always wanted or is it a facade propped up by secrets I don't even know I have? I need answers before I marry Max, and the only person who seems to have them is the angry, tatted, sexy-as-sin rocker Nate Crane. And Nate wants me for himself.
