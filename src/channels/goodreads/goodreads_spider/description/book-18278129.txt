18278129:::::The Dark Light of Day:::::Abby has been through hell and has survived one of the most brutal childhoods imaginable... barely. To the outside world she is just a loner with an attitude. When her grandmother dies in a tragic explosion, Abby is left with questions-and nothing else. Homeless, sleeping in a junkyard, and on the run from a system that has failed her over and over again, she meets Jake, a tattooed blue-eyed biker with secrets that rival her own. Two broken souls that can't be healed. They can't be saved. Abby &amp; Jake have to decide if they can accept the darkness not only within one another, but within themselves. If they can accept each other for who they really are, they might be able to learn that love isn't always found in the light. Caution: This is not your typical romance. The story of Abby &amp; Jake contains disturbing situations, graphic violence, sex, strong language, drug use, and all types of abuse. Dark Needs, A Dark Light of Day Novella, is available now.
