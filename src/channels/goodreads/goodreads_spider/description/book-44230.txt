44230:::::The Silver Pigs:::::Falco is a Roman informer who has a nose for trouble. In the Forum, where pretty Sosia flees for her life, he rashly decides to save her - and regrets the move. She has stolen Imperial ingots. Senator's daughter Helena Justina is connected to traitors Falco has sworn to expose. The snooping plebe faces a murderous cabal.
