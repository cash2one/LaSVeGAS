22025754:::::Redemption:::::Choose your hero wisely. Have you ever wanted the power to decide who the heroine of a story will ultimately end up with? Now is your chance with Drawn 2 where you have a choice of TWO sequels in which the characters follow TWO different paths to lead them to your chosen 'happily ever after'. This is not two stories told from different points of view. This is not an alternate ending - it's an entirely separate path that readers who choose to read both sequels will appreciate the 'sliding door' moments that set our characters off in a different direction. Different choices. Different fates. You hold the power You get to choose - Damien... or Aaron. In Drawn, we met Etta and watched as her obsessive relationship with Damien sent both of them into world of darkness and self-destruction. We also met Aaron, the constant in Etta's life - the man who was willing to do anything it took to keep her safe. Two Men. One woman. A decision that will change everything... That decision is yours... Three years have passed since Damien lost Etta. His obsessive and irrational behaviour drove her away and destroyed his life. For three years he has languished in prison. Every day he had but one thought - Etta. She is the holder of his soul and he can't see a life without her in it. When he is finally released and tracks her down, he is faced with something he didn't expect. His daughter, and Aaron. Damien needs to redeem himself in the eyes of the woman he loves. He needs to prove to her that he is the kind of man she can build a life with - even if that means telling her all of his secrets and possibly ruining everything for good.
