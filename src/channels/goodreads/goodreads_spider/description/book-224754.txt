224754:::::Invisible Collection:::::The first of these two Stefan Zweig tales, The Invisible Collection, is about a blind collector of rare prints who does not realize that his priceless Durers and Rembrandts have been sold by his family and replaced by blank sheets of paper. The second is the touching tale of Buchmendel, an old bookdealer who is himself a universal catalogue, entirely devoted to his trade. Zweig is a bestseller in Europe; Pushkin Press/Turtle Point are re-introducing his work to American readers.
