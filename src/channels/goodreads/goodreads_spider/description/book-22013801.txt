22013801:::::Crave:::::I have a craving. A dark urge I ve failed to resist despite years of trying to do that very thing. I ve forced myself to hide behind a mask, a perfect orchestration to hide my true self. After I met her, my wants and needs, my inner most desires changed. She encouraged me to embrace who I truly am, and she was willing to do anything and everything I wanted, giving herself to satisfy my most carnal appetite. Then everything in my carefully managed world came crashing down around me. A moment in time, a loss of control, and the very thing I cherish was nearly taken from me. My fate now lies in her hands. The very life I ve built for myself everything I ve ever done now waits in purgatory, all caused by a lack of focus at a time when my most concentrated attention was needed. The very thing I crave may now be the end of me.
