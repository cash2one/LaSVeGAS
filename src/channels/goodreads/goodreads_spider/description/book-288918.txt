288918:::::The Flower Man:::::Part-time actress and full-time mother Britt Hinson thought that most of her life's drama was confined to the stage. Then a threatening presence entered her world, a mysterious stranger that no one but her pretty nine-year-old, Katie, had seen. Katie calls him the Flower Man, and Britt and her husband, Mark, don't know whether to believe the child's bizarre tales of the notes and flowers he's left her-- lilies, forget-me-nots, a black rose. But Britt's fears intensify when, with his threatening phone calls and aggressive prowling of their home, the Flower Man draws her into a fight for her daughter's life. The Hinsons become a family under siege. And Britt knows a mother's love won't be enough to protect Katie from harm..... With gripping realism, THE FLOWER MAN pits a parent's love, a child's honesty, and a family's security against the desperate acts of a relentless stalker.
