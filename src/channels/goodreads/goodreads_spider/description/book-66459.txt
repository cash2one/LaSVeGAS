66459:::::Good Luck: Creating the Conditions for Success in Life and Business:::::Good Luck is a whimsical fable that teaches a valuable lesson: good luck doesn't just come your way--it's up to you to create the conditions to bring yourself good luck. Written by Alex Rovira and Fernando Trias de Bes--two leading marketing consultants--this simple tale is universally applicable and uniquely inspirational. Good Luck tells the touching story of two old men, Max and Jim, who meet by chance in Central Park fifty years after they last saw each other as children. Max achieved great success in life; Jim sadly did not. The secret to Max's success lies in a story his grandfather told him long ago. This story within a story has a tone reminiscent of the classic The Alchemist and shows how to seize opportunity and achieve success in life. In a surprise ending, Good Luck comes full circle, offering the reader inspiration, instruction, and an engaging tale.
