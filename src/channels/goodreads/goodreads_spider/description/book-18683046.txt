18683046:::::Derora's War:::::Eights years have passed since Derora Saxen stood on the cliff s edge and watched a circle of ash sinking slowly into the icy surf; the ash that had once been the body of Thomas Delauncey. This was the price demanded by the legend of stone and bone. Or so she was told to believe. The years since Tom s disappearance have brought prosperity to the continent of Solquin. There are no more earth events, nor wars of mass chaos, and life has moved on for the most part. Silver Dawn s Horizon is still undergoing reconstruction, Chloe has gained control over her abilities, Thistle still trains Thalon relentlessly, Ameris has come south. Sure, Der has other duties, including a paid gig with Strival, but she hunts for Tom s whereabouts whenever she can. But that time is fast running out, and she doesn t even know it. The legend was as old as time itself, passed down from the war of the world s creation. It is the legend of two demon brothers who wielded the power to undo creation itself. One of crystal. One of stone. Where one goes, the other shall follow. This is the legend of stone and bone, and it hasn t finished with our hero yet. Now, in the penultimate novel of the All Things Impossible series, Der is about to discover the legend is very real, and it was just getting started those eight years ago. And against an evil as ancient and powerful as time itself, even all her strength and courage will not be enough...
