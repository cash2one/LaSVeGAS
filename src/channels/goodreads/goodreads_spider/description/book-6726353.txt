6726353:::::Haunted:::::Dee is feeding the chickens the morning that bones are discovered on the mountain. Something doesn't feel right and her feeling is confirmed when local police show her a ring that they found with the bones, a ring belonging to Mary Ann Simpson, who disappeared four years earlier. Other girls, Dee learns, have disappeared too, unusual for a small town nestled in the shadow of the Bruce Peninsula s rugged escarpment, the mountain that Dee loves. Like her Gran, Dee has the sight, an ability not only to see spirits from the afterlife but also to experience their deaths a quality that becomes more horrifying as the story takes darker turns. While trying to help with the investigation, Dee is drawn into a deepening mystery that soon strikes terrifyingly close to home.
