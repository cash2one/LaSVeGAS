11378689:::::Stresshead:::::OMG. Year 11 results are out TODAY, my boyfriend is MIA and my mum is acting TOTALLY WEIRD. I'd turn to my BF Kat, that her life has suddenly gone from hero to ZERO. I don't know who to talk to an everyone's got their OWN problems. What would life be better if I wasn't such a STRESSHEAD?
