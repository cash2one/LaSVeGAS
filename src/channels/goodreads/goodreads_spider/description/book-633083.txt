633083:::::Kilkenny:::::By the world's greatest writer of Westerns, Louis L'Amour. Fawcett reprint of 1954 Ace Book. ""Kilkenny drew back slightly, his gun still in his hand. He looked from one man ot the other. "You saw it. He asked for it. I didn't want to kill him. I wasn't hunting for trouble when I came here, I was just trying to eat a quiet meal. What did he want to jump me for?"" Nobody spoke for a few seconds, then an old man said quietly, "Don't blame yourself, stranger. The boy has been hunting for trouble ever since he killed a man in Texas.""
