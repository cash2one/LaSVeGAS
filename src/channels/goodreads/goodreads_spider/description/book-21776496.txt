As the hero "Titan," an immortal from Mt. Olympus and the son of Gaia, he is also the strongest person to ever walk the face of the Earth.

As they fall in love, the two of them will together face the greatest adventure of their lives as Gaius, Earth's sworn protector, will face the greatest battle of his life as he attempts to stop a human killing machine long thought dead from wrecking havoc on his adopted home. Can an Olympian die, or will he be able to find the strength to not only save himself, but everyone he holds dear? From the author: I love super heroes. Comic books have been a large part of my life for three decades and I have fond memories of losing myself in those colorful pages for hours on end. When I set out to write this book I wanted to capture the essence of those wonderful books that I read when I was a kid and put it into novel form. Hopefully, I have succeeded.
