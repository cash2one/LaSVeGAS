2158606:::::Dark Sun:::::Dark Sun This story takes place between The Sleepwalker and The General . Nukes and sleepovers... It's the last day of term. Three lads are clearing out their lockers, organising a sleepover and hatching a plan to spatter a girl with rancid coleslaw. But things aren't what they seem. One boy's father is a member of Dark Sun, a criminal organisation dealing in nuclear weapons technology, while another is a CHERUB agent sent to stop him.
