1548013:::::The Ancestry of Diana, Princess of Wales: For Twelve Generations:::::An exhaustively researched account of the late Princess's forebears, tracing her ancestors from the British Isles to northern and eastern Europe as well as the United States and the Far East. Presented in ahnentafel format, the book also profiles of more than thirty key historic personages, including Sir Robert Walpole, the first British prime minister ; John Churchill, Duke of Marlborough, and his Duchess, Sarah; royal favorite Barbara Villiers, Duchess of Cleveland; Dr. Joseph Strong, the pioneering Philadelphia surgeon, perhaps Diana's most distinguished American forebear; and King James I of England, King Henri IV of France, and King Friedrich I of Bohemia. The book makes a substantial contribution to genealogical literature on the British royal family. It identifies the forebears Diana brought to the royal family and suggests much of her ancestry's social breadth, offering a capsule view of British history in its pages. Genealogists, royalty scholars, kinsmen (especially American kin), fans and followers of the British monarchy, and the millions who admired the Princess will all find this book interesting.
