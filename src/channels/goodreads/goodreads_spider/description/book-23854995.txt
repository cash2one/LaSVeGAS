23854995:::::My Weekly Walk:::::The voice of the Divine is always speaking, to those who are prepared to deeply listen! Whether by religious upbringing, teaching, or tradition, we tend to blindly pursue a dogma, suggesting that personal, intimate communication with the Divine, is solely restricted to those times when we express ourselves heavenward, in what is commonly referred to as prayer. If that s true, then we re getting a horrifically compromised return in our relationship to the Creator! What if we could be receiving what I like to refer to as a Divine Download 24/7, a non-stop 2-way communication with the Source of all Wisdom one that is literally out of this world? Well, we can! It all depends on us, the heart we possess and My Weekly Walk!!! As long as we settle for a heart of stone, we ll never truly be free from the chains that bind us! True freedom and living a life of purpose, reside in a new heart, a heart of flesh a Divine heart transplant!
