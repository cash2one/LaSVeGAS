870334:::::The Story of the Champions of the Round Table:::::Written two years after The Story of King Arthur and His Knights , this Howard Pyle book returns to Arthur's court and presents the adventure-filled stories of three worthy, noble, excellent knights-champions Sir Launcelot, Sir Tristram, and Sir Percival. The stories of these three knights are among the most colorful and enduring in the vast body of Arthurian legend. The love-story of Tristram and the beautiful Isoult, of King Mark and of magic potions; the wondrous legend of Launcelot's emergence from the castle of the Round Table; Percival's championship of the Lady Yvette and his adventures at the Castle of Beaurepaire these are all retold in Pyle's inimitable style, capturing perfectly the tone and spirit of ancient romance. Just as successful are Pyle's illustrations. 50 drawings, 31 of them full-page size, help make this one of the most memorable adventure books ever written for young readers. These stories have inspired numerous film adaptations, including the 2017 release Knights of the Roundtable: King Arthur , directed by Guy Ritchie and starring Charlie Hunnam, Jude Law, Eric Bana, Djimon Hounsou, and Annabelle Wallis.
