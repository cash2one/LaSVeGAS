Reluctantly given shelter at nearby Hatville Court, she is despised by the masters and servants alike. The beautiful Hatville heiress, Aurelia Vennaway, is Amy's only advocate - she becomes the light of Amy's life, and the centre of her existence. So when Aurelia dies young, Amy's world collapses. But Aurelia leaves Amy with one last gift. A bundle of letters with a coded key. A treasure hunt that only Amy can unlock. A life-changing secret awaits... if only she can reach it.
