730250:::::The Pinballs:::::You can't always decide where life will take you--especially when you're a kid. Carlie knows she's got no say in what happens to her. Stuck in a foster home with two other kids, Harvey and Thomas J, she's just a pinball being bounced from bumper to bumper.

And all three of them start to see that they can take control of their own lives.
