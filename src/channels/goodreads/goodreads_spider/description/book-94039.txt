Lucky Santangelo is back with a vengeance--still every bit as strong, sexy, and seductive as ever! But Lucky is older and wiser, and hot to reclaim her power position in Las Vegas. However, a deadly enemy from her past has resurfaced--a person determined to take everything from her, including the family she holds so dear: two sons and an out-of-control teenage daughter who is just as outrageous as Lucky herself. Like mother, like daughter. And if that old saying holds true, it's going to be one wild ride. Internationally bestselling author Jackie Collins marks her twenty-fifth novel with "another page-turning tale packed with intrigue, revenge and romance," ( Publishers Weekly on Lovers and Players ). Aren't we lucky?!
