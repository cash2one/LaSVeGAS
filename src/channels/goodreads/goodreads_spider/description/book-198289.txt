198289:::::Fields of Fire:::::Originally published in 1978, Webb's classic novel of the Vietnam War follows three soldiers from different worlds who are plunged into a white-hot murderous realm of jungle warfare as it was fought by one Marine platoon in the An Hoa Basin in 1969. 'They each had their reasons for being a soldier. They each had their illusions. Goodrich came from Harvard. Snake got the tattoo Death Before Dishonor before he got the uniform. And Hodges was haunted by the ghosts of family heroes. They had no way of knowing what awaited them. Nothing could have prepared them for the madness to come. And in the heat and horror of battle they took on new identities, took on each other, and were each reborn in fields of fire.... Fields of Fire is James Webb s classic, searing novel of the Vietnam War, a novel of poetic power, razor-sharp observation, and agonizing human truths seen through the prism of nonstop combat. Weaving together a cast of vivid characters, Fields of Fire captures the journey of unformed men through a man-made hell until each man finds his fate.'
