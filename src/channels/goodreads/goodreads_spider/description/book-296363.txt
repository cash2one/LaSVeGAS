"Frieda, the narrator and eponymous "daughter," opens the novel, speaking as a fetus from an Edenic state of unbounded freedom and perception in which she can "create anything..".philosophical brilliance and surreal humor in Chapman's prose amply reward the reader's attention"--Publishers Weekly. "As we trip through Frieda's life and her forays into art, love, politics, self-actualization, and self-destruction, thematic justice seems to be among the least of Chapman's concerns.
