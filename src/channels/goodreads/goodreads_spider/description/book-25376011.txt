25376011:::::For Real:::::Alternate cover for this ISBN can be found here Laurence Dalziel is worn down and washed up, and for him, the BDSM scene is all played out. Six years on from his last relationship, he s pushing forty and tired of going through the motions of submission. Then he meets Toby Finch. Nineteen years old. Fearless, fierce, and vulnerable. Everything Laurie can t remember being. Toby doesn t know who he wants to be or what he wants to do. But he knows, with all the certainty of youth, that he wants Laurie. He wants him on his knees. He wants to make him hurt, he wants to make him beg, he wants to make him fall in love. The problem is, while Laurie will surrender his body, he won t surrender his heart. Because Toby is too young, too intense, too easy to hurt. And what they have no matter how right it feels can t last. It can t mean anything. It can t be real.
