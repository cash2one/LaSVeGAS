This captivating book chronicles the life of polyamorous advocate and postmodern nomad Serena Anderlini-D'Onofrio, whose skillful prose takes readers along the bold twists and turns of her life, and her irreverent critiques of society, education, and sexuality.

From her educational beginnings to her love of nudity and freedom from bodily inhibitions, the author reveals her innermost thoughts and shares the wisdom life has blessed her with. She candidly narrates both her journey over the treacherous path from graduate student to educator in California, and from a straight and monogamous young adulthood to an alternative and fulfilling lifestyle. An extraordinary read for those who want to expand their horizons, Eros is an engaging and honest testimony of a passage into unconventional realms of growth, self-discovery, the erotic, and the many possibilities for love. Follow the emergence of this exceptional woman who's made a career of defying convention for the sake of integrity--a woman well worth getting to know!
