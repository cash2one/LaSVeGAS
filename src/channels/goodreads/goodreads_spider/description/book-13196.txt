Now sixteen, Atalanta, famous archer and swiftest mortal alive, has devoted her life to the goddess. When strangers appear in Atalanta's village one day, they bring shattering news. The father who forsook her is a king. And he has summoned his daughter with a simple, chilling command: marry and produce an heir.
