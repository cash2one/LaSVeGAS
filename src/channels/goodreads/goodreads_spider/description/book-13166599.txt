13166599:::::Atlantic Fever: Lindbergh, His Competitors, and the Race to Cross the Atlantic:::::For five weeks from April 14 to May 21, 1927 the world held its breath while fourteen aviators took to the air to capture the $25,000 prize that Raymond Orteig offered to the first man to cross the Atlantic Ocean without stopping. Joe Jackson s Atlantic Fever is about this race, a milestone in American history whose story has never been fully told. Delving into the lives of the big-name competitors the polar explorer Richard Byrd, the French war hero Ren Fonck, the millionaire Charles Levine, and the race s eventual winner, the enigmatic Charles Lindbergh as well as those whose names have been forgotten by history (such as Bernt Balchen, Stanton Wooster, and Clarence Chamberlin), Jackson brings a completely fresh and original perspective to the race to conquer the Atlantic. Atlantic Fever opens for us one of those magical windows onto a moment when the nexus of technology, innovation, character, and spirit led so many contenders from different parts of the world to be on the cusp of the exact same achievement at the exact same time.
