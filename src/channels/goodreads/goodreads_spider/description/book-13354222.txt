13354222:::::Jeweler's Apprentice:::::Fia Brithin is beginning an adventure. On her first visit to the King Hanor's palace, 16 year old Fia Brithin stumbles into a court intrigue. To keep the secret safe, the Chancelor sends her off as apprentice to a famous, and reclusive, high mountain jeweler. ...And straight into adventure. Discovering gems with deep secrets and new friends with the same, Fia learns a whole lot more than just modeling wax. When to trust a stranger, and when not to; why not to try stealing from gem thieves; what heroism is, what royalty ought to be, and that the mountains themselves can sometimes be the greatest danger of all. The first in a series, Jeweler's Apprentice introduces protagonist Fia Brithin to the wide, wide world, and starts her on a journey toward adventures, and that difficult thing called growing up.
