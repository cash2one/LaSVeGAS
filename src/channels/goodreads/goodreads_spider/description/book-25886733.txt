25886733:::::A Church in the House:::::The families of Christians should be little Churches: or, Wherever we have a house, God should have a Church in it. The Rev. Matthew Henry is most well-known for the timeless and practical expositions found in his commentaries on the Old and New Testaments. What most people don t know, however, is that Henry was a model husband and father who believed that a properly organized home life includes as a necessity a strong spiritual foundation. Henry believed that while the home is not meant to replace the church, it is meant by God to be a place of spiritual growth and renewal. In that vein, A Church in the House is a manual of sorts, showing us that effective ministry inside the home is just as important as ministry done on the outside.
