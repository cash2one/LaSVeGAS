15743742:::::Middle Damned:::::Life after death was not all they expected for Blake Stillwater and his family. Some went to live in the light. Another went into darkness. Blake fights for survival against the forces of evil, somewhere between, in the Realm of the Middle Damned. At this crossroads, which connect the dimensions of the Living World and the hereafter, failure is a one-way ticket to everlasting torment in the lake of fire. Blake s only hope lies in the gifts of those he was responsible for in the car crash that claimed their lives. The blood staining his hands entitles them to endow him with a final token of their memory. It s a race against time, for while the gifts of those who love the light will sustain, the one who now dwells in darkness can ruin it all. Blake may well survive, but when it s found his spirit is tied to a comatose body in the Living World, existence becomes a fight for control of his soul. With demon-possessed and Willing Servants of the Dark seeking to use him as a gateway between worlds, a band of heroes dedicated to righteousness rallies to his aid. All Middle Damned are now threatened by demons in their natural forms coming through the portal against them. The odds are stacked high and on the verge of defeat a new thought distracts Blake. Is what he works toward real or is he lost in a coma-induced dream? In an attempt to get back to those of his family who survived, Blake will be willing to risk it all, and the rest be Damned.
