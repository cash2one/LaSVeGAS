885122:::::The Girl on the High Diving Horse:::::Ivy Cordelia is plain lucky. It's the summer of 1936, and she gets to stay in Atlantic City all summer long, where there's so much to see: boxing kangaroos, human cannonballs, card-playing cats ... and high-diving horses! If there's anyone luckier than she is, it must be the girl on the high-diving horse, who daily performs her dangerous-looking act while the crowd cheers. Ivy's dream is to be that girl. But could she ever be that brave? The spun-candy-and-sea-spray world of the Atlantic City boardwalk in the 1930s once again comes powerfully to life under the nostalgic artistry of Ted Lewin and Linda Oatman High.
