263972:::::The Case for Faith: A Journalist Investigates the Toughest Objections to Christianity:::::Was God telling the truth when he said, "You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart"?In his #1 best-seller The Case for Christ, Lee Strobel examined the claims of Christ, reaching the hard-won verdict that Jesus is God's unique son. In The Case for Faith, Strobel turns his skills to the most persistent emotional objections to belief--the eight "heart barriers" to faith. The Case for Faith is for those who may be feeling attracted to Jesus but who are faced with difficult questions standing squarely in their path. For Christians, it will deepen their convictions and give them fresh confidence in discussing Christianity with even their most skeptical friends."Everyone--seekers, doubters, fervent believers--benefits when Lee Strobel hits the road in search of answers, as he does again in The Case for Faith. In the course of his probing interviews, some of the toughest intellectual obstacles to faith fall away."--Luis Palau
