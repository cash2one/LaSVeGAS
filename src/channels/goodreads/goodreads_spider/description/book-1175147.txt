1175147:::::Angelique:::::The story begins in 1648 during a time of insurrection, terror and revolt in a divided France. Ang lique de Sance de Monteloup, a vibrant twelve-year-old tomboy, is the daughter of a simple nobleman impoverished by taxes and other burdens. Ang lique joins the local peasant children in their games, ranges the ancient forests and swamps of Poitou and when bandits visit destruction and rapine on the humble villagers, our heroine's leadership qualities come to the fore for the first time. The book also tells of Ang lique's first meetings with two crucial characters - King Louis XIV of France and Joffrey. One of the scenes in the book sees Ang lique and Joffrey attend the wedding of Louis XIV and his queen, Marie-Therese. As Ang lique and Joffrey tangle with powerful forces, it is a classic and gripping adventure story, but we also learn about the couple's tender and often unpredictable relationship. The climax of the book is a decision by the French court which has an impact on the whole of the rest of the story - destined to move to the dangerous streets of Paris for the second book...
