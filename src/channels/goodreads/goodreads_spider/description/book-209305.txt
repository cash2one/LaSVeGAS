209305:::::The True Face Of God:::::In France, in 1973, Claude Vorilhon met an extraterrestrial. They met again for six consecutive days, one hour at a time. What he learned then is flabbergasting and essential at the same time for the future of humanity. Life on Earth is not the work of an immaterial god, nor did it happen by chance. Extraterrestrial scientists created all forms of life on Earth thanks to a perfect control of genetic engineering. This Message demystefies our origins and the world's oldest book, the Bible. In fact, the word God is a mistaken translation of the Hebrew word Elohim which is really a plural word meaning, "Those who came from the sky.." Our ancestors, unable to understand all the science and technology of the Elohim, took them for gods. In 1975, Rael was taken to the planet of the Elohim. There he saw amazing things which he revealed in the second message. In this book, you will also find the keys allowing todays men and women to open their minds to the world of the 21st century. The Elohim transmit a new philosophy of love and fellowship which is adapted to the technological progress of our time.
