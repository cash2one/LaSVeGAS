28001704:::::Dashing Through the Stars:::::The holidays are a time of love, joy, and meeting a new alien species? Prince of the Ujal, Tave fa V yl-Zeret, will do anything to make his mate happy. Even if that means celebrating a holiday he does not understand. (Tave does not care what human lore states, a single human could not circle the globe and deliver toys to every child.) This year s biggest concern isn t whether he purchased enough toys for his youngling, but the alien battleship that enters Earth s orbit. Are they friend? Or foe? Will Tave s family and friends live to see Christmas morning? Or will they all perish on Christmas Eve? For there is a humbug willing to go to any lengths to stop peace talks. Lengths that include kidnapping royalty and assassination.
