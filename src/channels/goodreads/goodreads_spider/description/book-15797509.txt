15797509:::::The Inconvenient Indian: A Curious Account of Native People in North America:::::WINNER of the 2014 RBC Taylor Prize The Inconvenient Indian is at once a history and the complete subversion of a history in short, a critical and personal meditation that the remarkable Thomas King has conducted over the past 50 years about what it means to be Indian in North America. Rich with dark and light, pain and magic, this book distills the insights gleaned from that meditation, weaving the curiously circular tale of the relationship between non-Natives and Natives in the centuries since the two first encountered each other. In the process, King refashions old stories about historical events and figures, takes a sideways look at film and pop culture, relates his own complex experiences with activism, and articulates a deep and revolutionary understanding of the cumulative effects of ever-shifting laws and treaties on Native peoples and lands. This is a book both timeless and timely, burnished with anger but tempered by wit, and ultimately a hard-won offering of hope -- a sometimes inconvenient, but nonetheless indispensable account for all of us, Indian and non-Indian alike, seeking to understand how we might tell a new story for the future. From the Hardcover edition.
