Chris Jones, Chicago Tribune Tasty dialogue, spiky confrontations and more than occasionally biting observations RACE riffs artfully on the subtleties of discrimination and guilt, resentment and shame, and its ambiguities appear designed to stir audiences into testy debates. David Rooney, Variety Edgily compelling Few writers can grip an audience like David Mamet.

But even as his lawyers one of them white, another black begin to strategize, they must confront their own biases and assumptions about race relations in America.
