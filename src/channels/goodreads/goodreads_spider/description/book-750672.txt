750672:::::Mermaids on the Moon:::::Elizabeth Stuckey-French welcomes you to Mermaid Springs a sparkling, bubbly world where secretive mermaids swim, a psychic cat gives mysterious messages, and Elvis still reigns. As a young woman, Grendy swam her way to fame in the kitschy underwater pageants of Mermaid Springs, a premier attraction of pre-Disney Florida. When she met her minister husband, North, she hung up her fins and moved with him to the Midwest. Thirty-six years later, a reunion of the Mermaids of Yesteryear brings Grendy and North back to Mermaid City, where they decide to purchase a second home. In no time at all, Grendy lands a starring role in the Mermaids on the Moon Labor Day spectacular, and life seems very good indeed. So when Grendy suddenly goes missing, leaving only a cryptic note behind, her daughter, France, goes to Mermaid City to find out what happened. While taking over care of her erratic six-year-old nephew, Theo, who is most affected by Grendy s disappearance, France explores the odd circles her mother moved in. Grendy s fellow Mermaids of Yesteryear or merhags are forthcoming about every detail of their friendship except her disappearance, and they seem much more interested in convincing France to step into her mother s fins for the big Labor Day show. As France grows more concerned that her mother may have been a victim of foul play, she makes extraordinary discoveries about Grendy and wonders why the mermaids still talk about the night Elvis came to town. With Elizabeth Stuckey-French s wonderfully original voice and zest for offbeat characters ( Chicago Tribune ), Mermaids on the Moon is a delightful immersion in a bracingly fresh novel with just the right mix of sly wit and warmth.
