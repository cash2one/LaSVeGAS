22237407:::::Ruthless People:::::"Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith meets the Sopranos..." To the outside world, they look like American Royalty, giving to charities, feeding the homeless, rebuilding the city. But behind closed doors is a constant battle for dominance between two Bosses, cultures, and hearts. Ruthless People is a romantic crime fiction set in modern day Chicago, and follows the life and marriage of Melody Giovanni and Liam Callahan rivals by blood and leaders through fear. Their marriage, arranged by their fathers in hopes to end years of bloodshed between the Irish and the Italians. Liam believes he s getting a simple-minded wife, one he can control, one who bends to his every need . . . the complete opposite of Melody. She knows exactly what type of man he is, and would rather die than give up the power she has spent her life building. The Mafia of the past has evolved, and with rival bosses gunning for them, Melody and Liam will have to learn to work as one to take down those who stand in their way. 1 Marriage x 2 Bosses = 3x the Chaos *Warning: Due to bad language, graphic violence and sex this is for over-18's only* Theses are not mobsters with a heart of gold.... They do VERY bad things and will NOT change. They are criminals...murders. If things like that bother you Ruthless People is not for you. You've been warned ;)
