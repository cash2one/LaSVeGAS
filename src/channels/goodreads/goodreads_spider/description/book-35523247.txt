35523247:::::Breathe In:::::Breathe in. Breathe out. This mantra gets Tessa Benson through the day. The man she loves walks all over her, and she just wants to get by without her heart shattering to pieces. If she could find her voice, she d scream. Everything changes in one night, when she s snatched from the streets and tied to a bed, a camera set up to capture her dying moment. And the person who paid to watch her die...is still out there somewhere. Tessa prowls dark neighborhoods in a quest for justice, but she doesn t find the killer. Not until they strike again in the place Tessa is least expecting, and where it hurts worst.
