2479923:::::Worship Him: Discover The Joy of Pure Spiritual Worship:::::Dr. Fuchsia Pickett's life study of the Holy Spirit takes a fresh turn as she explores the outward evidence of an inward relationship. We will worship day and night with our whole hearts as we "walk in the Spirit" as a response to coming face to face with Jesus Christ, who is revealed to us by the Spirit. Students of the Bible and those responsible for worship will appreciate the depth of her teaching. Those who worship as an expression of joy will better understand what the Word promises for those who worship!
