9939976:::::The Return of Black Douglas:::::He'll help a woman in need, no matter where she came from... Alysandir Mackinnon rules his clan with a fair but iron fist. He has no time for softness or, as he sees it, weakness. But when he encounters a bewitching young beauty who may or may not be a dangerous spy, but is surely in mortal danger, he's compelled to help. She's always wondered if she was born in the wrong time... Thrown back in time to the tumultuous, dangerous Scottish Highlands of the sixteenth century, Isobella Douglas has a lot to learn about her ancestors, herself, and her place in the world. Especially when she encounters a Highland laird who puts modern men to shame. Each one has secrets to keep, until they begin to strike a chord in each other's hearts that's never been touched before.
