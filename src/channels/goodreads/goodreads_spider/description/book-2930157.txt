2930157:::::The Presence:::::The ultimate moneymaking plan...buy the ancient, run-down Scottish castle and turn it into a tourist destination. Toni Fraser and her friends will put on reenactments combining fact and fiction, local history, murder and an imaginary laird named Bruce MacNiall. Just as someone arrives, claiming to actually be Laird MacNiall--a tall, dark, formidable Scot somehow familiar to Toni--the bodies of young women are found, dumped and forgotten in the nearby town. But even stranger, how is it possible this laird exists? Toni invented Bruce MacNiall for the performance...yet sinister, lifelike dreams suggest he's connected to the recent deaths. Bruce claims he wants to help catch the murderer. But even if she wants to, can Toni trust him...when her visions seem to be coming from within the very eyes of the killer himself?
