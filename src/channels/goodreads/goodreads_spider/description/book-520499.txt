520499:::::Toward a Global Civilization of Love and Tolerance:::::Using a basis of theoretical and cultural dynamics, this study explores dialogue, tolerance, different religions, cultures, and civilizations. This book has a double purpose. On the one hand, it is a call to Muslims to a greater awareness that Islam teaches the need for dialogue and that Muslims are called to be agents and witnesses to God's universal mercy. On the other hand, the book is an invitation to non-Muslims to move beyond prejudice, suspicion, and half-truths in order to arrive at an understanding of what Islam is really about.
