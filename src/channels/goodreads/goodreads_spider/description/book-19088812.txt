19088812:::::Tinted Lenses:::::Jack Conner is about to make his first big money doing the job he loves. The photography shoot of a fabulously wealthy Prince's wedding is going to earn him a fortune, but he reckons without the airline flying him to the ceremony in Brazil going bust. His only hope to keep the deal on track is to hire a private jet. A feisty but beautiful female passenger, a dodgy drug dealing pilot and two thousand miles of snake infested Amazon Rain Forest later, and Jack is beginning to regret ever agreeing to take pictures of the Royal nuptials. Anne Parsons is hoping that a round the world hiking trip will help her recover from the death of the love of her life. Marriage to a love sick Billionaire, an ill fated flight with an uncouth giant, and an unscheduled stopover in an mosquito ridden jungle, were not quite what she had in mind to lift the black depression that fills her days. Can Jack turn disaster into triumph and arrive at the wedding on time to earn himself fame and fortune or will his unexpectedly alluring travel companion be enough to convince him that the assignment is really not worth the money or the heartache? Will Anne be strong enough to stick to the ill concieved bargain she has made for a Billionaire's dollars or will resisting Jack's many hidden charms be too much for her to handle as they fight for survival on their journey through Equatorial Brazil? This is an easy read romantic adventure suitable for young adults upwards.
