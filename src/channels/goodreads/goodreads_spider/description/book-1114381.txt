1114381:::::Eyeshield 21, Vol. 6: Devil Bats Take Flight:::::The Devil Bats are going to feel like dancing for joy if they can beat Banba and his hulking team, the Taiyo Sphinx. Sena and crew have held their own in the first half, but they're going to have to come up with something really special to defeat this bunch of bruisers. And don't forget, the winner of this game gets to play against a championship team from the United States!
