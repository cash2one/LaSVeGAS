20446395:::::I Want You to Be My Second:::::I Want You to Be My Second is a short story collection about young people dating, hooking up, getting things wrong and trying to make them right. In his first book, John-Mark Davidson creates a less than perfect world of romance. The stories follow a handful of flawed characters from the confusing kisses of adolescence, through the blurry parties of college, to the this-isn't-where-I-thought-I-would-be mornings of adulthood. A newly-single man masters the science of picking up women in STD clinics. A college freshman's mistake prompts him to sneak off to North Dakota. And a traveling businessman neglects a multi-million-dollar crisis by stopping at a bar. Arrows whizz above a city. Lies are told. Truths are confessed. Consequences swell slowly. Lovers split, but never really leave. A dead man ascends. A young woman stumbles. And someone is hiding under the bed. I Want You to Be My Second is rich in emotion, snappy with dialogue and offers up as many jokes as it does heavy moments. This book is for everyone who didn't get it right the first time.
