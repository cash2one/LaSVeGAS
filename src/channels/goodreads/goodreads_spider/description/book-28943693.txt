28943693:::::Desperately Seeking Epic:::::Paul James loved Clara Bateman. Hating her would have been easier. She was the past, and he was hell-bent on keeping her there. Or so he thought... Craigslist Ad: DESPERATELY SEEKING EPIC You re my father. I don t know much about you. I know your name is Paul James, you re a thrill seeker, and once upon a time you did stunts and people called you Epic. I ve been told you don t know about me. That it s complicated. But for me it s simple. Here s the thing: I m twelve years old and I m dying. And as much as this could crush my mother, I have to meet you before I go. In time, I m sure she ll understand. She s still in love with you. So, Epic, if you read this, please come back. You don t have to be my dad. You don t even have to tell me you love me or you re sorry. Just come see me. Patiently waiting, but running out of time, Neena
