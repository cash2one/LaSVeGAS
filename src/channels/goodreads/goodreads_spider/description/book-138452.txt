Their quest now leads them to a world of magic and mysterious learning. Syaoran, the princess's young but fierce defender, is awestruck by this new world's enormous library. But when he opens one of the books, he is suddenly whisked away to a different dimension - a rough, barbaric place that resembles medieval Japan. There he witnesses the hardships faced by the family of a feudal lord who looks surprisingly like Syaoran's gruff companion Kurogane. Now Syaoran must figure out how he was transported...if he ever hopes to see Sakura again!
