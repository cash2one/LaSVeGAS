25806035:::::Beast Blood:::::Long after the great Michigan fires of 1881 have become cold ash, Gabrio s fated battle finally begins. Gabrio is a Beast Blood, transforming into a wolf by the light of the moon. He has found his life-mate, Esmeralda, and together they have discovered a measure of peace, a respite from the horrors of past. Living in modern-day Michigan, they hide their identities carefully from mortals and the dangers of half-breeds. But Gabrio s blood is bound to destiny. An ancient prophecy stirs the winds of fate around them, bringing signs of death and a blood moon. A Blood Taster, under oath to seek out the wicked in mortals, is now charged with doing the same among Beast Bloods and in so doing uncovers a truer sin that walks the earth, longing to take revenge against the punishment of God and using Gabrio and Esmeralda to do so. As the couple is drawn into a war between the angelic warriors of heaven and the demons of hell, they soon realize that they are destined to play a major role in the outcome of the conflict and that the prophecy heralds the coming of the ultimate power, known as the Hybrid. From the woods of Michigan to the emerald-green highlands of Scotland, this second volume of the Beast Blood series follows two supernatural creatures as they stand witness to an apocalyptic battle between good and evil.
