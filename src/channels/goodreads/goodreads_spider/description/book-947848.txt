947848:::::The Making of the English Working Class:::::This account of artisan &amp; working-class society in its formative years, 1780-1832, adds an important dimension to our understanding of the 19th century. E.P. Thompson shows how the working class took part in its own making &amp; recreates the whole life experience of people who suffered loss of status &amp; freedom, who underwent degradation &amp; who yet created a culture &amp; political consciousness of great vitality. "Thompson's book has been called controversial, but perhaps only because so many have forgotten how explosive England was during the Regency &amp; the early reign of Victoria. Without any reservation, The Making of the English Working Class is the most important study of those days since the classic work of the Hammonds."-- Commentary "Mr Thompson's deeply human imagination &amp; controlled passion help us to recapture the agonies, heroisms &amp; illusions of the working class as it made itself. No one interested in the history of the English people should fail to read his book."-- Times Literary Supplement
