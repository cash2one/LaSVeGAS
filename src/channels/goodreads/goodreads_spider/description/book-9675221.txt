Then in La Jill Hunt s Seven Year Itch, sassy, full-figured Avery Frederick was woman enough to win the eye of the sexiest dude on the block and was even able to convert bad-boy hustler Duke to a life of true love and near-legitimacy. But seven years later, Duke hasn t fully transformed into the man Avery s tried to make him become. On top of that, she s starting to feel a stirring for her attractive coworker, Vaughn.
