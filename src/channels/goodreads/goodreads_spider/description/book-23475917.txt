23475917:::::Shades:::::Shades hadn t seen Skylar in years, and now here she was, the love of his life, riding back into his life on the back of a brother s bike. For years after Shades had lost Skylar, he d tried satisfying the emptiness of losing her with booze, pussy and the club. He d turned his frustration at having to give her up into a determination to climb the ranks of the club, but he hadn t counted on the fact that the pull he d felt toward Skylar had only laid dormant in him all these years. Or that all it would take to reignite it was just one look at her. And he sure as hell hadn t counted on her showing up on the back of a brother s bike. When Skylar finally comes back into his life, will his desire for earning that VP patch stand in the way of any future he could have with her? And when a rival MC shows up looking for Skylar, things go from complicated to damn near impossible. Does Skylar come with more baggage than Shades is willing to sign up for?
