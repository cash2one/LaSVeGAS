12690982:::::A Storm of Swords:::::The Seven Kingdoms are divided by revolt and blood feud as winter approaches like an angry beast. Of the five contenders for power, one is dead, another in disfavour, and still the wars rage as violently as ever, as alliances are made and broken. Beyond the Wall, a horde of hungry, savage people steeped in the dark magic of the wilderness is poised to invade. Yet with King of the North Robb Stark's defences ranged against the South the land of the cunning and cruel Lannisters he must bend to the will of an old tyrant if he is to hold his crown. And while his youngest sister Arya may have escaped the clutches of the depraved Cersei Lannister and her son, Sansa Stark remains their unwilling captive. Meanwhile, across the ocean, Daenerys Targaryen, the last heir of the Dragon king, delivers death to the slave-trading cities of Astapor and Yunkai, as she approaches Westeros with vengeance in her heart. Throughout Westeros the war for the Iron Throne rages more fiercely than ever, but if the Wall is breached, no king will live to claim it.
