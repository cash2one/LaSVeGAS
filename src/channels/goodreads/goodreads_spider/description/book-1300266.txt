1300266:::::Godly Inspirations for the Troubled Soul:::::This book is a compilation of prose and poetry that I have written over the last twenty years. THese are all stories that are relevant to my life and hopefully will bring you as much peace and contentment as they have brought me. All these stories are of a spiritual nature and have helped me define my life as a christian. I will be also publishing a collection of general prose and poetry in the near future.
