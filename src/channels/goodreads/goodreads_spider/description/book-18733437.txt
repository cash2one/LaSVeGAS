18733437:::::Once Upon a Haunted Moon:::::Magic, ghosts and legend link the past to the present in this second installment of the Keeper Saga. The year is 1765 when eight-year old Eleanor Brown begins the fatal journey that leaves her orphaned. Befriended by a wolf, and adopted by an Indian tribe, Ella soon learns to believe in the magic around her. Though she grows up to find a love that will endure all time, she must also find the courage to live without that love when the Fire Witch returns. When history falls into legends nearly forgotten, the Keepers must search for the truth and find the answers before the same evil that nearly destroyed their people comes back for her revenge. Will the power of The Wolf be enough to save them... Or will the fate of their ancestors be their own destiny?
