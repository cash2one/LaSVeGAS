21035657:::::Goodbye, Piccadilly: War at Home, 1914:::::Set against the real events of 1914, the first book in an exciting new series from Cynthia Harrod-Eagles is extraordinary in scope and imagination In 1914, Britain faces a new kind of war. For Edward and Beatrice Hunter, their children, servants, and neighbors, life will never be the same again. For David, the eldest, war means a chance to do something noble; but enlisting will break his mother's heart. His sister Diana, 19 and beautiful, longs for marriage. She has her heart set on Charles Wroughton, son of Earl Wroughton, but Charles will never be allowed to marry a banker's daughter. Below stairs, Cook and Ada, the head housemaid, grow more terrified of German invasion with every newspaper atrocity story. Ethel, under housemaid, can't help herself when it comes to men and now soldiers add to the temptation; yet there's more to this flighty girl than meets the eye. The once-tranquil village of Northcote reels under an influx of khaki volunteers, wounded soldiers, and Belgian refugees. The war is becoming more dangerous and everyone must find a way to adapt to this rapidly changing world.
