17283469:::::Blacksnow Zero:::::While investigating the murder of a prominent Senator, FBI Agent Erica Blake uncovers a drastic, top-secret operation. A group of rogue American generals are planning a ruthless attack on China, as a way to free the U.S. from the crushing debt the country owes the Chinese. Named Operation BlackSnow, the plan will be carried out without the knowledge of Congress or the public. Realizing the attack could plunge the U.S. into a world war, Erica tries to stop it.

Suspecting involvement by the FBI Director in BlackSnow, she enlists the help of her ex-lover, CIA Agent Steve McCord. Not knowing who to trust, Erica and Steve battle deadly black ops assassins, corrupt Senators, and their own complicit agencies in their attempt to stop BlackSnow. Do they succeed, or is the planet plunged into a world war?
