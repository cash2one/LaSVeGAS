37786729:::::The Shaman's Apprentice:::::Her master calls her shaman. Her people call her witch. Gods, spirits, and demons won't stop calling. In this first book of B. Muze's epic primitive fantasy, Yaku Shaman believes he has at last found his apprentice a girl who talks with ghosts, spirits and gods with equal ease. Unfortunately, his people refuse to accept her. The shaman forces Jovai to sacrifice every hope of a normal life, until the people, unaware of the dangers threatening them, revolt. Barely escaping both her people and their enemies, rejected by the spirits, having failed her master, Jovai must find her way in a war-torn world full of deadly threats, both human and supernatural. --- "Hauntingly lyrical and compelling. A fascinating blend of earthy and other worldly. This story will break your heart and make your spirits soar. Couldn t put it down. Still awestruck long after I finished reading it. More. Must have more!" - Claudia Rodriguez, El Corriente
