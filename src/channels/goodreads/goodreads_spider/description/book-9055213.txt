9055213:::::The Payback:::::Dennis Milne is a man with a past, and a past that involves murder. A former cop, he's earned his living killing the bad guys -- drug-dealers, corrupt business men -- people who, in his opinion, deserve to die. For the past two days, he's been in Manila, waiting for his next target: a young woman who's made herself some poor life-choices, and some even worse enemies. DI Tina Boyd is a woman on a mission. Tough, spiky and determined, she's looking for the man she holds responsible for the death of her lover. She knows he's ruthless. She knows he's dangerous. But he's in Manila, and she's determined to find and kill him -- before he kills her. Two cops with pasts that haunt them -- and a present that could see them both dead. They are about to meet. And when they do, it's payback time. From the Trade Paperback edition.
