With the King murdered and the Black Wolves disbanded, Kellas lives as an exile far from the palace he once guarded with his life. Until Marshal Dannarah, sister to the dead King, comes to him with a plea-rejoin the palace guard and save her nephew, King Jehosh, before he meets his father's fate. Combining the best of Shogun and Netflix's Marco Polo , Black Wolves is an unmissable treat for epic fantasy lovers everywhere.
