She also could not have predicted adopting Charlie, an orphaned coyote pup. In a world where coyotes are hunted as killers, Stockton and Charlie have faced challenges-as well as joys-throughout their first year. Operating Instructions meets Marley and Me in this charming life-lesson book about life, love, and the bond between humans and nature.The Daily Coyote was inspired by Stockton's blog of the same name. Wildly popular and praised by Rosie O'Donnell, James Wolcott of Vanity Fair, and the Los Angeles Times, the site receives over a million hits per month and was nominated for a 2007 Weblog of the Year Award only a month after its inception. Numerous media outlets, from People to NPR, can't wait to feature Stockton and Charlie.
