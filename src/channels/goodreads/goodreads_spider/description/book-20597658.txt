20597658:::::The 'Fishy' Adventures of Gus, Toby and Tootoo: Big Tale 1:::::Let me introduce myself... I'm Gus, the most handsome (so they say) rainbow trout in Captain Cove. Life is grand in the river, just swimming along and munching the odd caddis fly. Not to say that my life revolves around eating - I do have some other interests too! Although I do love food! My best friend is TooToo, a pretty golden carp. She makes me laugh, but she has a little problem. I won't say what as she might be listening and I don't want to embarrass her, but it has to do with green bubbles and it surprised my little spider friend. In Big Tale 1 of my Fishy Adventures, I meet a new swimmer on the block - a really talkative brook trout, who is a little annoying. I think he wants to look like me because I sparkle and I reckon he might have a little crush on TooToo. Will we become friends - let's find out... Meanwhile, TooToo hears some gossip about some treasure... but is it really real?
