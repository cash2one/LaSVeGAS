490667:::::Sport: A Novel:::::A nostalgic story about a Minnesota boy's search for belonging in a complex world. "In this wise, witty story set in West St. Paul in the '60s, a kid named Harlan navigates life by focusing on the Twins baseball team, a comic metaphor for hope. Sport is fat with small pleasures. It is a homer and a gift to all of us grownup knothole-game kids. There's a lot to love in this quiet little book, most of all its subtle wisdom about establishing individuality and finding joy amid chaos--in short, aboutgrowing up."
