1257963:::::Rescuing Rose:::::Who does an advice columnist ask for help? Thirty-six-ish, well, thirty-eight . . . no, actually, thirty-nine-year-old advice columnist Rose Costelloe thought she'd solved all her problems when she got married after a whirlwind two-month courtship. But seven months and an extremely public smash-up later (embarrassing, when you dole out relationship wisdom for a living), things are looking thorny for Rose. Her job's in jeopardy, her finances are in shambles and she's being plagued by a stalker who seems to know rather a lot about the mysterious circumstances of her birth. Sometimes rescue comes from an unexpected source . . . Her zany friends suggest she get a roommate, and at first Theo, a geeky accountant, seems like the perfect choice for resolutely single Rose. Soon, however, she's seeing stars -- Theo has a secret passion for astronomy . . . and he might just be fond of his prickly redheaded landlady, as well. Will Rose be able to chart her own course? From the bestselling author of The Trials of Tiffany Trott , The Making of Minty Malone , and Out of the Blue comes a tale of star-crossed lovers who, though they live under the same roof, might as well be on different planets.
