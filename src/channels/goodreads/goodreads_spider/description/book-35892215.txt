35892215:::::The Son of Saint Death:::::Drifting across America with no goal, I answer a request to solve a gruesome murder. But like Pandora's box, I uncovered monsters that history has forgotten. Unleashing the worse on this once mighty nation. There is no hope for saving what was once lost. No hope of bringing life to a rotten corpse. All I can do is protect the ones I love. While I pray to our Holy Death to bathe in my enemies blood.
