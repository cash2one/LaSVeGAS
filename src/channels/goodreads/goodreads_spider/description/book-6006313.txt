6006313:::::Kept:::::Ethan and Derek Taggart: they're the men of Gemini, and when it comes to sheet-scorching undercover work, nobody does it better. The only one they answer to is big brother Danny--that is, until the right women come along to grab the reins and crack the whip as hard as the Taggart men like it. . . Security is Derek Taggart's game, and he plays it straight--no margin for error, no time to fool around. . .except with one hot little number who changes everything. He takes her home when she needs a ride--one she'll never forget. The problem is Derek can't forget her, a total about-face for a guy who keeps his enemies closer than his lovers. Then he finds out the sexy dynamo is Alyssa Miles, notorious party girl and darling of the gossip rags. It's time to walk away and never look back, which would be a hell of a lot easier if his agency didn't desperately need the high-profile gig her family's offering: a minor detail that consists mainly of Derek watching Alyssa 24/7. Keeping an eagle eye on every inch of Alyssa's nubile body isn't exactly a hardship--the problem is keeping his hands off and his brain on when things go dangerously wrong. . .
