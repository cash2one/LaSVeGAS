20976417:::::Take One with You:::::MURDER GOES VIRAL! They meet in an online chatroom dealing with depression and soon hatch a plan to bring meaning to their lives by encouraging other despondent individuals to help eradicate the "scum of society," such as pedophiles and rapists who have escaped justice. Anyone dead set on committing suicide is urged to first kill someone who "got away with it" before taking their own life. Why not, they ask, "take one with you?" The idea goes viral and things rapidly spiral out of control. As they develop romantic feelings for each other, their worldwide followers begin to enact a very different version of the idea, perverting its original intent and threatening the thin line between civil society and criminal anarchy. Just as they find hope of happiness together, Charlie and Sarah must deal with the monster they've created, a global epidemic of murder-suicide that threatens the very core of their humanity. Take One With You is a unique crime thriller/millennial love story that poses the question: If you knew you were going to die tomorrow, would you kill someone tonight? Someone who had done something terrible. Someone who deserved to die. If so, who would it be? If you couldn't do it, what about your neighbor? Your friend? Your enemy? Who draws the line? Who decides who lives and who dies? And what if we all began to take justice into our own hands?
