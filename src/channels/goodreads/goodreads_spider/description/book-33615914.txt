33615914:::::With Us:::::More than just a dimpled smile and chiseled jaw, Theo Amato s quick-thinking and bold confidence made him successful. Heavy responsibilities left time for close friends and family, but nothing more. It wasn t until he looked into a pair of big green eyes that his focus changed. Full lips, a gorgeous face, and an endearing personality had him hooked from the start. There was nothing Dahlia Kincaid enjoyed more than a good book, a funny movie, and a full night s sleep. Long workdays meant she rarely had time for any of them, but the sacrifice was worth it to live in the city. It wasn t until she met a man with model good looks and sexy veined hands that her life changed in ways she'd never even known to dream of. Wickedly sweet, Theo gently and strategically pulled Dahlia from her rut, handing her the world in the process. But shadows play tricks on the eyes, and life wasn t always what it seemed. With them It was better. Warning: Recommended for readers 18+ due to adult content, language, and situations.
