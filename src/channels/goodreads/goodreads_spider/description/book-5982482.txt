5982482:::::The Pillow Book of Lotus Lowenstein:::::Lotus Lowenstein's life is merde . She dreams of moving to Paris and becoming an existentialist. Yet here she is trapped in Park Slope, Brooklyn, with a New-Agey mom, an out-of-work dad, and a chess champion brother who dreams of being a rock star. Merci Dieu for Lotus s best friend, Joni, who loves French culture enough to cofound their high school s first French Club with Lotus. At the first meeting, the cutest boy in the world walks in. His name is Sean, and he too loves French culture and worships Jean-Paul Sartre. At first, Lotus thinks Sean is the best thing to happen to her in years. He s smart, cultured, and adorable. Unfortunately, though, Joni feels the same way. And having an existentialist view of love, Sean sees nothing wrong with enjoying both girls affections. Things come to a head when all three depart for Montreal with their teacher, Ms. G, on the French Club s first official field trip. Will Sean choose Joni over Lotus? And will Lotus and Joni s friendship ever recover?
