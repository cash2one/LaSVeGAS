28268831:::::Kage:::::Librarian's Note: this is an alternate cover edition - ISBN 10: 1512341606 My name is Jamie Atwood, and I m an addict. I never thought I d say such a thing. Never had a problem being overly-attached to anything in my life. I came from a perfectly middle-class family, made good grades, and had a hot cheerleader girlfriend... but the truth is, nothing ever really moved me. So how did a guy like me become an addict? I met Michael Kage. Kage is an MMA fighter. A famous one. I like to think I helped him get that way. He s charming as hell, with looks to rival any movie star and talent to back it up. So why did he need to hire me as an intern Publicist? Simple. He has a darkness in him like a black hole so deep it could swallow him, and me, and everyone we know and that s not good for business. The first time I met him, I felt the pull. I think the addiction began at that very moment. And even if I d known then what I know now, I would have fallen for him. How could I not? For me, Kage is everything.
