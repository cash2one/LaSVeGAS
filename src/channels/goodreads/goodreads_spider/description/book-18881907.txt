18881907:::::Who We Are:::::Eight months. That s how long it s been since Eliza last saw Gage and they both feel as if they don t deserve one another s forgiveness. He screwed up. She walked away without looking back. They ll try and make up all the time they ve lost with one another, that is until they re facing the choices of either going their separate ways, or hanging on and fighting for dear life. The fights will be endless. They heartache will be real. The demons will return, and they won t back down without a fight. There are some who will do anything to keep true love apart, and those same people will dig deep into their demonic ways until Eliza and Gage are literally no more. Can Eliza and Gage overcome it all? Will they be able to face the true demons that are seeking to destroy them? Or will they just forget about everything they ve worked so hard for and go their separate ways? Sometimes you have to go through struggles in order to reach an ultimate point of peace but will their struggle be worth it? *Recommended for ages 18+*
