13139660:::::God Bless You, Mr. Vonnegut:::::Few authors have had as much influence on the youth of America than Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. He brought morality and humanism to the forefront of millions of minds and into the mind of one man in particular. Author, documentary filmmaker, and longtime Huffington Post contributor, Bryan Young has been a lifelong fan and student of Vonnegut's. God Bless You, Mr. Vonnegut is his love letter to the late writer, collecting essays, short stories, and other material written over the last ten years, all of it about, or directly inspired by, Vonnegut. From Huffington Post: Young displays here both his depth as a writer and passion for the art itself-much of which he traces back to Kurt Vonnegut. In a chapter devoted to teachers, Young recounts both experiences in his own public schooling and his feelings for Vonnegut as a passive teacher of sorts. Young also touches on the incredibly personal and political, recounting painful dealings with the US "health care system." There's a little bit of everything in here. And something for everyone. And at $3.99, it's hard to go wrong.
