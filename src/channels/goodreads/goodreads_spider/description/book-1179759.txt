1179759:::::The Pretenders:::::When the rakish young Baron Reeve of Ormsby loses his shirt in a horse race, he asks his conservative uncle, the Lord Bradford, to give him access to his inheritance. The Lord agrees--if the young Baron will marry to add some stability to his life. Reeve enlists his childhood pal, Deborah, to "marry" him with the understanding that they will call off the wedding before the actual day arrives. They also promise to never, ever fall in love. But some promises were made to be broken.
