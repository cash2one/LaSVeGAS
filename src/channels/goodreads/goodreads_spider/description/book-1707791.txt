1707791:::::All The Rivers Run:::::A WOMAN IN A MAN'S WORLD Her handsome, laughing cousin Adam gave young Delie Gordon her first taste of love--its soaring happiness, its heartbreaking pain. Virile, self-confident riverboat captain Brenton Edwards showed Delie her weakness in the face of a man's overwhelming passion--but though he made her his wife, he could not enslave her proud and defiant spirit. Wealthy and elegant Alastair Raeburn taught Delie how sweet forbidden ecstasy could be--and how high its ultimate price. Here is a spellbinding story of a beautiful and vital woman--the man she loved, the children she bore, the dreams she followed, and the destiny she found. Here, set against the lush, wild countryside and winding rivers of Victorian Australia, is a saga that surges over eight dramatic decades and four generations.
