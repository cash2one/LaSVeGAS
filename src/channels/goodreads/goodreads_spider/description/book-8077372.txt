Portia finds herself tangled up in a web of lies and deceit in another's quest for demonic power in the excitingly romantic second paranormal novel in the Of Witches and Warlocks Series, The Demon Kiss. 5 out of 5 Stars "The author has written it in such a way that you sigh, you laugh, you cheer, you cringe, you cry right along side with the characters and to me that's an essential element to a good story. I loved the storyline of The Demon Kiss and how the author introduces twists you never see coming. This is definitely not a boring read and its one that will keep you up all night reading frantically because you can't bare to put it down for a second."
