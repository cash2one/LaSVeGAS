23365873:::::His Secretary: Undone:::::I m about to throw an ashtray at my boss s head. Turns out, the mind behind my favorite, steamy romance novels...the ones I only read in private...the ones that are my only escape after a long day of dealing with The Boss From Hell? It s not Natalie McBride, the sweet, rural housewife. It s him. That s right: my boss, Adrian Risinger, the thirty-three-year-old, maddeningly sexy, pissant billionaire bad boy" who thinks he runs my life. He is also the author of all my deepest, most secret fantasies. And to make matters worse, he needs me to impersonate Natalie at a series of book signings and conventions. But, of course, that s only if I want to keep my job. On second thought, I m going to need something heavier than an ashtray.
