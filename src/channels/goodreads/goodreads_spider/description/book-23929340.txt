23929340:::::Go Away Girl: A Parody:::::On a warm summer morning in Frayser, Tennessee, it is Rick and Winnie Dunce s fifth wedding anniversary. Presents aren't actually being wrapped nor are reservations really being made when Rick s somewhat brilliant, yet borderline psychotic wife, vanishes. Husband-of-the-Year Rick isn t doing himself any favors with troubling fantasies about opening up his wife s skull (Hannibal Lecter style) or his wholly inappropriate joke at his missing wife's news conference. Passages from Winnie's diary expose just how completely out of her mind she really is. The super-annoying perfectionist with her inane treasure hunt clues and bizarre quiz questions could have put anyone precariously on edge. I mean, if he did kill her, can you really blame him? Under growing pressure from the cops and the media as well as Winnie s weird and selfishly preoccupied parents the suspect/husband dispenses a continuous series of lies, deceptions, and inappropriate behavior. Rick is strangely evasive, kind of dumb and he s certainly hostile but is he really a killer? Formerly titled, So Far Gone Girl, this hilarious parody of GONE GIRL, the most intense and acclaimed thriller of the decade, will leave you doubled over with laughter, gasping for breath and checking to see if your own ottoman can really balance on its side like that.
