7944608:::::The Morganville Vampires, Volume 2:::::During the day, Morganville is just a small college town in the heart of Texas. But after dark, students like Claire Danvers know that studying can take a backseat to staying alive. Now together in one bloodthirsty volume, the second two books of the Morganville Vampires series show why underestimating a vampire can be deadly.... MIDNIGHT ALLEY Claire Danvers has pledged herself to Amelie, the most powerful vampire in town. But being under Amelie's protection doesn't offer much comfort when people start turning up dead, a talker resurfaces from Claire's past, and an ancient bloodsucker extends a chilling invitation for private lessons at his secluded home in Midnight Alley. To what end, Claire will soon discover - and it will give a terrifying new meaning to night school. FEAST OF FOOLS In Morganville, vampires and humans have learned to live in relative peace, but the tenuous good-neighbor policy is abruptly turned on its head with the arrival of Mr. Bishop. The ancient old-school vampire is bad to the bones, and what he wants from the town's living and dead is unthinkably sinister. It's only at a formal ball attended by vampires and their human dates that Claire realizes Bishop's plan - and the elaborately evil trap he's set for the warm-blooded souls of Morganville.
