His decision to stay with Aaric, knowing full well that his presence might change all of history, brings him to the very edge of reality. But his colleagues who have returned to the 25th century have other plans. They intend to bring him back before he changes anything, even if it means killing him. But first they have to find him. Traveling along the Wilderness Trail with his new companion, Kallen is totally unaware he's being stalked. In the meantime, he realizes what had been missing his whole life, deepens his love with Aaric, and sees more water than he thought possible. Slowly but surely, he recognizes that he has more to offer than he ever knew. In fact, he may even be able to shape the future that should have been! But Kallen learns an even more important lesson. He discovers that love knows no boundaries--not even of time itself.
