4834391:::::Melody's Song:::::Melody Haney has an angelic singing voice, but denies the gift after her son dies. Out of obligation, when she is asked to sing to hospitalized children she agrees. Accused of stealing drugs from the oncology unit she pushes away the one man who would stand by her. Dr. Devon Siegal, pediatric oncologist, doesn't believe in coincidences. Even when faced with evidence that could damn her, he continues to believe in Melody's innocence. He has faith she will tell him everything and love will prevail.
