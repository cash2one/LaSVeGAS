Darci Shelton is compelled to help a woman reclaim her rightful name and possible inheritance, which means uncovering dark family secrets someone may have killed to keep hidden. She gets a letter addressed to Addie Brown, the ghost who haunts Petal Pushers flower shop. Turns out a deathbed confession prompted Ellen to write in hopes that somebody in the small Kentucky town might know what happened all those years ago, when her great-grandmother, Betsy, went on the run with newborn twins. What happened to Betsy's husband, and why did she hide behind an alias the rest of her life? When Darci starts asking questions, she snoops her way into legal trouble. She's already struggling to overcome financial problems in the shop, so that's the last thing she needs. Miss Addie is eager to help, especially since Betsy was her BFF, but a dead lady can only do so much. Darci must solve the mystery in time . . . without falling victim to the cover-up.
