7203725:::::Juni:::::A visit from the Queen, a tragic accident, a divided family: a masterful new novel from the prize-winning Gerbrand Bakker. On a summer's day, June 17th 1969, everyone is gathered in front of the Polderhuis to welcome Queen Juliana. The young sons of farmer Kaan wave their flags enthusiastically. Just as the monarch is getting into her car to leave, their mother and little Hanne arrive late -- the Queen strokes the little girl's cheek and regally offers Anna Kaan her hand. It would have been an unforgettable day of celebration if only the baker hadn't been running late with his deliveries and knocked down little Hanne, playing on the roadside, with his brand-new VW van. Years later Jan Kaan arrives from the island of Texel on a hot day in June in order to tidy his sister's grave, and is overcome again with grief and silent fury. Isn't it finally time to get to the bottom of things? Should the permit for the grave be extended again? And why won't anyone explain to his little niece Dieke why grandma has been lying on hay in the shed for a day and a half nursing a bottle of eggnog and refusing to see anyone?
