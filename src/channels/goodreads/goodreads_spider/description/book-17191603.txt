17191603:::::The Case Book of Irene Adler:::::When Irene Adler, Holmes and Moriarty meet, the result will be mighty explosive! Ruthless? Depraved? Criminal? This is how Irene Adler, the Woman , has been portrayed by Dr Watson in the chronicles of Sherlock Holmes. In this case book, she will have the chance to tell her own story for the first time. When, as an impoverished actress, her most precious possession is stolen, she vows to get it back, at any cost. And so she does, and gets away with the villain s wallet for good measure. This is the first of her misdeeds, and it leads to a chain of others... some minor, some less so... She teams up with some other like-minded bohemians, and together they create the Club des As, the Aces Club. They aren t mere criminals but rather Equalisers! Campaigners against the Idle Rich and other parasites! They embark upon a number of ventures: stealing a diamond from a fraudulent Countess; walking off with the Pre-Raphaelite artist Millais latest masterpiece from under the very nose of Sherlock Holmes... But as well as these ambitious thefts, they put their skills to use in defending the rights of those that the forces of the Law in Victorian Britain ignore... such as the Gipsy family whose children are disappearing... When Irene s gay friend, Lord Clarihoe is blackmailed by an ex-lover, she hoodwinks Holmes in court, where he has been summoned as an expert on Graphology. Sometimes, her schemes put her in danger, as when King Sigsmund of Bohemia plots to have her killed, and she has to take the unexpected action of teaming up with her nemesis Sherlock Holmes. Though they started as enemies, Irene also helps Holmes solve many cases, such as the mystery of the Red-Headed League. When the evil Professor Moriarty enters the scene, and lures them to the Reichenbach Falls, both the Woman and the Great Detective will be fighting for their lives.
