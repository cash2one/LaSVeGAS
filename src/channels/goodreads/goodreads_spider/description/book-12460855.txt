12460855:::::Grl2grl 2: Short Fictions:::::Readers are immersed into the minds and hearts of lesbian, bisexual, transgender, gay, queer, and questioning young people in this new collection of short fictions, grl2grl 2. Stories will be available for download one at a time until the collection is complete. In the first story, "Give Me a D", a young lesbian's need to hide and lie about her sexuality spills over into every aspect of her life as bitterness and blame. The second story, "Her Secret Life" shows a different perspective of coming out to family as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. The third story, "Blessings and Miracles," is a seasonal story of love, joy, giving and receiving.
