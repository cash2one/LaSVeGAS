The time is now for Americans to make their voices heard through the informed vote. Byron Goines has created a powerful audiobook addressing both political parties. This audiobook explains the progressive ideology of today's Democratic Party, the regressive ideology of today's Republican Party, and gives the history behind each ideology as it relates to the history of both political parties. Byron Goines irrefutably proves progressive ideology is the engine that drives forward momentum, and has contributed significantly to positive gains throughout the history of the United States of America. Various historical political figures are addressed, as they relate to the history of both political parties. The issue of the importance of a Democrat controlled Congress is addressed in detail. Republican obstruction concerning issues of importance to the American people, are addressed in detail. Byron Goines has framed this audiobook as "The 2014 Battle Cry for Progressives", as the 2014 midterm elections will be a battle for the removal of Republican Congressional obstruction. This audiobook informs all listeners about the seriousness of this election, as a Democrat controlled Senate and House of Representatives is necessary in order to end Republican obstruction. 2014 Gubernatorial elections are also addressed in this audiobook. Republican Governor's throughout the United States have rejected the Medicaid expansion of the Affordable Care Act, which has cost their states additional economic stimulation and left their poor citizens without coverage. The 2014 midterm elections are an opportunity for change, and Byron Goines explains the importance of that change.
