276477:::::Apocalypse Culture:::::TWO THOUSAND YEARS have passed since the death of Christ and the world is going mad. Nihilist prophets, born-again pornographers, transcendental schizophrenics and just plain folks are united in their belief in an imminent global catastrophe. What are the forces lurking behind this mass delirium? APOCALYPSE CULTURE is a startling, absorbing and exhaustive tour through the nether regions of today s psychotic brainscape. First published in 1987, APOCALYPSE CULTURE immediately touched a nerve.
