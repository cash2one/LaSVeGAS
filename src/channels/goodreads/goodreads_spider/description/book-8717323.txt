8717323:::::Room:::::From Emma Donoghue, the Irish author of Slammerkin and Hood, Room describes the heartbreaking story of Jack and his Ma - who live in a single, locked room with no key. Jack loves watching his cartoon character 'friends' on TV, but knows that nothing he sees on screen is truly real - only him, Ma and the things in the room. Told from Jack's viewpoint as he prepares to celebrate his fifth birthday, Donoghue lets you feel his anguish as Ma admits there is a world outside those four walls. Shortlisted for the Man Booker prize and compared to The Lovely Bones, Room takes a profoundly affecting look at motherly love.
