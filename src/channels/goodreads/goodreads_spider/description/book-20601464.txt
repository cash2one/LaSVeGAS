20601464:::::First Moon:::::Audrey Levine, thinks being bitten by a wolf is just another day on the job. She couldn t be more wrong... A wildlife rehabilitation specialist, Audrey usually does all the rescuing, but now she's the one who needs help. In ten days, she ll be covered in fur and howling at the moon while the werewolf who bit her is out there waiting to claim her as his own...whether she wants to be his or not. The biggest problem? The curvy beauty doesn t know any of this. Werewolf, Tao Black, is the strong, silent type, which is an asset in his role as pack enforcer. Hot on the trail of a wolf gone bad, he runs into trouble and is saved by Audrey. Realizing her situation, he vows to protect Audrey from the wolf who bit her, no matter what it takes. But that means going against his alpha s orders and that might get them both killed.
