23174415:::::Nick Nightmare Investigates:::::In this frenetic collection of stories taken from the files of Nick Nightmare, Private Eye, the intrepid pulp hero is thrown into a murky world of crawling horrors, spawned by the Old Ones as they seek to rise up from their primordial oceanic depths, when the stars are right. Whether he is shooting it out with power-crazed acolytes in his native New York, or slipping across into other dimensions to battle the spreading plague of invasion, Nightmare is never far from the long, clammy reach of the things from the Deep, bizarre artifacts of power, decrepit villages and citadels, magic and voodoo. Life for the private eye is an endless slalom of mayhem. Nick Nightmare Investigates includes a team-up with Damian Paladin in a brand new, full-blooded action thriller, written in collaboration with Mike Chinn. Nick Nightmare Investigates is a potent blend of HP Lovecraft, Mickey Spillane and the roller coaster adventures of the golden age of the pulps.
