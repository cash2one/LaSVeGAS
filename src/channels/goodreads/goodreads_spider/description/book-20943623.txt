20943623:::::Be My December:::::I knew the exact moment I d become a yes girl. December 16th, a cold winter s night, four years ago. The night my innocence was stolen, the night I made the mistake of saying no a mistake I d never make again. The dream of a happily ever after' was now a locked away myth. I promised myself that I d never return to the place of my worst nightmare, that I d never let anyone get close, but then again, I never thought I d meet someone like him. The intense, confident and beautiful Ky Crawford. I had no plans to become someone s Prince Charming. I couldn t be. I refused to be. My plan was simple do whatever it takes to correct my biggest mistake, my one regret that now controlled my life. I was on track. I had plans, but then everything changed when I saw her the girl in the red jacket, the girl who I was told couldn t say no. The reserved yet stunning Eden Rivers. A girl who can t say no. A guy who craves redemption. A chance encounter? It all comes down to this. One question. One month. Be My December?
