13238290:::::Second Person Singular:::::Acclaimed novelist Sayed Kashua, the creator of the groundbreaking Israeli sitcom, Arab Labor, has been widely praised for his literary eye and deadpan wit. His new novel is considered internationally to be his most accomplished and entertaining work yet. Winner of the prestigious Bernstein Award, Second Person Singular centers on an ambitious lawyer who is considered one of the best Arab criminal attorneys in Jerusalem. He has a thriving practice in the Jewish part of town, a large house, speaks perfect Hebrew, and is in love with his wife and two young children. One day at a used bookstore, he picks up a copy of Tolstoy s The Kreutzer Sonata, and inside finds a love letter, in Arabic, in his wife s handwriting. Consumed with suspicion and jealousy, the lawyer hunts for the book s previous owner a man named Yonatan pulling at the strings that hold all their lives together. With enormous emotional power, and a keen sense of the absurd, Kashua spins a tale of love and betrayal, honesty and artifice, and questions whether it is possible to truly reinvent ourselves. Second Person Singular is a deliciously complex psychological mystery and a searing dissection of the individuals that comprise a divided society.
