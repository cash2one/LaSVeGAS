1251838:::::Red Sails to Capri:::::The minute he saw the boat with the red sails moving into the harbor, Michele knew that something exciting was going to happen. It was the biggest and most beautiful ship fourteen-year-old Michele had ever seen. Sailing on the ship were three men who would come to stay at Michele's parents' inn. The men said they were searching - one for beauty, one for adventure, and one for "something difficult to explain." What they brought with them was a mystery and adventure that would change Michele's life - and all of Capri - forever.
