Chirya, a young girl of 8 years old, is not quite satisfied with this arrangement.

And in the real life game of chess, Chirya is about to do just that make the queen the most important player. Aks (English: Reflection) is a story of struggle, of injustice, of childhood traumas and life s crippling hurdles. It is a story of courage, of resilience, of not bowing down, and standing up each time you fall flat on your face. Aks appeared in Pakeeza Digest from August 2011 to December 2012.
