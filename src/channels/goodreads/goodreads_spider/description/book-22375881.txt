22375881:::::Donal's Mountain: How One Son Inspired a Nation:::::It's not often you sit beside a sixteen-year-old boy and feel in the presence of greatness but that's what it was like for me with Donal Walsh' Paul O'Connell, rugby player 'Donal Walsh was able to see the beauty in life. He spent his valuable time helping us to open our eyes' Cecelia Ahern, author Sixteen-year-old Donal Walsh came to national attention when he spoke out about suicide in young people in an RT television interview and, later, in an article which appeared in a national newspaper. At the time, Donal was dying of cancer. He wanted others to see that death is never an answer. A few short weeks later, on 12 May 2013, Donal sadly passed away. Here, in this heart-breaking but ultimately inspirational memoir - written by his father and including Donal's own words - we are given an insight into an extraordinary young man who, in coming to terms with his own death, became determined to open people's eyes to the beauty that surrounds them in life. All Donal asked before he died was that his parents continue to spread the message of living life. This is Donal's legacy.
