26070309:::::Beauty and the Biker:::::I had four weeks before I shipped out again so it was sun, fun, and partying hard. She wasn't a part of the plan. We had one perfect month together before I had to go wheels up. Neither of us expected what happened next. The blast left me scarred, inside and out. How could I ever be good enough for a beauty like her? She deserved better. Now I've got the Ghost Riders Motorcycle Club, and I don't need anything else. If I can't have her, I'll never have another. A man can live without his heart...right? Abraham has one regret letting his Julie get away. When he can't let go, there's only one thing left to do. Make her his. Warning: If you want a scarred hero who's over-the-top obsessed, alpha possessive, and falls in love at first sight, take a peek inside. *Not responsible if peek turns into a full-on read.*
