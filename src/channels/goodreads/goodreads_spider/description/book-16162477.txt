16162477:::::Les Miserables:::::"Jean Valjean, my brother, you no longer belong to evil, but to good. It is your soul that I buy from you; I withdraw it from black thoughts and the spirit of perdition, and I give it to God." With this proclamation of redemption, newly released prisoner Jean Valjean embarks on the path of virtue, and a classic of world literature soars. Les Mis rables is the story of Jean Valjean's transformation from criminal to hero, and his dedication to doing good in a world where harsh laws often thwart the most benevolent impulses. Imprisoned for nineteen years after stealing a loaf of bread to feed his sister's starving family, Valjean is on track to become a repeat offender until a charitable bishop's act of pity compels him to transform into an honest man. Over the next two decades, Valjean becomes a successful businessman and a generous benefactor to is orphan ward, Cosette. But the implacable Inspector Javert, who knows of Valjean's criminal past and who enforces the law mercilessly, hounds him from town to town, seeking to apply a standard of justice that does not acknowledge either rehabilitation or renewal. A vivid historical romance whose events climax spectacularly during the Paris Uprising of 1832, Les Mis rables was praised by Upton Sinclair as "one of the half-dozen greatest novels of the world." This unabridged edition of Victor Hugo's classic work is as stirring a tale of adventure today as it was when first published in 1862.
