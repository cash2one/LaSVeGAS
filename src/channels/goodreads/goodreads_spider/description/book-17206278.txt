17206278:::::System Purge:::::Fourteen-year-old Tommy Philips doesn t know where he comes from. He has questions that his foster parents can t answer, questions about who he is and what makes him so different from everyone around him. When he stumbles across evidence that one of his teachers has been guarding him for years, Tommy begins an investigation that will uncover a history he never could have guessed. Rowan Darren wasn t just born to be a soldier, he was made to be one. The Nospious, a collection of twelve Houses of genetically-engineered humans, live in silent conflict, fighting quiet political wars against each other and the outside world, constantly trying to advance their interests to the detriment of anyone who gets in their way, while concealing their existence. Rowan, of the House of Aries, is no exception. After years overseas, expanding his House s influence, Rowan is coming home, but the home waiting for him is anything but simple, and survival will require more than a few modified genomes. Though he goes by Samuel, his name is Three, and ever since The War claimed the lives of his siblings, he has been the oldest living synthetic lifeform on Earth. Maintaining control over the increasingly restless Society of Machines has always been difficult, but a second war has been brewing for years, and if Samuel doesn t get in front of it in time, it will cost the Society both lives and the secrecy that they ve cultivated for years. Three lives moving in very different directions will all meet at a crossroads, and all three will be forever changed.
