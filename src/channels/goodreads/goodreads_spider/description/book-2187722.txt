2187722:::::March of the Hooligans:::::Hooligan-turned-acclaimed author Dougie Brimson is the UK's most respected authority on soccer hooligan-ism. Now, in a book written specifically for an American audience, he tells the astonishing story of the rampant hooliganism among European soccer fans and how it could spread to the United States. Written in the raw, in-your-face style that has won considerable acclaim in Europe--the "Daily Mail" (London) said Brimson had written "probably the best book ever on soccer violence"--"March of the Hooligans" is a powerfully intimate look at what hooliganism has become and where it is headed.
