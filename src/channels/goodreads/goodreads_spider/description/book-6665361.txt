6665361:::::Danger at the Door:::::Since her fiance's tragic death, Laney rarely leaves her home, and even then it's only for emergencies. Over time, she becomes a recluse. Loneliness begins to dominate her life, but it's the overwhelming fear that controls it. She manages to survive -- barely -- on food delivery services and her work-at-home job. When she tries to move on from her grief the commemorative meal she orders is ruined, but it leads to an unlikely friendship with an attractive man who speaks little English. Bojan feels awful about delivering the ruined meal. He befriends Laney out of compassion for her circumstances and the sense that she needs him. Unfortunately, he continually says the wrong things, upsetting her. But Bojan is determined to win her trust -- and perhaps her heart. As the two grow closer, Laney has this strange feeling of being watched and wonders if she's losing her mind. Complicating things further, the few times she leaves her house something goes wrong, confirming that she is safer at home. Can Bojan convince Laney she'll be safe with him, or will his presence put her in further danger?
