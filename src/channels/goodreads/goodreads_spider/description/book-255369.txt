255369:::::The Haunted Dolls' House and Other Ghost Stories:::::Stories by a visionary master of supernatural fiction In volume two of the only annotated edition of M. R. James's complete writings currently available, Penguin Classics brings together tales from James's final two works, A Thin Ghost and Others and A Warning to the Curious . In these stories, James continues his fearsome transformation of the ghost story from its nineteenth-century heritage, drawing upon his deep knowledge of medieval history and biblical curiosa. This edition features a number of little-known tales that have rarely been assembled, including The Fenstation Witch, presented here for the first time in a corrected text, a new translation of Twelve Medieval Ghost Stories, and a number of James s essays. Edited and with an introduction and notes by S. T. Joshi.
