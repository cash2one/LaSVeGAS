4641540:::::Viva Vermont!:::::Mix six teenaged girls and one 60s fashion icon (retired, of course) in an old Victorian-era boarding home. Add guys and dating, a little high-school angst, and throw in a Kate Spade bag or two and you ve got The Carter House Girls, Melody Carlson s new chick lit series for young adults! Christmas is coming and Mrs. Carter treats the girls to a weekend trip to General Harding s luxurious Vermont ski lodge. Naturally, she has no idea that Taylor has invited some guys to follow them boys who have a different type of adventure in mind. As usual, Mrs. Carter does not pay close attention to the girls activities. When a dinner outing and small accident keep her away overnight, DJ, Eliza, Taylor, Kriti, Rhiannon, and Casey are quickly in over their heads. As a party gets completely out of hand, only God s help can get the Carter House girls out of this gigantic mess."
