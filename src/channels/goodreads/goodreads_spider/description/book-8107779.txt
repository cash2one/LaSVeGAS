8107779:::::Secrets of the Demon:::::Homicide detective Kara Gillian has a special talent: she can sense the "arcane" in our world, and there's quite a bit of it, even in Beaulac, Louisiana. She's also a summoner of demons, and works on a task force that deals with supernatural crimes. Her partners are attractive and smart FBI agents, but they're not summoners, and they're not telling Kara why they are on this special force with her. To complicate things even more, Kara has pledged herself to one of the most powerful of demons Demon Lord Rhyzkahl who helped save her partner's life, but now expects things in return. Meanwhile, she's trying to solve a string of murders that are somehow tied together by money, sex, rock music and...mud. But how can she concentrate on the case when she's not even sure who or what her partners are? Secrets of the Demon is the exciting third installment of the Kara Gillian series.
