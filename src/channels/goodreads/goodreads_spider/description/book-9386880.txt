9386880:::::Wild Apples:::::Henry David Thoreau was an American author, poet, naturalist, tax resister, surveyor, historian, philosopher, and leading transcendentalist. He is best known for his book Walden. He was deeply interested in the idea of survival in the face of hostile elements, historical change, and natural decay. He was a strong abolitionist and his belief in a philosophy of civil disobedience influenced the political thoughts and actions of such later figures as Leo Tolstoy, Mahatma Gandhi, and Martin Luther King, Jr. First published in "The Atlantic Monthly" in 1862, Thoreau's essay begins with a history of the apple tree, and ends with a meditation on parallels between the wild apple and humanity.
