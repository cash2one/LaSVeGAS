359696:::::Escape with the Dream Maker:::::Something strange and terrible has been happening in Nuworld. Some of God's most trusted servants have disappeared- simply vanished! With only a list of the missing persons and a secret password, God has sent the Seven Sleepers on another mission: "Find My servants and bring them back, but be very careful. You might be one of the next to disappear." That could never happen, of course. Josh, Sarah, Dave, and the others know God too well to be tricked by one of His enemies... Or do they? What starts out as a harmless game--a stress reliever--could be the end of the Sleepers, and the end of all of God's servants. Come along as Josh Adams and his friends learn a few unexpected lessons about deception and addiction, and a lot about themselves. Join the Seven Sleepers on their most dangerous mission yet!
