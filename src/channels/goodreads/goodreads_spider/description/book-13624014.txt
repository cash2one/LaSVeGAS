When Boston psychic Lucy Valentine finds herself involved in a group of eccentric psychics trying to learn more about their abilities, she is convinced a rare spring heat wave has flushed the crazies out of hiding. Adding to her theory is her newest client in the Lost Loves division of Valentine, Inc., her family s lucrative matchmaking firm. He s an animal communicator who hires Lucy to find his purrfect mate because his cat told him so. But craziest of all is The Beantown Burner, a serial arsonist who is targeting private eye Sam Donahue, the brother of Lucy s boyfriend, Sean. With the help of her kooky psychic group, Lucy must tap into abilities she didn t know she had to catch the firebug before the fires turn deadly. What she never expected to discover is that the motive behind the flames hits a little too close to home...and her heart.
