18399828:::::A Medical Affair:::::After a terrifying life-threatening asthma attack induced by the fumes in her swanky new apartment, Heather Morrison falls for the handsome but very married doctor who saved her. Her "knight in shining armor" turns out to be less of a knight as time goes by and more of a heartbreak waiting to happen. As the saying goes, this is not what the doctor ordered. When the relationship ends, Heather's life dramatically changes as she finds herself addicted to prescription pills she never needed and her future as a mother in question. Set in the bustling city of New York, A Medical Affair by debut author Anne McCarthy Strauss could be a game changer for many women as it exposes the truth behind her doctor's behavior and her subsequent filing of a civil suit. Although a work of fiction, A Medical Affair was extensively researched. This is truly a story that must be told.
