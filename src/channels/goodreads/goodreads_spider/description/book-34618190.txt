34618190:::::Glimpse Spirit vol. 6:::::Part 6 of The Glimpse Series - collectible flash fiction anthologies In Glimpse SPIRIT, Mathisen redirects Christian fiction to an exciting place where a fresh blend of prayer, drama and prose emerges. Applying her well-known writing style to the everyday struggles and triumphs of Christian life, the author connects scenes from Biblical text directly to the reader s own walk with God. The result is a touching mix that both uplifts and admonishes the soul. It is my intention and hope that Christians will find encouragement and fellowship in SPIRIT. The most important thing to remember is you're not walking alone. Everyone has felt the same highs and lows in their Christian walk. Just hang on tight and keep going. - Lisa Mathisen, Author
