137996:::::The Cold One:::::The Los Angeles police are investigating two strings of gruesome deaths. One killer has left several horribly mangled corpses; the other murderer kills his victims seemingly without touching them. The investigators have only a single set of fingerprints to link the two series of crimes. Journalist Peter Jacobs is dragged into the investigation when he receives an anonymous call from someone who knows more than he should about the murders. They agree to meet at a specific place and time, but the caller never shows up -- and the killings continue. When Julie Moore, a graduate student researching Near Death Experiences, falls in love with Peter, she has no way of knowing that she has placed herself in the deadly sights of the Cold One. The Cold One needs Peter to complete its mysterious designs -- but it does not hate Julie for interfering. It feels nothing -- no hate, no fear, no love -- and Its mere existence threatens all living things. Until recently, Jerry Washington belonged to a violent street gang. Trying to go straight, Jerry meets Susan Darly, an upper-crust high school sweetheart, and finds that life can be warm and wonderful. Then Susan almost drowns -- and is terribly changed. She has become as cold as death, and Jerry is determined to find out why. In India, Govinda Sharma's spiritual master has given him a dangerous job -- to pursue a seemingly invincible man, a blind man who can dominate another's will with a mere thought. This man will lead Govinda to the Cold One, and to a great truth that will shatter him to the core. Govinda Sharma, Jerry Washington, and Peter Jacobs are the last defenders of mankind. The Cold One knows who they are. It knows they are coming. And it does not care.
