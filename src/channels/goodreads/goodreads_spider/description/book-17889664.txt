17889664:::::To Live and Die in Fantasyland:::::In this final installment of the bestselling fantastical TO LIVE trilogy, Shawn Michals morphs into a new guise, that of Rusty Loury, a former hero to millions who flees back to his home island from Los Angeles and tries to bury his past not only as his persona as Shawn Michals but as a name he has never known. Yet a mysterious woman, Bina, locates him and coaxes him into the present, and in doing so forces him to find revolution, evolution, and aspects of himself previously thought lost and buried. The unfolding events affect both Rusty Loury and also the island upon which he knows as home. He is called upon to lead, and must find within himself the will to launch a surge of action against not only the powers that are stifling freedoms of the island s inhabitants, but also his own personal abandon to choose. What fantasy will this wanderer accept in the end? Either path leads to a way to dance about this fantasy we all may live. Open this book. It s a risk worth taking. "Strong pacing... well timed." - Publishers Weekly "Rest assured, fantasyLAnds are very real. To quote STEPHEN KING, 'If you think I m kidding, you missed the nightly news.' - Rusty Loury
