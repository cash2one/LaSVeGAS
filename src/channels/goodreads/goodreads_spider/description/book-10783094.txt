10783094:::::Dating a Cougar:::::After several decades of looking for true love and never finding it, aging model and lingerie designer, Alexa Ranger, has finally given up the search. A couple years ago, she got tired of the game completely and just stopped dating. Now friends and family keep her mostly content, so it s shocking at 50 yrs old to find herself suddenly wanting a sex life again. It s even more shocking to be attracted to a much younger man this time. She definitely thinks medically retired Marine, Casey Carter is sexy, but can t get passed their twelve year age difference to even consider a fling. Not that it matters anyway, anything resembling a normal dating relationship is totally out of the question because Casey is related to and living with her daughter s boyfriend. The very last thing Alexa needs is yet another talk-show worthy drama in her already complicated life, no matter how amazing Casey s kisses make her feel. *** This is a great character study in romance and the first of the series. I can't wait to read them all. I definitely recommend this author and her books to anyone who loves a good romance and likes to laugh. And keep an eye out for more from this wonderful lady. ~ Jesse V. Coffey, National Examiner and On Air Host of Edin Road Radio
