26159625:::::Identity Crisis:::::A simple domestic abuse case turns deadly when the alleged abuser is killed and Stephanie Ann Sam McRae s client disappears. When a friend asks Sam to find Melanie Hayes, the Maryland attorney is drawn into a complex case of murder and identity theft that has her running from the Mob, breaking into a strip club and forming a shaky alliance with an offbeat private investigator to discover the truth about Melanie and her ex-boyfriend. With her career and life on the line, Sam s search takes her from the blue-collar Baltimore suburbs to the mansions of Gibson Island. Along the way, she learns that false identities can hide dark secrets, and those secrets can destroy lives. Of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock once said, There is no terror in the bang, only in the anticipation of it. Author Debbi Mack nails that statement in this tightly written tale about a flawed Maryland attorney, Sam McRae, and her relentless search for a killer Mack crafts a taut narrative with crackling dialogue.
