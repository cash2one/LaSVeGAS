35517449:::::The Koalemos Initiative:::::What is TKI? TKI is not like anything ever created before (that is the kind of line business managers make you write, I apologise), it is 3 books in 1 which is quite surprising given that it is a novella. Layer 1 Layer one is a thriller that has none stop action from start to finish. Who is the man in the yellow polo shirt? Is he an anarchist, a jihadist or a fascist bent on a new world order? What was he doing at the scene of two separate terrorist attacks and why has he reappeared five years later during the deadliest bombings London has seen since the blitz? Agent Heller, the only member of her Majesty's Secret Service that believes the man in the yellow polo shirt is behind it all, must find out the deadly truth, but what is the truth in the world of espionage and where does reality end and madness begin? Layer 2 Layer two is a philosophical meta-fiction discussing the ramifications of actions and thoughts. What if everything that happened in the world of a novel was real? What if authors were evil monsters torturing innocent characters with their evil schemes? And what does that make the reader? Layer 3 Layer three is a literary criticism discussing the state of modern commercial fiction, its inflexible state of being, the trite cliches, the sloppy editing, the scores of grammar and spelling mistakes and its obsession with sales over quality. If novel writing has basically become an algorithm to be followed, why would the world need writers anymore? If the world simply wants the same thing in slightly varying degrees, what is the point of creativity?
