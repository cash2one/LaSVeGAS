1628198:::::Bifocal:::::On the White Ravens' Outstanding New International Books for Children and Young Adults list, 2008 ForeWord Magazine 's Book of the Year Awards Bronze Medal Winner (YA Fiction category), 2007 Snow Willow Award nominee, 2008 CCBC's Best Books for Kids and Teens, 2008 Two bestselling authors join forces to write a powerful novel about racism. A student arrested on suspicions of terrorism. A high school torn apart by racism. Two boys from two different sets of circumstances forced to choose sides. These are the issues at the heart of Bifocal , a ground-breaking new novel for young-adults. The story is told from two different points of view. Haroon is a serious student devoted to his family. His grandparents emigrated from Afghanistan. Jay is a football star devoted to his team. He is white. One day their high school is put on lockdown, and the police arrest a Muslim student on suspicion of terrorist affiliations. He might be guilty. Or is he singled out because of his race? The entire student body fragments along racial lines and both Haroon and Jay find that their differences initially put them at odds. The Muslim students become targets and a smoke-bomb is set off near their lockers while Jay and his teammates believe they've been set-up to look like racists. Bifocal is, by no stretch, an easy book. Award-winning authors Deborah Ellis and Eric Walters deliver a serious, hard-hitting book about racism that does not talk down to young people.
