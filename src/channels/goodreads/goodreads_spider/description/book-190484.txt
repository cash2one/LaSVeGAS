190484:::::Andorra:::::Alexander Fox, former owner of an antiquarian bookstore in San Francisco, journeys to a fictional Andorra, a country both beautiful and perilous, following an unspecified accident which has left his wife and daughter dead. Sun-splashed but oddly deserted, Andorra affords a personal refuge to Fox until a series of strange events occur. A handsome, promiscuous Australian couple, one prominent Andorran family, teasing socialites, and dead bodies found floating in the harbor cast a shadow over Andorra's picture-postcard surface. An outsider, Fox falls under suspicion of murder and endures a number of puzzling interrogations. Menacing locals and territorial policemen force Fox to contemplate a desperate escape from Andorra. Strong hardcover performance. * Outstanding reviews. * Excellent track record of Cameron's prior novel, The Weekend , in Plume.
