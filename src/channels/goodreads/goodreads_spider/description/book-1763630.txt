Beset by the fabrications of gossips and press agents, stung by the thousands of words written by others, she began work on her autobiography. She gave the manuscript to her friend, confidant, and business partner, Milton Greene. Mr. Greene and the executors of Miss Monroe's estate have agreed that the time has now come for us all to hear what Marilyn herself had to say." Jacket front and endpaper photographs of Marilyn by Milton H. Greene. Little known and long unavailable, this autobiography, written by actress and starlet Marilyn Monroe (1926-1962), describes her early adolescence, her rise in the film industry from bit player to celebrity, and her marriage to Joe DiMaggio.
