12005966:::::Grosvenor Square:::::Untitled Document An engaging, romantic, provocative homage to the 19th-century novel. Amid the genteel charms of 19th-century London's elegant Mayfair district, the Hathaways take up residence in Grosvenor Square. With an increasing fortune, refined upbringing, and fashionable social circle, the close-knit family seems assured of a bright and comfortable future. But their idyllic world is disrupted by the arrival of Jasper Munroe, a distant relation who touches off a series of unsettling events that will change their lives forever. The Hathaway siblings - spirited Lorna, gentle Tom, and beautiful Rosamond - are led down divergent paths of self-discovery, both virtuous and destructive, as each learns about love, loss, and the price of preserving the ties that bind. In a story of beauty and philosophy, romance and heartache, betrayal and redemption, Grosvenor Square explores the intricacies of human relationships and raises significant questions about the extent to which lives are shaped not only by individual choice, but just as compellingly, by the influence of others. Stylistically reflective of the Victorian novelists to whom it pays tribute, Grosvenor Square reveals a poignant narrative embedded with a relevant social commentary. "Seamlessly blending 19th-century history with captivating storytelling, Katherine Ann Meyer has created an engaging story written with vivid detail and authenticity. Grosvenor Square will take you on a memorable journey. You won't want to put it down." (Jennifer Blanchard, founder of The Procrastinating Writers Blog)
