572917:::::My Crowd:::::Long before sick humor was in vogue, the deliciously ghoulish cartoons of Charles Addams had established his reputation as one of the deans of American comic art. The New Yorker published its first Addams cartoon in 1932, and his cast of genial ghouls, friendly freaks, and the famous family brought a touch of gleeful creepiness to its pages for more than five decades. This classic collection of more than 200 cartoons, from the master of the macabre at his most diabolical, contains the best cartoons from his first six books and is sure to delight both fans and cartoon connoisseurs.
