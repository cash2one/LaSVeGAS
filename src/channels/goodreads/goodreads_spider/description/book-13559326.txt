13559326:::::The Red Chamber:::::An epic reimagining of the Chinese classic Dream of the Red Chamber, set against the breathtaking backdrop of eighteenth-century Beijing, where the lives of three unforgettable women collide in the Inner Chambers of a ducal mansion. When the orphaned Daiyu leaves her home in the provinces to seek shelter with her cousins in Beijing, she is drawn into a world of opulent splendor presided over by the ruthless, scheming Xifeng and the prim, repressed Baochai. As she learns the secrets behind their glittering fa ades, she is tangled in a web of intrigue reaching all the way to the Emperor's Palace, and finds herself no longer able to distinguish friend from foe. From the petty gossip of the servants' quarters to the political turmoil that will overthrow the dynasty and plunge the once-mighty family into grinding poverty, The Red Chamber is a sweeping portrait of three women whose lives are transformed by the power of friendship and the force of history in a world where love and duty tear them apart.
