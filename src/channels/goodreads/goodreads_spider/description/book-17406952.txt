17406952:::::Chaos Panzer:::::Barely getting home from work? Tired of your annoying boss and over-competitive colleagues? Frustrated with your tax deductions? All of the above? Then read on! Join our unlikely hero, Ayel, as he makes his way through overpriced cab fares, paranormal bloggers, beggars with babies, camwhores, flying cars and giant robots. In 1986, an alien spaceship crashed on the Spratly Islands containing unlimited energy source and a vast supply of advanced technology. Fast forward to 2016 and China owns the islands now. With a behemoth Chinese company controlling the country s economy, Ayel tries to survive his daily life as a simple corporate employee. His life turns upside down when a ghost from his past returns to haunt him. With strange twists and conspiracies, Ayel may just find his boring life to be a little more interesting. "Angsty, nostalgic, and deeply semi-autobiographical, Chaos Panzer is the definite read for the striving Filipino in any IT career--tired of his work, furious of his rulers, resentful of his nation."
