407816:::::Little Drummer Girls:::::In the words of 7-year-old Jessica Wakefield... There are two Wakefield twins in our marching band, but only one drum. Which twin should play it? Me, of course. But my twin sister, Elizabeth, got picked instead! I want to play that drum more than anything. And I won't stop making noise until I do!
