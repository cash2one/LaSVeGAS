96789:::::Outrage: The Five Reasons Why O.J. Simpson Got Away with Murder:::::Here at last is the account of the O.J. Simpson case that no one else has dared to write, that no one else could write. In Outrage , the famed prosecutor of Charles Manson and bestselling author of Helter Skelter goes to the heart of the trial that divided the country and made a mockery of justice. Vincent Bugliosi, who never lost a murder case, brilliantly outlines the five reasons why O.J. Simpson got away with murder: the worst possible jury, a sloppy and incomplete prosecution, a fatal change of venue, judicial error that allowed the defense to play the race card, and a weak summation and rebuttal that barely addressed the defense's frame-up and conspiracy theories. He reveals: --The offer Marcia Clark and Bill Hodgman should never have refused. --The bluff that saved the defense's cardboard case. --What Deputy Sheriff Jeff Stuart overheard when Rosey Grier visited Simpson in jail. --The 17 words Johnnie Cochran used to cover his argument that could have been his undoing if caught. --Why the jurors never heard Simpson's first police interview-- filled with self-incriminating statements that alone could have convicted him of murder. 1. What mistake in jury selection could have cost Marcia Clark the trial--even before she argued the case? 2. What did Simpson do to make sure the gloves wouldn't fit? 3. How did Judge Ito's behavior towards Marcia Clark prejudice the jury? 4. Why did the prosecutors suppress Simpson's "smoking gun"? 5. How did Johnnie Cochran con the jury? 6. Who might really have suggested that Simpson try on the evidence gloves?
