580918:::::Jessica's Secret Friend:::::In the words of 7-year-old Jessica Wakefield... Lila Fowler is NOT my best friend. We had a BIG fight and now we're not friends anymore. I was really sad...until I found a bottle floating in the ocean. It had a message inside! The message was from a girl who really needs a friend. Just like me! Now I have a secret friend. But will I ever get to meet her?
