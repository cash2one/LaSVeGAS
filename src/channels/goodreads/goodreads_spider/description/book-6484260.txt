6484260:::::My Shit Life So Far:::::Frankie's outrageous, laugh-out loud, cynical rant on life as he knows it is presented here in all its outrageous glory. From growing up in Pollockshaws, Glasgow "it was an aching cement void, a slap in the face to childhood, and for the family it was a step up" to his rampant teenage sex drive "in those days if you glimpsed a nipple on T.V. it was like porn Christmas" and first job working in a mental hospital, nothing is out of bounds. Outspoken, cynical, and always outrageous, Frankie Boyle, the dark heart of Mock the Week , says the unsayable as only he can. From the TV programs he would like to see made ( Celebrities On Acid On Ice "just like Celebrities Dancing On Ice , but with an opening sequence where Graham Norton hoses the celebrities down with liquid LSD"), to his native Scotland and the Mayor of London, nothing and no one is safe from Frankie's fearless, sharp-tongued assault. Sharply observed and full of taboo-busting, we-really-shouldn't-be-laughing-at-this humor, My Shit Life So Far shows why Frankie Boyle really is the blackest man in show business.
