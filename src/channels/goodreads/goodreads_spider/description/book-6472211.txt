The fact she s deaf doesn t make her survival skills any weaker, and she s been craving the chance to escape into the Yukon wilderness. Only the sexy beast of a man she bumps into at the cabin starts cravings of another kind, setting her hormones raging as well as raising strange questions about wolves, and mates, and pack challenges. All wilderness guide Keil Lynus wanted was a nice quiet retreat before challenging for the Alpha position of his Alaskan pack. He wasn t planning on meeting his destined mate, or finding out she s not aware she has the genes of a wolf. Between dealing with his accident-prone younger brother, a deaf mate with an attitude and an impending duel to the death, his week and his bed is suddenly full. Far from the relaxing getaway any of them had in mind Warning: Gives a whole new meaning to the phrase talking with your hands . Includes dangerous use of sarcasm and hot nookie in a remote wilderness sauna. ----- This NORTHERN LIGHTS EDITION is a revised and extended version of the 2009 original.
