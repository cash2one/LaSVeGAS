357936:::::Eleven:::::Winnie knows that change isn't all it's cracked up to be, especially when it means her best friend, Amanda, might be dropping her for someone else. Throw in a grumpy teenage sister, a cat who gets trapped in the wall, and a crush who has pinkeye, and you've got one big mess--one that Winnie's not going to clean up!
