1710618:::::The Museum Called Canada: 25 Rooms of Wonder:::::Hold our history in your hands, with a spectacular virtual museum that is at once a sweeping exploration of Canadian history and culture, an indispensable reference guide and a remarkable treasury of information. Welcome to a museum so vast and full of wonder that it could only be called Canada. Each of The Museum Called Canada s 25 rooms houses carefully chosen exhibits that illuminate a significant historical theme. This majestic collection brings together high art and popular culture, science and nature, rare objects and whimsical ephemera. Here you will see the empty eye sockets of Tyrannosaurus Rex and be able to examine intricate and ethereal wood-carved angels built for Quebec s Rideau Chapel. Exhibits span the breadth of our nation, from the Yuquot Whaler s Shrine of Vancouver Island s Nootka to an anti-Confederation poster from the controversially soon-to-be-province Newfoundland. Your guide to the collection is historian and author Charlotte Gray. For each room in the museum, Gray has written a short essay that delves into the world of a particularly evocative artifact and its importance in the context of the room s theme and time period. The Museum Called Canada with its expansive vision, its surprising juxtapositions, its visual feasts and intellectual explorations is a beautiful and inspiring place that you will want to visit again and again.
