1906946:::::I Say a Prayer for Me: One Woman's Life of Faith and Triumph:::::Now in paperback, Stanice Anderson's engrossing book offers lessons of God's faithfulness as she recounts her journey through addiction, tragedy, and pain to eventually emerge whole. When Stanice Anderson first began experimenting with drugs, she never imagined she'd become an addict; she just wanted to get her feet wet. However, she quickly descended into full-fledged addiction, becoming what she describes as "a lonely, desperate, moral-less, and bitter woman hell bent on self-destruction." Caught in a vicious and deadly cycle of drugs and abusive relationships, she almost didn't survive. But God had another plan. One day, while shooting drugs and watching television she heard someone on the 700 Club saying that God loved her, and slowly she began to undertake the arduous journey to reclaim her life. Offering reflections on her past and the prayers that got her through her darkest hours, Anderson delivers a message of inspiration and hope as a living example of the healing and restorative power of God.
