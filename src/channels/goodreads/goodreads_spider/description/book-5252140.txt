5252140:::::Red Asphalt:::::See that car in your rear-view mirror? The driver wants to kill you. Don t take it personally. You just happen to be in the way. In Scott Cherney s new novel, Red Asphalt, the operator of the vehicle in question is a troubled medical courier in a triple threat cage match with his two biggest adversaries-everyday life and himself. His marriage to the woman he believed to be his soul mate is rapidly evaporating before his eyes. The book he s been working on for over a decade is slipping through his fingers as he struggles to complete it. As these pressures grow, he compensates by conjuring up outrageous road rage scenarios in the multiplex of his mind. As his life, job and dreams simultaneously implode, his wild fantasies begin to literally bleed over into reality. Now with a gun in one hand and a steering wheel in the other, this distant runner-up in the human race feels empowered for the very first time. At least our boy s finally found a purpose in life.
