15778506:::::My One Word: Change Your Life With Just One Word:::::The concept of My One Word is simple. Lose the long list of resolutions---all your sweeping promises to change---and do something about one thing this year instead of nothing about everything. Choose just one word that represents what you most hope God will do in you, and focus on it for an entire year. This single act will force clarity and concentrate your efforts. As you focus on your word over an extended period of time, you position yourself for God to form your character at a deep, sustainable level. Growth and change will result. Author Mike Ashcraft, who has led his megachurch through this My One Word project for more than five years, and Proverbs 31 Ministries author and speaker Rachel Olsen, who has lived it, are encouraging, insightful, good-humored, yet realistic in this enjoyable read. Their stories of growth and change through My One Word will keep you motivated. Throughout the book you'll also find words and stories of people just like you who have joined the My One Word movement and discovered the power of just one word. Includes discussion questions for use with the corresponding small group video curriculum, My One Word: A DVD Study.
