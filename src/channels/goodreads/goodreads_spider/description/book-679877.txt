679877:::::The Butterfly Garden:::::A contemporary, heartfelt love story from an extraordinary author with the romantic sensibility of Elizabeth Lowell and the emotional breadth of Nora Roberts. LOVE IS NOT ABOUT WHERE YOU'RE GOING...IT'S ALL IN HOW YOU GET THERE Carefree photographer Jenny Romano is nearly as famous as her subjects. Her globe-trotting life leaves little time for a serious relationship, and that's just the way she likes it. Besides, her perfect older sister Grace already occupies the role of dutiful wife and mother--or so it seems. Suddenly, Grace needs her sister more than ever, and Jenny finds herself in the sort of small town, suburban life she swore to avoid. But there is the attractive neighbor next door.... For psychologist Elliot Drake, healing pain is an around-the-clock job that keeps his own relationships short and bittersweet. But Elliot has never met anyone like Jenny. Brash, outrageous, unpredictable, she's a force of nature--nothing at all like her cool, collected older sister. She's also made it clear that she's not sticking around for long. And suddenly, Elliot's not so sure that short-term is the way he wants things... Taken by surprise and unsure of the next step, Elliot and Jenny are about to discover that real life happens whether you want it to or not--and truth gives wings to the heart's most important journeys.
