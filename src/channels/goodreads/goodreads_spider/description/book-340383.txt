340383:::::Ecology:::::As we survey the effects of modernism environmental destruction, the net consumption of irreplaceable natural resources, the ever-widening gulf between first and third worlds we are forced to grapple with the consequences of the domination of nature by human beings. The readings gathered here join these issues with critical theory to examine the ongoing struggle to rediscover the nature within human beings and to reconnect it with external nature. Starting with an examination of the use of modernist thought as legitimation for the domination of nature, the collection progresses on a broad front: It examines how first-world economies create third-world dependency; the connections between poverty and population; how basic needs could be fulfilled in a green sustainable economy; the debate among deep, social, and socialist ecologists over the new ecological worldview; ecofeminism and the liberation of both women and nature; environmental justice for minorities and third-world peoples; the need for new spiritual relations between people and nature; and a new postmodern science that offers people a partnership with nature. The conclusion presents the "Principles of Environmental Justice," adopted by the First National People of Color Environmental Leadership Summit. Each essay stands on its own as a contribution to the ecological debate, but the cumulative effect is clearly to ask how critical theorists, current environmental philosophers, and scientists propose to liberate both human beings and nature.
