444382:::::The Light Princess:::::The Light Princess --the princess who "lost her gravity"--has been essential fiction for several generations of children. This new edition is a companion volume (same page size, similar design) to our edition of The Golden Key , of which Publishers' Weekly said: "Maurice Sendak lights the way through MacDonald's Kingdom with the most mystical, the most poetic pictures of his distinguished career." Now Sendak has made the pictures The Light Princess always deserved to have. This is the only separate edition available that preserves the authentic text; it is neither cut nor edited nor "improved" in any way.
