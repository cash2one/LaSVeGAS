28088327:::::Provocative:::::Coming home to a quiet, dark house. Meals by myself, because she was already done. Excuses and apologies, they were never enough. But even with that, when I touched her when she arched under me and pulled me deeper we couldn t get back to where we needed to be. Where we used to be. It was all frustration. Loneliness. Loss. Because even though she was no longer my student, the chemistry was always there. Adele and I loved each other. We thought we were unshakeable. But love isn t always enough. It wasn t enough when I constantly disappointed her. It wasn t enough when loss cleaved us in two. And when she left me, love was not enough. She didn t know yet that I d never stop fighting for her. But she would. **Author s note- Let s be real clear that this is BOOK TWO of a duet, and you re going to want to read Tempting before you read this one. Adele and Nathan started their story in that book, and you ll get the same sex, fighting, and cursing that you did in the first. But if you want it to make sense, read Tempting first. If any of that offends you, please avoid them both.**
