616694:::::DragonKnight:::::Return to the land of dragons and magic you discovered in Dragonspell and DragonQuest, in this finely crafted and memorable work of fantasy fiction with a core of eternal truth. Trapped in an evil spell... can the knights of Paladin be rescued? Before vowing his allegiance to Wulder as a knight, Bardon heads to the mountains for solitude. His life is suddenly complicated by a woman and her granddaughter, N'Rae, who are on a mission to rescue the woman's son trapped in a chamber of sleep. When Bardon learns that more of Paladin's knights are imprisoned within the chamber, he suspects one of them is Dragon Keeper Kale's missing father. The band travels north, uncertain of their destination and encountering numerous perils. When they unlock the chamber, they discover a dozen knights. But the knights cannot be awakened, and the journal holding the secret to rousing them is in an unknown language. How can they find the help they need, and overcome even graver obstacles, to rescue the knights?
