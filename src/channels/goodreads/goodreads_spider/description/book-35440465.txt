35440465:::::Love on the Line:::::Romance on the job will ruin Andrea's credibility and she knows it, so why can't she ignore that cocky foreman the crew calls Rooster? Andy may not have pipeline know-how, per se, but she s got brains and a willingness to prove that she can do the job. Her estranged grandpa, Buck, believes she has what it takes to be his engineering assistant, and she s not about to let him down. Rooster isn t a bad guy. He respects women; he was raised by one of the best. But that new girl is too small and feminine. She s a distraction, plain and simple, and she doesn t belong on a pipeline. This job is his chance to impress Buck Brennan, a pipeline legend, and no girly greenhorn is going to ruin it for him. Will Andy prove herself to her grandfather and forge a relationship with the old man, or will continuous disagreements and unexpected sexual tension between Andy and Rooster derail their hard work?
