106197:::::Becket:::::The celebrated play that draws from historical events in the Norman conquest of England to create a profound portrait of a man's soul and a transcendent vision of the human spirit From its powerful opening scene, of a naked King Henry II praying at the tomb of Thomas Becket, to the final wrenching act of ultimate self-sacrifice, Jean Anouilh's Becket remains a towering achievement in the history of the theatre. Winner of the Antoinette Perry Award for Best Play of the Season, Anouilh's monumental work introduced in this edition by the acclaimed writer and critic Andre Aciman draws from historical events in the Norman conquest of England to paint a profound and enduring portrait of the saint and martyr.
