18003780:::::Bill of Human Wrongs:::::Eve is a housewife living in the year 2050, a time where the country is being run by white males and all other societies have been driven to walled cities. If Eve expresses her disdain, she will be exiled by her husband to a life she is not accustomed to, so she lives among the heinous actions of those around her. That is, until she sees a dreadful murder. A killing takes place in front of her home, the murder of a Latina woman walking to the bus late at night. She watches as her husband and neighboring men cover it up. After trying to live with what she witnessed, she gives in to her guilt, and goes to the police in Latino Town. This moment of truth changes the country as she and all others know it. Eve is seen as the traitor of the century. Hate and bigotry cause civil war to erupt. Eve has to go undercover. Her own country has become a dangerous war zone. Then Eve stumbles upon a strange cafe, a gateway into the past when congress voted for the bill that caused her present to be a living hell for most citizens of the country. Can the future, her present, be changed now that she knows how to get to a time, the week before this bill is voted on?
