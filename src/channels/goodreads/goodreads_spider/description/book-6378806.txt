The book is based on the author's experiences in trying to operate a small chicken farm with her 1st husband Robert Heskett from 1927-31 near Chimacum, WA. On visits to family in Seattle, she told of their tribulations, which greatly amused them. In the 1940s, MacDonald's sisters encouraged her to write a book about these experiences. Following their advice, she wrote The Egg &amp; I as her 1st book. The Egg &amp; I received laudatory reviews &amp; soon appeared on the best-seller list.
