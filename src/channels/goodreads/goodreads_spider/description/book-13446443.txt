13446443:::::Between the Devil and the Deep Blue Sea:::::It s not like the movies, where they don t know they re dead. They don t often haunt people or places for revenge, and as far as I know they don t befriend lonely children. Usually. If you could see them, you might not even know them from some of the living. Empty-eyed and looking around at the world like they can t believe it s all still there and going on without them. Or maybe they re seeing it for the first time. This city is full of ghosts. I can see them all. Lucky me. Niki Slobodian sees things things that aren't supposed to be there. Labeled an Abnormal by New Government, her name is tacked onto the Registry, which seems to be getting longer these days. Now she can't work or she'll end up the same place as her father: in prison. But with no money coming in, Niki's getting desperate. So when a mysterious client offers to get her off the Registry in exchange for taking his case, Niki jumps at the chance. All she has to do is round up a homicidal Dark that's escaped from Hell and is cruising around the city in borrowed bodies. The murders are piling up, with Niki's notorious father somehow involved, and Niki's running out of time. And it seems the Dark isn't the only thing that escaped...
