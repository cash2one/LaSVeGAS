Embrace The Dark Side. . . Cousins Heming MacNachton and Tearlach MacAdie are bound by the same blood, the same ancient curse, and now the same quest: to search out the enemies of their clan--hunters who consider them soul-less demons and intend to exterminate them. But no sooner have Heming and Tearlach begun than they are drugged, separated, and taken captive. One is brought deep into the borderlands of Scotland, the other, in the dreary depths of Northern England. Caged and weakened, only two brave women give them hope. . . Brona Kerr and Lady Lucy Blytheswood are irresistibly drawn to the mysterious prisoners. Together, the women resolve to save them. In doing so, they will safeguard the clan's future and their own. For they are promised to cruel men who will do anything to possess them and the status that comes with them. Now Brona and Lucy must cross perilous terrain to fight for their lives--and for the men with whom they discover an eternal passion they never imagined. . .
