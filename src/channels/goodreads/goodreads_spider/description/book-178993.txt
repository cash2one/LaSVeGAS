178993:::::Yann Andrea Steiner:::::Duras manages to combine the seemingly irreconcilable perspectives of confession and objectivity, of lyrical poetry and nouveau roman. The sentences lodge themselves slowly in the reader s mind until they detonate with all the force of fused feeling and thought the force of a metaphysical contemplation of the paradoxes of the human heart. The New York Times Book Review (for The Lover ) Yann Andr a Steiner is a haunting dance between two parallel loves; the love between Marguerite Duras and the young Yann Andr a, and a love witnessed (or imagined) through the narrator s window a seaside romance between a camp counselor and a camper. The summer of 1980 flows into 1944 in this enigmatic journey through history, creation, and raw emotion. The daughter of French schoolteachers, Marguerite Duras (1914-1996) was born in Vietnam. At 17 she moved to France where she studied law and politics. She is the author of a great many novels, plays, films, and short narratives, including her internationally best-selling, ostensibly autobiographical work, The Lover (1984).
