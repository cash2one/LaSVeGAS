902743:::::Fair Play:::::Winner of the 2009 Bernard Shaw Prize for Translation Fair Play is the type of love story that is rarely told, a revelatory depiction of contentment, hard-won and exhilarating. Mari is a writer and Jonna is an artist, and they live at opposite ends of a big apartment building, their studios connected by a long attic passageway. They have argued, worked, and laughed together for decades. Yet they ve never really stopped taking each other by surprise. Fair Play shows us Mari and Jona s intertwined lives as they watch Fassbinder films and Westerns, critique each other s work, spend time on a solitary island (recognizable to readers of Jansson s The Summer Book ), travel through the American Southwest, and turn life into nothing less than art.
