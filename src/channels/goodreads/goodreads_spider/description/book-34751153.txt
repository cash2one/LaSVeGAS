A search party of three young Dwarfgiants is dispatched into the Dark Wood. With each member vying for a prestigious position in the Circle, they must, in so little time, bring Addi back. In doing so, they need to display courage and resourcefulness when confronted with strange beings and savage creatures. If successful, they would also find that Addi was not alone.
