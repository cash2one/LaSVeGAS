17493:::::Five Get into a Fix:::::The Famous Five are ski-ing - having lots of fun in the snow! But it's not long before they have a new mystery to solve. Like, who is living in the mysterious house near the chalet they're staying in? The caretaker says nobody has lived there for years, but the Five are sure they've seen a face at one of the windows...A terrified, haunted face, too. Have the gang got the courage to go close enough to the house to find out..?
