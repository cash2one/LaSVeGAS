620688:::::The New Left: The Anti-Industrial Revolution:::::This book is Ayn Rand's call to American youth to reject the tribal, conventional irrationality of the New Left and to grasp the need of a philosophical revolution founded on the supremacy of reason, with individualism, self-interest, science, technology, and progress as its consequences. There is nothing new about the New Left; it is the last gasp of an outworn philosophy. This is the view presented by Ayn Rand in a critical analysis of such superior perceptiveness and originality that it ranks as a landmark in the history of contemporary ideas. The New Left: The Anti-Industrial Revolution is a brilliant addition to the works of one of America's most influential thinkers.
