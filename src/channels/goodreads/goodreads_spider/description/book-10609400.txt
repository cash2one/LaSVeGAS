10609400:::::Within the Flames:::::From bestselling author Marjorie M. Liu, here comes an exciting new installment to her award winning "Dirk and Steele" series in which high stakes and sizzling passion keep readers riveted. Joining the Dirk and Steele Agency turned Eddie's life around. A pyrokinetic and former car thief, he cannot refuse an assignment to cross the continent in order to rescue an extraordinary woman in peril...even though he fears losing control of the destructive power of flame at his fingertips. The last of her shape-shifting kind, Lyssa hides in the abandoned tunnels beneath Manhattan, seeking refuge from those who murdered her family a decade ago and would now destroy her as well. Like Eddie, fire is her weapon, her destiny... and her curse. Yet she wants nothing to do with this mesmerizing stranger who seeks her trust while inflaming her passion. For beneath Lyssa's extraordinary beauty are dangerous secrets... and even darker, nearly irresistible urges. But she has won the heart of a fearless protector... and all the demons in the world will not make him back down.
