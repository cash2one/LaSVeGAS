After years of nonstop excitement -- of traveling around the globe in a chaotic rags-to-riches-to-rags whirl with her late husband, Charley -- Jackie had returned to Eternity, Colorado, near her hometown of Chandler. She wanted to put down roots, start a business, maybe someday fall in love again. But she never dreamed that the man who might make all her wishes come true was William Montgomery...little Billy, the lovesick boy who dogged her every step when she was a teenager...little Billy, who was now definitely a man, handsome, sexy, rich, and still madly in love with Jackie O'Neill.... In THE INVITATION, MATCHMAKERS, and A PERFECT ARRANGEMENT, Jude Deveraux brings us three novellas destined to delight us with her special brand of whimsy, while touching our hearts with the delicious romance that only comes from the imagination of America's most beloved storyteller.
