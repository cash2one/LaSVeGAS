2507629:::::Fireshadow:::::In the rain-soaked forests of South Western Australia, the lives of two young men collide across the years, leaving both of them changed forever. Eric is a WWII soldier, a German boy, imprisoned in a strange land. Vinnie is a modern teenager, scarred both physically and emotionally by the death of his sister. When these two lives meet, both will be changed, because sometimes wars are fought as much in the soul, as on the battlefield.
