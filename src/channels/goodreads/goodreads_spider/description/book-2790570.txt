2790570:::::Darling It's Death:::::Shell Scott. He's a guy with a pistol in his pocket and murder on his mind. The crime world's public enemy number one, this Casanova is a sucker for a damsel in distress. When a pair of lovely legs saunters into his office, he can't help but take the job, even when the case is a killer. Man oh man is she a looker. That's Shell's job, to just look at her -- day and, of course, night. But it gets kind of hard to check out those legs that just don't stop with a 350-pound thug in the way. Yeah, yeah, yeah the big boss wants Shell out of town, preferably in a bodybag, but Shell's got a job to do and nothing is going to come between him and that vision of absolute beauty.
