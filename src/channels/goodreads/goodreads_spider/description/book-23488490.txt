23488490:::::In Too Deep:::::At first glance, Cade and Aiden hardly seem like a match made in heaven. Their worlds couldn t be further apart. Cade is quiet, serious, and determined to succeed; Aiden's a party-loving frat boy. Cade comes from a rough home and worked hard to get the scholarships that make it possible for him to attend college; Aiden's had it all thrown in his lap by supportive, kind, and wealthy parents. Cade wants nothing to do with Aiden, but from the moment they meet, Aiden is determined to find a way to bring their different worlds together. Aiden manages to persuade Cade he s a decent guy, and a tentative friendship becomes much more.

Cade did what he had to do to escape his dead-end life, but now he sees he didn t leave it as far behind him as he thought.
