18586621:::::Until the End of the World:::::Cassie Forrest isn't surprised to learn that the day she s decided to get her life together is also the day the world ends. After all, she s been on a self-imposed losing streak since her survivalist parents died: she s stopped painting, broken off her engagement to Adrian and dated a real jerk. Rectifying her mistakes has to wait, however, because Cassie and her friends have just enough time to escape Brooklyn for her parents cabin before Bornavirus LX turns them into zombies, too. This is difficult enough, but Cassie s tag along ex-boyfriend and her friend s bratty sister have a knack for making everything, even the apocalypse, more unpleasant. When the two attract a threat as deadly as the undead to their safe haven, Cassie s forced to see how far she ll go to protect those she loves. And it s a lot farther than she d anticipated. This, coupled with Adrian s distant voice on Safe Zone Radio and, of course, the living dead, threaten to put Cassie right back into the funk she just dragged herself out of. Survival s great and all, especially when you have leather armor, good friends and home-brewed beer, but there s something Cassie must do besides survive: tell Adrian she still loves him. And to do that, Cassie has to find faith that she s stronger than she thinks, she s still a crack shot and true love never dies.
