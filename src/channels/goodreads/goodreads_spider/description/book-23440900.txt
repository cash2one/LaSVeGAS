23440900:::::Broken:::::Ciera Treat thought she was going to the doctor's office to get good news. Maybe she and her husband could finally have a baby. What she gets instead is her husband telling her he doesn't want a baby with her, a wife who's overweight and doesn't look feminine enough for him. He's already found somebody new. Broken and alone, Ciera can't imagine anyone who has been hurt more than her and is able to hold their head up. That is, until the day she meets sweet little Melly and her single daddy. Ciera finds it hard to believe in second chances, especially when everything her ex-husband found wrong with her is still true. This time around, things might be different, because Melly is broken too, but will her daddy want to stay with Ciera once he learns the truth?
