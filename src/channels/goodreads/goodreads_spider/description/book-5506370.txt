5506370:::::Unmasked:::::Next time you are rescued from a burning building by a tall, hung, muscle-bound man in tights, will you offer your services in appreciation? Why not? Superheroes have needs just like everyone else. All you have to do is promise to protect his secret identity and try not to damage the spandex! Some things just won't wash out. With any luck, you might become a sidekick. Every superhero has a super ability, and this latest Eric Summers collection of erotic short stories highlights those incredible talents that seem to come out when the sun goes down and the bedroom door closes. But, every superhero also has a weakness. Be careful because one such superhero in Unmasked: Erotic Tales of Gay Superheroes loses his powers if he has an orgasm. What is a boy to do? Unmasked: Erotic Tales of Gay Superheroes tells the stories of those hot men who are powerful in a dangerous situation and equally powerful under the covers. Try not to fall in love because the life of a superhero can be a lonely one, and the life of a heart-sick admirer can be even lonelier. Just lie back and enjoy the moment as a man with a cape and a mask takes you to new levels of ecstasy. Featured authors: DesertMac, Jay Starre, Troy Storm, Christopher Pierce, Stephen Osborne, Kiernan Kelly, Mark Wildyr, Ryan Field, Armand, Sedonia Guillone, and Jeremiah Bodkin. Plus a special bonus: Unmasked includes a comic strip by erotic artist Henry Kujawa.
