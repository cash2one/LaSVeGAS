6282146:::::Drops Like Stars:::::We plot. We plan. We assume things are going to go a certain way. And when they don't, we find ourselves in a new place---a place we haven't been before, a place we never would have imagined on our own.It is the difficult and the unexpected, and maybe even the tragic, that opens us up and frees us to see things in new ways.Many of the most significant moments in our lives come not because it all went right but because it all fell apart.Suffering does that. It hurts, but it also creates.This book is an exploration of the complex relationship between suffering and creativity, driven by the belief that there is art in the agony.
