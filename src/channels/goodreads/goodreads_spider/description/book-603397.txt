At last, Owen Palmer, the dreamboat wizard at Magic, Spells, and Illusions, Inc., has conjured up the courage to get Katie Chandler under the mistletoe at the office holiday party. But just when it looks like Katie has found her prince, in pops her inept fairy godmother, Ethelinda, to throw a wand into the works. Ethelinda s timing couldn t be worse. A plot hatched by MSI s rogue ex-employees, Idris and his evil fairy gal pal Ari, threatens to expose the company s secrets and the very existence of magic itself. Even worse, it could also mean the end of Katie s happily-ever-after. Now Katie and Owen must work side by side (but alas, not cheek to cheek) to thwart the villains plans. Braving black-magic-wielding sorceresses, subway-dwelling dragons, lovelorn frog princes, and even the dreaded trip to meet Owen s parents at Christmas, Katie and her beau are in a battle to beat Idris at his own sinister game. All mischief and matters of the heart will come to a head at a big New Year s Eve gala, when the crystal ball will drop, champagne will pour, and Katie will find herself truly spellbound.
