23270156:::::More Than Anything:::::Arriving home after work one evening, J rgen sees a young man who looks adrift and out of place and who promptly has a seizure on the sidewalk. J rgen takes care of him until the seizure passes and then, not knowing who to contact, takes care of him for the night. After giving the kid, Geir, a ride home the next morning, he expects that to be the end of it. He doesn't expect Geir to be a student at the vocational school where J rgen works as an electrician. He definitely does not expect to be drawn to Geir time and again, to want things that will never be possible for two people with more obstacles between them than can ever be overcome.
