Michael, governor of the province of Luz, also wants to lead the new planet and travels to Heaven to get permission. Abba consents. Feeling blindsided, Daystar turns against everyone he loves except beautiful Atara, whose fierce loyalty emboldens him to form a rogue army of rebel angels. Not even Abba, the Creator, conceives that Daystar could become so enchanted and deceived. Daystar appoints Atara to be his queen and together they seek to overtake Earth. As Luz burns from a surprise rebel attack, Michael and the other governors scour the earth to help angels who stand against the rebels. In Heaven, Abba issues an order that seals Daystar and Atara's fate. All around the globe, the rebels wreak havoc upon all that the angels had built. Michael's heart is broken. He knows his former friend is now eternally his enemy. Once a planet of promise, Earth convulses in its orbit as it turns into a burning wasteland. But Earth still has a future. Abba has a plan. This is Earth before Adam. This is the story of how evil became. "a wondrous world...I've not read anything like it before." (Heather S.)
