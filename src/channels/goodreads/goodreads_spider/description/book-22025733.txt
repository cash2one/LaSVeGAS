22025733:::::Obsession:::::Choose your hero wisely. Have you ever wanted the power to decide who the heroine of a story will ultimately end up with? Now is your chance with Drawn 2, where you have the choice of TWO sequels in which the characters follow TWO different paths to lead them to your chosen 'happily ever after'. This is not two stories told from different points of view. This is not an alternate ending - it's an entirely separate path that readers who choose to read both sequels will appreciate the 'sliding door' moments that set our characters off in different directions. Different choices. Different fates. You hold the power You get to choose - Aaron... or Damien. In Drawn, we met Etta and watched as her obsessive relationship with Damien sent both of them into world of darkness and self-destruction. We also met Aaron, the constant in Etta's life - the man who was willing to do anything it took to keep her safe. Two Men. One woman. A decision that will change everything... That decision is yours... Three years have passed since Aaron rescued Etta from Damien. In that time, things have changed, and they have made a life together. When Damien returns, demanding what he feels is rightfully his, Aaron will have to stand his ground or risk losing everything he holds dear. Their love, trust and commitment will all be put to the test in this tale of fighting for those you hold dear - even if the consequences could be catastrophic. In Drawn - Obsession, we follow Etta, Aaron and Damien. They will walk the path you set them on when you make the choice to support AARON. To support Damien, you will need to read Drawn - Redemption.
