407760:::::Lust, Caution: The Story:::::Now a major motion picture from Oscar-winning director Ang Lee ( Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Brokeback Mountain ): an intensely passionate story of love and espionage, set in Shanghai during World War II. In the midst of the Japanese occupation of China and Hong Kong, two lives become intertwined: Wong Chia Chi, a young student active in the resistance, and Mr. Yee, a powerful political figure who works for the Japanese occupational government. As these two move deftly between Shanghai s tea parties and secret interrogations, they become embroiled in the complicated politics of wartime and in a mutual attraction that may be more than what they expected. Written in lush, lavish prose, and with the tension of a political thriller, Lust, Caution brings 1940s Shanghai artfully to life even as it limns the erotic pulse of a doomed love affair.
