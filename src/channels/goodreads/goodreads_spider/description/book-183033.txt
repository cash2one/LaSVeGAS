183033:::::A Brief History of Neoliberalism:::::Neoliberalism--the doctrine that market exchange is an ethic in itself, capable of acting as a guide for all human action--has become dominant in both thought and practice throughout much of the world since 1970 or so. Writing for a wide audience, David Harvey, author of The New Imperialism and The Condition of Postmodernity , here tells the political-economic story of where neoliberalization came from and how it proliferated on the world stage.
