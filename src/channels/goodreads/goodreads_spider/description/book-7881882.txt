7881882:::::Flin's Destiny: Cobble Cavern:::::What starts out to be a fun field trip to Ireland for Flin and his school's debate team from New York, turns into a life changing adventure when the bus they are on ends up in an earthquake. Flin and his teammates get swallowed deep into the Earth and become trapped under the ocean inside a clear dome. Fighting to make their way back to the surface, they encounter a whole new world with evil creatures such as Snazzards, Snapdragons, and an eight foot tall pigman named Blade, who thinks that he rules the underworld with his Grimgoblins. After Flin gets pricked by one of his great grandfather's experimental pits, he discovers new powers within himself-both good and bad-and must learn how to master his new powers through true emotion. As Flin goes through the challenges that lie before him, he comes to realize that he was destined to travel in his great-grandfather's footsteps and rediscover what he had found under the ocean hundreds of years earlier.
