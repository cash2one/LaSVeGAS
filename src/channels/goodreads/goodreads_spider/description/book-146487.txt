146487:::::The Great American Novel:::::In this ribald, richly imagined, and wickedly satiric novel, Roth turns baseball's status as national pastime and myth into an occasion for unfettered picaresque farce, replete with heroism and perfidy, ebullient wordplay and a cast of characters that includes the House Un-American Activities Committee. "Roth invents baseball anew, as pure slapstick.... An awesome performance."-- "New Republic"
