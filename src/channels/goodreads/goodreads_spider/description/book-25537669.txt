25537669:::::Fear Us:::::KEENAN It s been four years since I ran away from home, my brother, and my maybe father. I created a life free of expectations while pretending I wasn t being hunted by all of the above. I managed to stay under the radar all this time or so I thought. When big brother shows up and saves my ass, I m forced to face everything I left behind, including her . SHELDON It s been four years since I became another statistic. I made a lot of mistakes when it came to Keenan Masters. The first was loving him at all. He took something from me the night he left, and when I told him I still loved him, he told me he d always hate me. After that, I learned how to be okay until he came back. Gone was the boy who always knew how to make me laugh, and in his place was a cold, arrogant monster .
