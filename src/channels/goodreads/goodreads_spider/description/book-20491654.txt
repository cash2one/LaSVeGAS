20491654:::::In Riley's Slumber:::::Liam Baldwin has a problem he has several, really. Gambling is only one of his vices; his obsession, Riley, is another. He'd never allowed the two to mix, and he'd never allowed either to interfere with the other, until now. In the last five years that Riley's been asleep, Liam has had to make sacrifices and 'adjustments' to ensure their survival. Now with Riley fully awake and inflicted with a condition of which there is no cure, Liam is once again faced with having to sacrifice all that he's striven for in hopes their relationship might have a chance. Riley, himself, has a tough decision to make also. He longs for peace and normalcy but those aren't two things Liam's known for. Is it ever acceptable to abandon the one you love in their time of need? Or should you always hang on till the bitter end?
