19179:::::Beowulf:::::Song of the Battle and Kings Beowulf is the earliest extant poem in a modern European language. It was composed in England four centuries before the Norman Conquest. As a social document this great epic poem is invaluable- reflecting a feudal, newly Christian world of heroes and monsters, blood and victory, life and death. As a work of art it is quite unique; Beowulf rings with a beaut, power, and artistry that have kept it alive for more than twelve centuries. The noble simplicity of Beowulf 's anonymous Anglo-Saxon singer is recaptured in this vivid translation by Burton Raffel.
