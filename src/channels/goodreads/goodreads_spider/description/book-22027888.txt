22027888:::::Surviving Us:::::Two survivors. Two weeks. One awakening. When Bristol Criswell travels to St. Lucia for an Enduring Life retreat, she hopes to discover encouragement and support from like souls. A vacation fling is the furthest thing from her mind, especially not with a cocky-mouthed, arrogant jerk like Davis McKay. But when it becomes evident she can't deny the magnetic attraction between the two, she gives in to her desires, and for the first time in her life, learns the difference between simply living and truly feeling alive. As their time in paradise quickly comes to an end, will her heart be able to withstand another devastating loss when it's time to say goodbye, or will their connection be strong enough to survive the real world? Death brought them together, but love will give them a reason to live. **This book is a full-length, stand alone novel that is not a part of a series**
