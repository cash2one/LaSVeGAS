32316602:::::Magnolias in Paradise:::::"Leonard Seet brings his intelligence and wit and gifts as a writer to a broader audience in "Magnolias in Paradise" in a gritty, realistic novel... reminiscent of the narrative technique of As I Lay Dying and Charming Billy... you'll definitely be engaged by this novel." -David Lentz, Author of Bloomsday: The Bostoniad "This book is immensely readable and is packed with fast paced actions and cliff hanging chapter endings." -Ashok Shenolikar, Author of What Did You Say Your Name Was? Ernst arrives at the Paradise train station with fifty-thousand dollars to ransom his sweetheart, and while looking among the crowd for the young man with a magnolia, a beggar seizes his bag of cash and escapes through the revolving door. Chasing after the rascal, he slams into his contact--his girlfriend's lover in town. Now, he must beat his love-rival to the money and rescue her before the deadline. MAGNOLIAS IN PARADISE is a 108,000-word crime novel and the first in a potential series. As in Larry Brown s Father and Son, good confronts evil in a southern town. And as in Joe R. Lansdale s Cold in July, an ordinary man gets sucked into a conspiracy, with psychopaths terrorizing a small town and FBI agents going after a corrupt sheriff. In the end, the man must take the law into his hands. But in this case, ending in tragedy. Here, the author combined Will Christopher Baer s surreal settings and mentally unstable villains, with Brian Evenson s literary minimalism and heroes cursing their knowledge.
