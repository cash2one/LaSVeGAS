22313627:::::Words of Radiance:::::The Knights Radiant must stand again. The ancient oaths have at last been spoken; the spren return. Men seek what was lost; I fear the quest will destroy them. It is the nature of the magic. A broken soul has cracks into which something else can be fit. Surgebindings, the power of creation themselves; they can brace a broken soul, but they can also widen its fissures. The Windrunner is lost in a shattered land, balanced upon the boundary between vengeance and honor. The Lightweaver , slowly being consumed by her past, searches for the lie she must become. The Bondsmith , born in blood and death, now strives to rebuild what was destroyed. The Explorer , straddling the fates of two peoples, is forced to choose between slow death and a terrible betrayal of all she believes. It is past time for them to awaken, for the Everstorm looms. And the Assassin has arrived.
