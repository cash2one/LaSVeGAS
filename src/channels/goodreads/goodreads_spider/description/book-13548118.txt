13548118:::::Classics on Infinite Earths: The Justice League and DC Crossover Canon:::::In this series, acclaimed comics scholar Dr. Julian Darius argues that the DC Universe is old enough to have produced a canon of classic stories. Here, he analyzes this canon as it pertains to the Justice League and DC s universe-wide crossovers. Since 1940, DC Comics has been bringing its heroes together, first as the Justice Society, then (beginning in 1960) as the Justice League, and finally (beginning in 1985) in universe-wide crossovers. Shared super-hero universes achieved widespread attention in the wake of Marvel s movies, but DC s been paving the way since 1940. A decade in the making, CLASSICS ON INFINITE EARTHS takes readers on a tour of this history, using discussion of classic stories as a unique way of illuminating the history and evolution of the DC Universe. In the process, Dr. Julian Darius offers what may be the very first long-term study of how to manage such a shared universe. From Sequart Organization. More info at http://sequart.org
