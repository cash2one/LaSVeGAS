17283481:::::Reverb:::::James Whren is brilliant, beautiful, rich, and taken with his genius for creating music. He's desired by many, yet commits to no one but his muse. Just twenty-eight, and at the pinnacle of his career, on the eve of his brother's funeral his father shatters his life, and James is left abandoned in hell with no one real to save him. His odyssey to freedom takes him beyond the looking glass, to the reflection of friends and lovers. Humbled and alone, James escapes to the Greek island of Corfu. But instead of finding solace there, loneliness almost consumes him. Until Elisabeth, and her son, Cameron. Reverb is romantic suspense and literary fiction "together flawlessly under the same cover," but at its core--a love story. Spun from from The Magus (John Fowles), also about a man who learns to love someone other than himself, and way beyond 50 Shades of Gray (E.L. James), Reverb is told like Crime and Punishment (Dostoyevsky), modern, tight, edgy verging on sharp. It's like nothing you've read, guaranteed.
