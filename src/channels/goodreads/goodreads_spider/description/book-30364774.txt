30364774:::::Interborough:::::The Raymond Rodriguez from a few years ago wouldn t recognize the guy he is today. He s left his slacker ways far behind him and is now juggling two jobs and school. But the balancing act doesn t allow much time for the man he loves. David is doing his best to be supportive, but problems at work and his own insecurity leave him frustrated in more ways than the obvious whenever he goes to bed before Raymond gets home. The heat and affection between them is still there, but they barely have the time or energy to enjoy it. And it doesn t help that Raymond is still hiding David from his colleagues. The stress mounts so high that a vacation in paradise is filled with turmoil instead of harmony, and culminates on their return to the five boroughs with broken promises and heartache. They have to figure out how to stop allowing their differences to overshadow their love. It s the only way they ll make it to forever.
