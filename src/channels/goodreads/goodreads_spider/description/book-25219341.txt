25219341:::::Shannon's Land:::::Popular mystery-thriller author D.B. Woodling, creator of the Detective Malone Series (Write Off and Final Claim) crosses genres with her newly published title, Shannon s Land. Capturing the struggles and determination that define heroine Shannon Cook, the Western novel weaves a compelling tale rich with fascinating characters, colorful Missouri landscapes, and Civil War history sure to appeal to a broad audience. The work includes several plot twists, yet she manages to stay true to the traditional romantic cadence of an Old West novel. Although the characters are all refreshingly diverse, the villain crawls off the pages with a biblical evil, a force so wicked his gun belt seems merely an accessory. From the kind and repentant Emily who presents herself at the opportune time to aide the desperate and exhausted Shannon to the passionate and haunted Luke who allows Shannon to reveal her emotional complexity, the individuals of Shannon s Land create a patchwork of personal motives, experiences, and qualities that add vivid color and texture to this compelling novel. *The publisher is offering the title in electronic version for $1.99 (for a limited time)!
