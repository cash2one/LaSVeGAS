13629892:::::Sanctuary:::::The Ben Coverdale Trilogy Part One 'Sanctuary'. A Story of Mystery and Romance. When Ben receives a garbled email message, he knows that the idyllic lifestyle he had hoped for by moving to France is about to end. Ben Coverdale has lived happily with Mary Willson for the past five years but on the fifth anniversary of their moving in together, Mary announces that she is leaving him to live with Donald, a man many years her senior. Distraught, Ben now takes the opportunity to fulfil a dream that he has had for many years and move to France and start a new life there. Mary becomes increasingly puzzled by Donald's behaviour; doing his best to keep her away from her friends, insisting that she change her hairstyle and buying strange, outagaeous clothes for her. Things are made much worse when she discovers that she is carrying Ben's child. As things rapidly deteriorate, Mary and her baby are taken, with the help of an old friend, to meet up with Ben, only to find that her old adversary, Katie Forrester, is there before her. At first glance, 'Sanctuary' may appear to be a romantic novel, but it isn't. Nothing is quite as it seems. 'Sanctuary is a well written, first novel for our author. I loved the development of the characters, they are charming. The quirky, best friend Georgina "Grunge" and the implementation of Madam Delphine was genius. The story line is concise and there are twists and turns that keep your attention. I found myself laughing or saying 'Oh no' out loud. This is a great weekend/rainy day/beach read and I cannot wait to read the sequel "Repercussions".' - Amazon.com Review.
