Just as his club is settling down and putting the betrayal by their former president behind them Bonnie Hamilton stumbles into the club and into his life. She declared the war wasn't over with the Raging Riders and it becomes a personal war of his own. When he first saw Bonnie he wanted to have her but all that dissolved when he discovered she was the enemy's daughter. Now he has been given the task of watching over her. With the two of them being so close, can he figure out if she is a threat to him and his brothers before he gets in too deep. Or will his desire for her blindside him to their enemy? Just as Sparky finds out what he wants in life, so does Bonnie. Will Sparky be a part of her future? With the threat of the Raging Riders hanging over them...who will survive? Biker Bait was about betrayal, Biker Faith is about learning to trust. For some, trust is not as easily earned as others.
