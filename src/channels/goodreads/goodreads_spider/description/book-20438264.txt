20438264:::::Loving Angel:::::Loving Angel isn t easy. Actually it is downright exhausting, but somehow she weaseled her way into my life. She has become my everything my reason for existing my reason for breathing. I love the ever-loving crap out of Angel Eyes. There is nothing I wouldn t endure for her even college. College. Ugh. I hope the frat boys, the jocks, and the nerds are prepared for what is about to embark on their school this fall. Half-demons. Hunters. And umm, the Keystone? Yeah, that is going to take getting used to. We aren t exactly your average freshman. And somehow I find myself stuck with a bunch of troublesome females to look after. Angel. Emma. Lexi. Pretty sure I got the raw end of the stick. But that isn t the worst of it. There is someone lurking in the shadows, spying and stalking my girlfriend. He is a dead man. How many people am I going to have to kill for this girl? A better question would be how many people wouldn t I kill for her? As many as it took. Angel is about to experience betrayal of the worst kind. And this time, it s not entirely my fault shocker.
