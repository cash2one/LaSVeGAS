16176476:::::A Highlander In Her Past:::::How bad could one little spell be? Trish Sullivan, archeologist and favorite aunt to the MacKay children, never thought she'd regret those words until Ramsay, the eldest MacKay lad, hurls them back to the 1400s with a botched transportation spell. Now she and Ramsay must find a way back before accidentally altering the past and unknowingly changing the future. That is, if Trish can survive the first trip across time without losing her life...or her heart. What harm could come from a little soul-binding? Proving his Highland honor alive and well, Maxwell Sullivan agrees to bind his soul to Trish's in order to save her life. But Highland honor isn't much help when Maxwell loses his heart in the bargain to the sassy woman headed back to the future.
