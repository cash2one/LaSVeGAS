The prize money is big, the bulls are rank, and the women are willing. But something is missing. For Slade, waking up in a different city with a different woman each morning is holding less and less appeal. Even Mustang s creative attempts to shake things up don t help. Then along comes a big-city author who s like nothing they ve ever encountered. Something about her makes Slade sit up and take notice and Mustang is always up for anything. Romance writer Jenna Block has a problem: her agent thinks a cowboy book will jump start her career. A born New Yorker, Jenna doesn t do cowboys, not on paper, and definitely not in real life. Luckily for her there are two cowboys ready, willing and able to take her out of her comfort zone in every way that counts and some ways she hadn t counted on.
