43547:::::Rose of No Man's Land:::::Fourteen-year-old Trisha Driscoll is a gender-blurring, self-described loner whose family expects nothing of her. While her mother lies on the couch in a hypochondriac haze and her sister aspires to be on The Real World, Trisha struggles to find her own place among the neon signs, theme restau rants, and cookie-cutter chain stores of her hometown. After being hired and abruptly fired from the most popular clothing shop at the local mall, Trisha befriends a chain-smoking misfit named Rose, and her life shifts into manic overdrive. A postmillennial, class-adjusted My So-Called Life ( Publishers Weekly ), Rose of No Man s Land is brim ming with snarky observations and soulful musings on contemporary teenage America.
