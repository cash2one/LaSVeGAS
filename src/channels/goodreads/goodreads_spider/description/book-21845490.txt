21845490:::::Veiled Target:::::Never take Fate along on a date. The kiss goodnight could be deadly. Tracking down Veilers non humans is only a sideline for Tess Damon. Vengeance for her fianc s murder is her reason for living. But with two botched jobs on her record, if she fails to eliminate her next mark, she s dead. She s not afraid to die, but not before she gets even. Too bad fate has a really bad sense of humor. Hugh Langston, a wolfen half shifter, lives to keep both humans and his pack safe. But when rogue humans kidnap his apprentice, his rescue mission is compromised by a hot-as-hell, kick-ass woman who makes him think only one thing: mine. Tess tries to ignore her feelings, but temptation trips her up. Especially when Hugh figures out he s her next target and forces her into an inconvenient alliance that tests all the laws against their attraction. Now, with the line between good and evil getting blurrier by the minute, it becomes clear Tess s only hope of living to see another day and finding a murderer lies with the one man she s supposed to kill. Warning: Contains one obscenely hot alpha and the woman who wants to love him before she kills him. Look out for a blind date, scorching sex, humor, lies, and untamable attraction.
