2715056:::::Jack the Ripper: The Final Chapter:::::On 7 August 1889, an American woman, Florence Elizabeth Maybrick, was sentenced to death in a court in Liverpool, England, for a crime she did not commit. She was condemned for the murder of her husband. Her husband was Jack the Ripper.This book reveals how the largest and most detailed investigation ever undertaken on the subject of the Ripper Murders led the author to the story of Florence and how she was framed for the murder of her husband, James Maybrick, as part of an official cover which continues to this day. The key to this extraordinary story is the Diary Of Jack the Ripper. When this remarkable documents first came to light, Paul H. Feldman set out to prove that it was a hoax. He couldn't. In fact, the more he researched the Diary, the more he became convinced that it was genuine, that it was written by James Maybrick and that Maybrick was the Ripper. Now he has proved it. Feldman explains exactly why the Ripper murders always been shrouded in secrecy, why there was an official cover-up, why there have always been rumors of links to the British Royal Family, why there has always been speculation about Masonic involvement and why an innocent American was sentenced to death for a crime that she did not commit. As well as providing the long-awaited solution to one of the most enduring mysteries in the history of crime, this is a story about real people. Feldman's research draws in people alive today who are descended from Florence, and others descended from James Maybrick the living descendants of Jack The Ripper.
