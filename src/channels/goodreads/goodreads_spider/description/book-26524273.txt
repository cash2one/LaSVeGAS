26524273:::::It Happened on Munger Street: A Spiritual Journey Into Awakening:::::This book was written so the experience could be shared and not forgotten. I met Samuel by chance on an online dating site, and with a leap of faith, I got up the courage to write to him in 2011. We were total strangers on this dating site, but when he wrote back a few days later, we began an online conversation that would last over three years. Samuel led me down a new path spiritually that would eventually change the course of my life. The experience was amazing! This book will take you on an inspirational spiritual journey of a single mother still lost after a painful divorce in 2002 and how she and her two children learned to cope and eventually begin again. It's said that people come into and out of our lives for a reason. I have taken those words rather lightly over the years, not fully understanding their profound meaning. But it's true; people come into our lives, it seems, right when we need them the most. How does this happen, and who sends them? Why do they send them? Samuel guided me to a better existence, never asking for anything in return. Who does that for a perfect stranger? Miracles do happen!
