6086315:::::The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Century 1910:::::One of Three. The new volume chronicling the exploits of Wilhelmina Murray and her extraordinary colleagues, Century is an epic spanning almost a hundred years. Divided into three 80-page chapters -- each a self-contained narrative to avoid frustrating cliffhanger delays between episodes -- this monumental tale takes place in three distinct eras, building to an apocalyptic conclusion occurring in our own, current, twenty-first century. Chapter One is set against the backdrop of London, 1910, twelve years after the failed Martian invasion and nine years since England put a man on the moon. In the bowels of the British Museum, Carnacki the ghost-finder is plagued by visions of a shadowy occult order who are attempting to create something called a Moonchild, while on London's dockside the most notorious serial murderer of the previous century has returned to carry on his grisly trade. Working for Mycroft Holmes' British Intelligence alongside a rejuvenated Allan Quartermain, the reformed thief Anthony Raffles and the eternal warrior Orlando, Miss Murray is drawn into a brutal opera acted out upon the waterfront by players that include the furiously angry Pirate Jenny and the charismatic butcher known as Mac the Knife.
