7047802:::::Marilyn Monroe:::::Beautiful, sexy, funny, and talented, Marilyn Monroe was an icon, not only for America, but for the world. Typecast as the original dumb blonde, she gained fame in classic movies like Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, The Seven Year Itch, and How to Marry a Millionaire. She married America s greatest sporting hero and then one of America s most renowned intellectuals before wowing critics with her performance in Bus Stop . She won a Golden Globe Award for her role in Some Like it Hot and seemingly privately serenaded the President of the United States in front of tens of thousands at Madison Square Garden. This is the unseen and the beloved Marilyn from her unhappy childhood to her tragic death who is still touching the hearts of millions.
