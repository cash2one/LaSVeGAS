10694746:::::The Programmed Man:::::The Programmed Man tells the story of Daniel York, a Empire Intelligence agent who is rushed aboard an Imperial Navy destroyer in response to an emergency after an Imperial starcruiser unexpectedly goes missing while on patrol. The outcast mutants of the hellish Zuman worlds and the arrogant upstart Prince Li-Hu are suspects, but neither York nor his gruff companion, Captain Daniel Hull of the Empire destroyer Draco, truly know what to expect when they go in search of the missing cruiser.
