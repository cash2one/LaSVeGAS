151390:::::The Letters of Abelard and Heloise:::::The story of the relationship between Ab lard and H lo se is one of the world s most celebrated and tragic love affairs. It is told through the letters of Peter Ab lard, a French philosopher and one of the greatest logicians of the twelfth century, and of his gifted pupil H lo se. Through their impassioned writings unfolds the story of a romance, from its reckless, ecstatic beginnings through to public scandal, an enforced secret marriage and its devastating consequences. These eloquent and intimate letters express a vast range of emotions from adoration and devotion to reproach, indignation and grief, and offer a fascinating insight into religious life in the Middle Ages. This is the revised edition of Betty Radice's highly regarded translation, in which Michael Clanchy, the biographer of Ab lard, updates the scholarship on the letters and the lovers. This volume includes Ab lard's remarkable autobiography and his spiritual advice to H lo se and her nuns, as well as a selection of the 'lost love letters' of Ab lard and H lo se, letters between H lo se and Peter the Venerable, two of Ab lard's hymns, a chronology, notes and maps.
