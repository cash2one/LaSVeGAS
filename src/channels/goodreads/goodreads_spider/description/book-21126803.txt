21126803:::::Another Year in Oman: Between Iraq and a Hard Place...:::::In the second of a three book series describing his life in the Middle East after the tragic events of September 11th, 2001, the author finds he is alone again in the remote regions of Arabia. Rather inadvertently,the author becomes even further immersed in the Arab and Muslim culture of the Sultanate of Oman. Through his experiences, the author is able to describe to the casual reader the roles of women, especially their limitations and value in Arab and Muslim society. Through a number of sometimes humorous and other times, tragically pathetic schemes to maintain a sense of belonging in a world where he doesn t really belong in the first place, the author finds himself in the middle of a surrealistic liaison that no one can be sure is real, not even him! To make matters worse, the U.S. is gearing up for an invasion of Iraq to the north and everyone is looking at him (the only American in the region) with even greater suspicion. He also finds that there are a number of Iraqis who cannot wait for the U.S. to invade and free them from the tyranny of Saddam Hussein. He finds that in a world of lies, deceit and hatred, there are still people, specifically the people of Oman, who are kind and caring and who have come to consider him a part of their family... ...But is it real, or is it just a dream?
