6518202:::::Breaking Free:::::Beth must yield to become aroused, but she's too scared to give up control. The last thing she wants is a ruthless, powerful Dom. But that's just what she gets, and exactly what she needs... A sadistic husband left Beth scarred, inside and out. Only at the Shadowlands BDSM club does she feel like a woman. But her fears limit her to Doms who won't overwhelm her the very ones who cannot arouse her. The Master of the Shadowlands gives her an ultimatum: accept the Dom he assigns or lose her membership. The last thing Beth wants is a ruthless, powerful Dom, but that's just what she gets. Asked to take on a problem sub, Nolan sees the issue immediately although truly submissive, the little redhead is too scared to relinquish control and her Doms have let her get away with it. That will change right now. As Master Nolan takes Beth under command, compelling her submission, she's terrified, but the experienced Dom brings her pleasure, not pain. His only demand is that she never lie to him. Under his capable hands, her body comes alive, and she begins to heal. As he pushes her limits, she learns to trust...and then to love. And she realizes he is beginning to care for her in return. But now her cruel husband has found her, and Master Nolan discovers she's been lying and lying and lying...
