181427:::::The Becoming:::::Lately Tianna has been feeling unsettled and she can't understand why. She has a great boyfriend, good friends, and for once a good foster situation too. But she just can't shake the thought that something, or someone, is after her. At a skateboarding competition she runs into Justin and Mason-now Outcasts who no longer seem to recognize her. They keep telling her that they have to help her before she "becomes." She has no idea what they mean, but deep down Tianna feels herself changing. She knows that every Daughter has a dark side, but is hers threatening to overtake her?
