31696574:::::Travesty:::::Waking up in a house she doesn t recognize, sixteen-year-old, Sophia Sawyer, tries not to let the blankness of her mind terrorize her from the inside out. How can she not know who she is? How has she ended up chained in a basement? Trying to work through her fear, she sets her sights on escaping. When an opportunity arises, she puts her trust in a boy she doesn t know, praying he will save her life. At age four, Abram Scott learned life owes him nothing, while fourteen taught him how to throw a punch and take one. Seventeen though seventeen provides him with the best and worst year of his life. Before he is old enough to fight for his country, he will escape his own personal hell, save a life, live a lie, break the law, fall in love, betray that love then lose it. Letting Sophia go while not knowing if she will return, turns into the scariest decision Abram will ever make. But that s the problem with living a lie; at some point, you have to decide which one is your truth.
