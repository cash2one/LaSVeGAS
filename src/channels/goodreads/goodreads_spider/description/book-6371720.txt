6371720:::::Powerless:::::Superheroes soar in this promising debut and they re kids! Twelve-year-old Daniel, the new kid in town, soon learns the truth about his nice but odd new friends: one can fly, another can turn invisible, yet another controls electricity. Incredible. The superkids use their powers to secretly do good in the town, but they re haunted by the fact that the moment they turn thirteen, their abilities will disappear along with any memory that they ever had them. Is a memory-stealing supervillain sapping their powers? The answers lie in a long-ago meteor strike, a World War II era comic book ( Fantastic Futures, starring the first superhero, Johnny Noble), the green-flamed Witch Fire, a hidden Shroud cave, and possibly, unbelievably powerless regular-kid Daniel himself. Superhero kids meet comic book mystery in this action-filled debut about the true meaning of a hero. Book Details: Format: Hardcover Publication Date: 10/27/2009 Pages: Reading Level: Age 10 and Up
