2175264:::::The Letters of the Reverend Patrick Bronte:::::Patrick Bronte was the father of arguably the most famous literary family in the world, with his three daughter's names ranked among the greatest of writers. Their life in the Haworth Parsonage is one that still holds a fascination a century and a half after their deaths and is subject to more than little myth-making. Patrick Bronte in this mythology is often castigated as a cold and even uncaring figure who dominated the lives of his more famous children. However, in this, the first ever complete collection of his surviving letters, some of which have never been published before, Dudley Green helps rehabilitate his subject's reputation and shows him to be a tolerant and attentive father. A prolific writer, he was an energetic campaigner on a wide range of religious, social and political issues. His letters reveal an educated man, passionate about his causes but, furthermore, in a family beset by so much tragedy, they reveal a very human side to this misunderstood man.
