13623149:::::Fire in the Hole: Stories:::::In this superb short fiction collection, Elmore Leonard, the greatest crime writer of our time, perhaps ever ( New York Times Book Review ), once again illustrates how the line between the law and the lawbreakers is not as firm as we might think. In the title story, the basis for the hit FX series Justified , U.S. Marshal Raylan Givens meets up with an old friend, but they re now on different sides of the law. Federal marshal Karen Sisco, from Out of Sight , returns in Karen Makes Out, once again inadvertently mixing pleasure with business. In When the Women Come Out to Dance, Mrs. Mahmood gets more than she bargains for when she conspires with her maid to end her unhappy marriage. These nine stories are the great Elmore Leonard at his vivid, hilarious, and unfailingly human best.
