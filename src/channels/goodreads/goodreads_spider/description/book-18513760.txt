18513760:::::200 Golden Hadith:::::Get this book from iBook store by following URL http://goo.gl/eNxGwd Every Muslim is aware of the importance of the Prophet s hadiths. Islam is based on two major sources: the Qur an and the Sunnah, and the latter is available to us in the form of hadiths. The Prophet said, Whoever comes to know one hadith of mine should spread it. However, the Prophet also told us to be careful when spreading his hadiths so as not to alter any component of it, otherwise, he can take his seat in the hellfire. Within this book I have incorporated 200 small hadiths of the Prophet. The reason for choosing the smaller hadiths of the Prophets is so that the youth can easily become accustomed to the words of the Prophet. All the hadiths concern the important matters of the religion, which every person should have knowledge of. I have come to the realization that many youth from among the Muslims have not memorized even one hadith of the Prophet. For this reason I have chosen smaller hadiths so that they can be easily memorized by them and they can spread them to others. This way our relatives and our friends can memorize some words of the Prophet which will bring them benefit in the hereafter. This book has purposely not been organized into any specific categories. Experience through the years has taught me that this style of non-categorization is easier for the general masses who are not scholars or students of knowledge. I am also aware that many languages exists out there in which the hadiths of the Prophet have not yet been translated. This is why, Allah-willing, my intention is to have this small work translated into at least 30 different languages.
