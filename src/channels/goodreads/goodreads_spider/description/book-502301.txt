502301:::::A Non-Blonde Cheerleader in Love:::::The Sand Dune High cheerleading squad has gone coed, and not everyone is happy about it. Annisa's psyched when her boyfriend signs up, and stunting with the guys is pretty cool. But then the battle of the sexes heats up, and Annisa is caught in the middle. Can one non-blonde figure out a way to keep the girls from killing the guys, or will the battle turn into an all-out cheer war? Following the excitement of nationals in Brunettes Strike Back, the further drama of the star of I Was a Non-Blonde Cheerleader (an ALA Quick Pick and NYPL Book for the Teen Age) is just as entertaining as ever.
