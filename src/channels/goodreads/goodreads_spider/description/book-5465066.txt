5465066:::::Undead and Unwelcome:::::"Ms. Davidson has her own brand of wit and shocking surprises that make her vampire series on of a kind" ( Darque Reviews ). And heroine Betsy Taylor has problems that only a suburban vampire-queen housewife could possibly understand, such as... FIFTY THOUSAND ANGRY WEREWOLVES. That's what Betsy is facing when she takes her werewolf friend Antonia's body to Cape Cod, where the Pack resides at Wyndham Manor. Because Antonia died in her service, Betsy is alive and well and wracked with guilt. She has no idea if the Wyndham werewolves will greet her with fangs or friendship. While Betsy and her husband, Sinclair, try to make nice, their legal ward, BabyJon, freaks out every werewolf he meets. Meanwhile, Betsy's posse back at the St. Paul mansion is not LOLing. Increasingly frantic e-mails alert Betsy to her half sister's increasingly erratic behavior. Looks like the devil's daughter is coming into her own and raising hell. All in the name of making Betsy's life easier, of course.
