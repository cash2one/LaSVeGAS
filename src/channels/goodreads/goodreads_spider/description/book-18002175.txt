Susanna Truitt never dreamed of a great romance or being treated like a princess---just to marry the man she has loved for twelve years. But life isn t going according to plan. When her high-school-sweetheart-turned-Marine-officer breaks up instead of proposing, Susanna scrambles to rebuild her life. The last thing Prince Nathaniel expects to find on his American holiday to St. Simon s Island is the queen of his heart. A prince has duties, and his family s tense political situation has chosen his bride for him. When Prince Nathaniel comes to Susanna s aid under the fabled Lover s Oak, he is blindsided by love. Their lives are worlds apart. He s a royal prince. She s a ordinary girl. But everything changes when Susanna receives an invitation to Nathaniel s coronation.
