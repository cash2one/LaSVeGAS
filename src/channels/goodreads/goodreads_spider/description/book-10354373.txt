10354373:::::The Reaping:::::Librarian Note: Alternate/new cover edition for ASIN# B004LGS772. Every hell has its devil. And Carson is about to become intimately acquainted with hers. Seventeen-year-old wallflower Carson Porter has always dreamed of being something special, but what she gets isn t what she signed up for. Yeah, a girl s supposed to change as she gets older, but this is ridiculous! Shiny skin, greener eyes and a run-in with the flesh-eating dead are just a few of the changes Carson has to adjust to, not to mention the arrival of very hot and very dangerous Derek Hrolf. If all that wasn t enough to turn her once hum-drum life into something unrecognizable, a twin sister that haunts her from the shadows and a wheeling, dealing collector of souls will definitely do the trick. The question is: what will her life become? And what will she become?
