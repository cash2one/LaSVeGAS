864316:::::White Noise:::::Jack Gladney, who is chairman of the department of Hitler studies at Blacksmith College, is afraid of death. So is Babette, who 'gathers and tends the children'. Also afraid of death is Jack's son, Heinrich Gerhardt, whose best friend is training to break the world endurance record for sitting in a cage full of deadly snakes. That Hitler and death and poisonous snakes are so prominent in 'White Noise' does not prevent it from being one of DeLillo's funniest novels to date. And that it is so funny doesn't mean it isn't eerie, brilliant, touching and as serious as death.
