22842297:::::The Bridge To Caracas:::::Librarian Note: Alternate Cover Edition for ASIN: B00DJ5GM14 . How was an incredible $325,000,000 theft achieved using The Peace Bridge as a fulcrum? It was a piece of national history. The story had to be told. One of the largest and most audacious gasoline tax evasion scams in Canadian and U.S. history. The perpetrator used The Peace Bridge, spanning The Niagara River, to facilitate his crime, and his private Cessna to transport the enormous fruits of the theft to the safety of a Cayman Island bank. The scam netted an amount that makes The New York State Lottery look like a Sunday school collection. Cynical and remorselessly ruthless, the thief possesses a brilliant criminal mind, has enormous contempt for the law, police, governments, and the system in which they function. He assumes rules are for fools, and takes sadistic pleasure in breaking them.
