17085296:::::The Life and Times of the Heir and the Keeper:::::They say college is a lot of things; a haven, a four-year party, the place you met the girl or guy of your dreams. What they don t tell you is, the best part of college is the drama YOU bring to the table! After all, that dirty little secret, that not-so-little white lie, and those texts you wish you could erase from cyberspace can t stay hidden forever. At CU, someone s always watching, and you better hope there isn t a camera phone on hand when you get caught. It s the Spring Semester, but it s not all fun in the budding sun for Jon and Franz. Follow them as they delve through the politics of secret societies, the inevitable drama of the F-word (that s FAMILY, for the uninitiated), creepy Resident Advisors, creepier residents and girls who don t always say what they mean. Who wouldn t need two months to recuperate? Cheers! And GL! Author Note: Get your FREE Copy today at Amazon! http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AFL4L04
