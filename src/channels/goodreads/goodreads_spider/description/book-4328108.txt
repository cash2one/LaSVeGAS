4328108:::::Mixed Blood:::::An American fugitive hides out in Cape Town one of the world s most beautiful and violent cities in this riveting debut thriller that asks: Can you ever outrun your past? Reluctant bank robber Jack Burn is on the run after a heist in the United States that left $3 million missing and one cop dead. Hiding out in Cape Town, South Africa, he is desperate to build a new life for his pregnant wife and young son. But on a tranquil evening in their new suburban neighborhood they are the victims of a random gangland assault that changes everything. Benny Mongrel, an ex-con night watchman guarding a building site next to Burn s home, is another man desperate to escape his past. After years in the ghetto gangs of Cape Town he knows who went into Burn s house. And what the American did to them. He also knows his only chance to save his own brown skin is to forget what he saw. Burn s actions on that night trap them both in a cat-and-mouse game with Rudi "Gatsby" Barnard a corrupt Afrikaner cop who loves killing almost as much as he loves Jesus Christ and Disaster Zondi, a fastidious Zulu detective who wishes to settle an old score. Once Gatsby smells those missing American millions, the four men are drawn into a web of murder and vengeance that builds to an unforgettable conclusion.
