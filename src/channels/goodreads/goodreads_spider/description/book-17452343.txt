17452343:::::Playing With Her Heart:::::A standalone romance from #1 New York Times Bestselling Author Lauren Blakely... He's sexy, sophisticated, possessive...and my boss. I'm trying to resist him, I swear. I'm good at resisting, and at playing pretend too. It's what I do for a living. But as Davis Milo directs me in my first Broadway play, I'm having a harder time pretending that I don't want him to take me. On the piano. In the limo. In the dressing room. Anywhere and everywhere. And the more he guides me through staged kisses, the more I want them to be real. *** I damn well know the first rule of directing: Never fall for your leading lady. But I'm captivated by her raw talent, and fighting this desire grows harder every day I spend with her. Keeping things professional isn't an option. I want all of her. Soon we're staying late in the empty theatre, our private rehearsals spiraling into new, forbidden territory. I swear I'm not playing with her heart, but how can I be sure that what she feels is real, and not a part of the play?
