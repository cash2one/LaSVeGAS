35904088:::::Scoundrels Volume One:::::Spanning much of the 20th Century and revolving around the infamous gentlemen's club of London, Scoundrels is the jaw-dropping memoirs of disreputable spies Majors Cornwall and Trevelyan. The Majors recount scandalous tales of murder on Everest, panda hunting with the last Chinese Emperor and the theft of a uniquely sordid item from the Nazi fortress Klunghammer. But why have they been under house arrest for over thirty years? Historically accurate, morally questionable and absolutely true, Scoundrels is one part Flashman to two parts Mordecai Trilogy, stirred vigorously and dashed in the face of Ian Fleming. It will leave you with a nasty taste in your mouth and horribly hungover.
