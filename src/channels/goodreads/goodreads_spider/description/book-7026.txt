7026:::::The Hatchling:::::Beneath a shadowed moon in a cloud-streaked sky, the sacred orb splits and a hatching is born: It is Nyroc, son of Kludd, fallen leader of the Pure Ones, and his evil mate, Nyra.

But doubt grows in Nyroc's heart, fed by strange forbidden legends of a great tree far away where noble owls live in peace. And a light dawns in Nyroc's gizzard, nourished by friendship. A day is nearing when Nyroc must choose to fulfill his destiny-or defy it. It will be a day of blood and terror.
