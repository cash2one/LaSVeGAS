9058924:::::Desperate Hearts:::::Chantel Aubuchon is Mayor of Elkhorn. Taking on the job handed down to her from her father, she manages her position with pride as she attempts to keep her town afloat. But when gold is discovered on the Powder River she soon finds her small town threatened by the approaching mines. Destruction of the land surrounding her town is slowly turning Elkhorn into a ghost town. Searching for a way to insure her town s survival she resorts to desperate measures. Harper Barnes is the source of Elkhorn s problem. Owning nearly all the mines along the river, he is the only one that can stop the destruction before it reaches her town. In her desperation, Chantel finds herself hidden underneath a bandana and behind a pistol. Little does she know that by robbing the man responsible for her town s demise she will set off a series of events that will not only prove to her that first impressions should never be trusted, but that love can oftentimes be found where we least expect it.
