29144691:::::Submerging:::::There is nothing like a birthday to give Hamilton Dinger something to look forward to in his busy life. With his new job as a part-time intern at the Mayor's office, being a full-time high school student and Starlight Warrior has its challenges. And although he has the full support of his girlfriend, Gwen, and his best friend, Mikey, and even a tentative partnership with Starry Knight, his ally against the Seven Deadly Sinisters, he has definite cause for concern. The arrival of SWORD, the growing demonic activity in Apollo City, and the increasingly negative media attention has sparked ongoing unrest among the city and its inhabitants. But Hamilton has some additional help in Aletheia, a new supernatural ally, who has come to equip Hamilton for his calling to be a Starlight defender. With the help of the crew of the Meallan and its captain, St. Brendan the Navigator, and Aletheia's sister, the Star of Time, Elysian and Hamilton set off for the Celestial Kingdom to deepen his commitment through learning, new landscapes, and cosmic surfing. As evil forces continue in their quest for power and control, Hamilton finds uncertainty and distrust between his two worlds. Can he find the answers that will help him? Will he find the strength he needs to carry on? Will Wingdinger realize the importance of his choices, and more importantly-make the right ones?"
