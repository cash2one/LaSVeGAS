421736:::::Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal:::::Wyatt Earp was the greatest gun-fighting marshal of the Old West, and in his time he was branded both a hero - and a killer. With his brothers Morgan and Virgil, and sidekick Doc Holliday, Wyatt Earp brought law and order to the frontier outposts of Wichita, Dodge City, and Tombstone. He went mano a mano with the era's most notorious outlaws, but he always said he never shot a man he didn't have to. Today he stands for the wild adventure, reckless courage, and forty-five caliber justic of America's cowboy days.
