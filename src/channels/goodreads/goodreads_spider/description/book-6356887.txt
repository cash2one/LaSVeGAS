6356887:::::My Miracle:::::My Miracle was first started about 8 years ago (around 2000). I wrote about 5,000 words, showed it to a couple of friends, and then put it away with all my other paper work and notes. About 4 years after that I got a phone call from a friend who was working at HealthSouth Rehabilitation Center and told me about a video tape she had found with me in it. Now, up to this point it had been about 12 years since my accident. So, I drove up to the center, got the VCR tape, went home to watch it, and could not believe it was me. Well, within a couple of months the VCR tape got put away with all the other tapes. And then last year, I got a new job at a school working with alternative children and teens. I had only been working there for a few months when the staff received the notice of our school being closed by the county. This young man to whom I became friends with started talking about his book that was just published. I quickly mentioned to him about my story I wrote, but did not finish. He replied, "Why don't you finish it?" That was when he reached for his phone and called his publisher, Authorhouse. I spoke to a very helpful young woman who gave me the information that I needed. From that point on I went home and finished my book adding about 15,000 more words. I simply added to the 5,000 words that were already there. It was like I had already formed the outline. For a very long time, I always wanted to tell the world about my life changing experiences, but never really had the opportunity until now...
