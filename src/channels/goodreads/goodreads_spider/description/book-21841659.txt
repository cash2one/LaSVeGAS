21841659:::::A Unique Kind of Love:::::Lena Rose Winter is a typical seventeen year old girl, or so everyone thought. She has a secret, something she hates talking about. She knew what love is, and she dreads it especially after losing someone close to her heart. Liam Christopher Black is far from your typical bad boy. He's a good guy, the one who sits at the back of the class, not making any sound. They say that time heals everything, but he's nowhere near being healed especially after the news of his family dying in a car crash traumatized him enough for him to lose his voice. Becoming friends with someone is a risk, because you could always end up caring too much, but Lena is willing to face it. She fought for the boy and for his friendship that they ended up falling for each other. HARD. It seemed as if the world don't want them together as they face struggle after struggle to beat the odds. But will the risks be enough for their relationship to survive? And amidst the trials and bad experiences, will both of them learn to truly love again?
