6992584:::::A Field Guide for Heartbreakers:::::Best friends Dessy and Veronica arrive in Europe with wildly different plans. Dessy hopes to heal her newly broken heart by diving into the creative writing workshop that brought the girls to Prague. Veronica s plan, meanwhile, is to conquer as many hot-dudes as possible in one month and help Dessy recycle her heart in the process. Her method: Dress like you are the party. Explore the terrain.

Well, no one ever said breaking hearts was a simple craft .
