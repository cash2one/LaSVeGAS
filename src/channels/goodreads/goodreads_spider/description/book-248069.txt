248069:::::Child of All Nations:::::In Child of All Nations, the reader is immediately swept up by a story that is profoundly feminist, devastatingly anticolonialist and full of heartbreak, suspense, love, and fury. Pramoedya immerses the reader in a world that is astonishing in its vividness: the cultural whirlpool that was the Dutch East Indies of the 1890s. A story of awakening, it follows Minke, the main character of This Earth of Mankind, as he struggles to overcome the injustice all around him. Pramoedya s full literary genius is evident in the brilliant characters that populate this world: Minke s fragile Mixed-Race wife; a young Chinese revolutionary; an embattled Javanese peasant and his impoverished family; the French painter Jean Marais, to name just a few.
