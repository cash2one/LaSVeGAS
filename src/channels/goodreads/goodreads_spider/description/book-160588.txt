160588:::::The Abortion:::::The Abortion is a genre novel parody about a California library which accepts books in any form &amp; from all who wish to donate children submit crayoned tales of toys; teens of angst &amp; elders drop of memoirs "the unwanted, the lyrical &amp; haunted volumes of American writing". Summoned by a silver bell at all hours, submissions are cataloged by librarian's discretion; not by Dewey, but by placement on whatever magically dust-free shelf serves best in an author's judgment. Then Vida appears. Awkwardly shy, she's described as the world's most beautiful woman. Admen "would have made into a national park if they would have gotten their hands on her." Falling for the reclusive librarian, she gets pregnant &amp; goes to Tijuana for an abortion.
