13557068:::::The Ugly Little Bloke:::::Matt Fisher is just starting to get used to life as one of the Latchkey kids, exploring and protecting Tanglewood, the House of Doors. So when an ugly little man named Grinder pops up in the House and begs them to help his people avoid being trampled by two opposing armies, Matt s all for it. Kaitlyn is the youngest of the Latchkeys, but possibly the most powerful. She tends to respond instinctively to situations, relying upon luck and spunk and quick wits to see her through. But when she gets outraged at Grinder s plight, and steps up to help his village, the consequences may be more than she bargained for.
