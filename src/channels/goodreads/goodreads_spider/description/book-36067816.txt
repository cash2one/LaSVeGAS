36067816:::::Karina's Silver Shoes:::::She s got the fate of a kingdom in her hands or rather, in her shoes. 14-year old Karina is not sure what she wants, but she knows what she s found: fascinating silver shoes. Fascinating, dangerous, and potentially evil. On the upside, they do bring cool visitors. When two princesses ask her to go to Whyland, a kingdom in a parallel dimension, to destroy the shoes, of course Karina accepts. Who would refuse a free trip to an alternate world? Advised by a wise master and threatened by a beautiful stepmother, Karina goes on a journey with a princess to defeat a powerful witch. But Whyland is nothing like she expected. Karina finds herself stuck in a kingdom she doesn t understand, with no clue on who to trust. Before saving anyone, she d better save herself if she figures out how. From Brazilian / Canadian writer Denise Marques Leitao comes Karina s Silver Shoes, a teen parody of fantasy and fairy-tale tropes with many female characters, friendships between girls and women, and some subtle romance.
