9661513:::::The Turf-Cutter's Donkey:::::Now back in print and available in paperback. Patricia Lynch (1898-1972) is widely regarded as one of Ireland's best (and best-loved) children's authors. This book was originally published in 1934 and was the first in a series in which the Irish landscape was lovingly evoked. Lynch has been described as a "master at recapturing the Irish character and landscape" (Irish Literary Supplement). In this story of mystery and adventure we follow the exploits of Seamus and Eileen, who live in a whitewashed cottage at the end of the bog where their father works as a turf-cutter. One day they are befriended by a donkey, who leads them into a series of extraordinary adventures and encounters with strange people. An enchanted teapot, the leprechaun, the little dark man, the golden eagle, the salmon of Knowledge, and Finn and the ancient heroes all appear to share in the great adventure. A classic of children's literature, it remains one of the most magical and exciting of Irish fantasies.
