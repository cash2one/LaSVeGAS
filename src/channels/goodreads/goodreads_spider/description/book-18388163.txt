18388163:::::Nightmarish Sacrifice:::::Unpredictable. Symbolic. Mysterious. NIGHTMARISH SACRIFICE. A sinister nightmare repeats for the thirteenth time in a row. A sacrificed ghost is weeping on her own abandoned grave, disturbing Freya's dreams... and secret nightmares. A mask of invincibility is rising between a boy and the girl who loves him. Hypnotizing and intense, penetratingly gray as dead starless skies, Cardew's brutally beautiful eyes block his soul behind themselves like lurid mystifying mirrors that can flawlessly reflect others' feelings without showing any of his own... Assuming he ever had such. Nobody knows what hides behind his mask of a hero - least of all his lovely Freya, who lets her obsessions disguised as intuition lead her into his mesmerising labyrinth of insanity and love. When a million masks become the actor's face and they all explode in a single moment, what happens to his uncompromising pride? Best enemies can make the best of friends - but the worst of lovers. Unusual, tempting, and sinisterly beautiful, NIGHTMARISH SACRIFICE is written in a luxurious, excessive Gothic style, imaginatively elaborating on the invisible in its restlessly unpredictable story. At eleven o'clock in the graveyard, you can meet the truth in faces you haven't expected. But some truths are better off dead. And buried.
