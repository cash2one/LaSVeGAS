27416068:::::Man of Honor:::::The best rules are the ones worth breaking . . . After his mother's funeral, ex-Army Ranger Drake Sullivan wants only to disappear and drown his sorrows in whiskey. Then he sees her: Mea Jones. An untamed, sexy-as-hell whirlwind of energy. A few years ago, she showed him the best-and hottest-night of his life, then walked away without a backward glance. But he's never stopped wanting more. When it comes to guys, Mea has rules. One night. No dating. Whatever it takes to have control and keep it. With Drake, it's all heat and hurt and hunger, and pretty much the opposite of control. And that makes him dangerous as hell. Mea has her own demons, and falling in love-or even in lust-is strictly a no-go proposition. But she soon finds out Drake is incredibly single-minded when it comes to getting what he wants. And he's determined to be the exception to all her rules. Reader advisory: The heroine's past deals with dark elements some readers may find disturbing. Recommended for mature audiences only.
