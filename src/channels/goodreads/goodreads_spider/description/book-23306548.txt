23306548:::::Vandal:::::** Please note - this book was re-edited in March of 2016 and the ending was given more depth and clarification. Thank you! She takes my breath away; she is so beautifully damaged. Yes I had broken her, ravished her life, destroyed her happiness. I brought her to ultimate despair. I was responsible for all the pain and suffering that now brought her to her knees in front of me. Broken. Hopeless. Reckless in her agony. She is a mirror of my own tortured soul. But what I took away I can give back. In ways she cannot even begin to imagine. She is everything right in all my wrongs. She loves me. She needs me. She has no idea I m the one who wrecked her life. ** Vandal is a dark romance with light BDSM. He is emotionally damaged and manipulative, but still wants love. This book deals with death, grief, deception, substance abuse, depression, and graphic sex. If this is not your thing, you can skip this book and move onto the next in the series and you will not be lost. Vandal is not the sweetheart that the other guys in Ashes &amp; Embers are - but even the dark and damaged deserve to be loved, right? **
