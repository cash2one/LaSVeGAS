28938376:::::Scout's Honor:::::A story of a self-lost... A self-loathed... And a self-rediscovered. In Haddleboro, North Carolina, Scout Webb is a 14-year-old kind, spirited small-town southern girl and a tomboy much like her namesake, the young narrator from her mother s favorite book. With both her name and her Christian faith deeply woven into the fabric of her identity, Scout always felt like she had a lot to live up to - she was the kind of girl who made her parents proud. It's August 1983, and Scout is playing on a summer baseball team with Charlie Porter, her best friend since kindergarten. More than anything, she is looking forward to her last few weeks at Camp Judah, a Christian camp near the Catawba River. She can t wait to see her big crush Brother Doug, the thirty-two-year-old camp lifeguard who has watched her grow up each summer since she was seven years old. But after a fateful few days and one catastrophic event during her last day at the camp, Scout will be changed forever.
