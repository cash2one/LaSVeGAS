18243368:::::This Could Have Been Our Song! A Coulda Woulda Shoulda Ballad:::::Book one: Love can be such a coulda, woulda, shoulda song sometimes Lucia Mpobo-Riddell could have been a dancer like the rest of women of her family but instead she chose music. Marcus Grant could have been a doctor like the rest of his family but instead he chose music. She also could have not fallen for Marcus on her birthday but she did. And Marcus, he could have told Lucia the truth about his real reason for being in Toronto that night, but he didn t. Now they have to deal with big reveals and consequences: Marcus almost stealing her job and being force to work on an album together. Marcus, because he couldn t swallow his pride, leave Toronto and go home to London. Lucia, because she just couldn t give up on her first amazing opportunity to produce a whole album. And to complicate the situation further, the band they re working for is not the easiest one. Mary Gillis, Marcus on and off flame, still has a hold on him. Greg McMullen, Lucia s close friend and former dance partner is back in town and has been in love with her for years. Then there s Marcus and Lucia, in the middle of their own a professional and personal tug-of- war with each over and the rest of the world. But maybe things could still work out All things considered, this could have been one heck of a love song!
