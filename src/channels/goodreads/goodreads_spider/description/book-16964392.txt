16964392:::::The Abominable Sruvius:::::As legend has it, Ravma Sruvius built a secret weapon high in the loft of his mysterious laboratory, and used it to sink half the royal navy. He was captured soon after, but even dungeon walls couldn t stop the rat-like villain from vanishing without a trace. Now, twenty years later, after young Bergey Fenwick and his friends overhear a plot of invasion against their kingdom, they uncover a trail of clues leading to the only person who can save them Ravma Sruvius himself. More powerful than ever, he now controls forces that make his last weapon look like a popgun by comparison. But can Sruvius callous, twisted, possessed of an overriding hatred for the king be coerced into using his incredible scientific genius to save their kingdom, or is he bent on destroying it? Or is it possible that he has an entirely different agenda something that no one could ever have guessed?
