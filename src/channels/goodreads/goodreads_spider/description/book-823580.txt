823580:::::A Rake's Vow:::::He vowed never to marry. She vowed no man would trap her. But some vows are meant to be broken... Vane Cynster greatly enjoys his dalliances, but he's always remained aloof when other Cynster men stepped up to the altar. Resolved to never submit to being leg-shackled to any woman, he believes hes found the ideal temporary refuge from London's infuriating husband hunters at Bellamy Hall. But an encounter with irresistible Patience Debbington has his head and his heart spinning...and soon he has more than mere seduction on his mind. But Patience is not about to succumb to arrogant, presumptuous Vane's sensuous propositions. Certainly his kisses leave her weak, and his caresses leave her flushed and burning with desire. But he is bound to be unfaithful just like every other man and despite his assurances, she will not trust the handsome, elegant rogue with her heart. But can a promise to resist temptation stand firm when passion demands otherwise?
