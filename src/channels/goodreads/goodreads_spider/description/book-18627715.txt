18627715:::::Sex Love Repeat:::::In Malibu, I sleep late in our worn out bed. Dance to Bob Marley in the sand. Find love and peace in Paul's arms. In Hollywood, I drink champagne and watch our chef fix dinner. I visit Stewart at work and let him take me on top of his desk. Two separate lives. Two separate men. A woman that watched us all. I should have known that it wouldn't work out.
