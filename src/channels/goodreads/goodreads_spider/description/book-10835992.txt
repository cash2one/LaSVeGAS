10835992:::::Darkness & Light:::::Jem Stonehouse, a housewife with a neurotic husband bent on keeping her in line, dreams about werewolves in, what she believes, is a bid to escape boredom. Sean Holloway is a werewolf, living a charade within the human race, whose mind drifts to a bond he shares with a woman he hasn't met--at least, not in this lifetime. Apart, the two are safe but live unfulfilled lives. Together, they'll become prey to rival packs just as they have been for hundreds of years. When their worlds collide, and not for the first time, instinct takes over. Dreams become reality. Futures are uncertain. To keep history from repeating itself, Sean must teach Jem about his heritage, convince her of her role, and win her love. Can Jem accept her destiny before it's too late, or is her inner wolf buried too deep to save her future with Sean?
