995157:::::Teenage Tales:::::Fifteen-year-old Jeremy Duncan is the heart and soul of puberty. A typical teen, Jeremy is shy, self-absorbed, and bored. He loves hanging out and playing the guitar, and is constantly befuddled at his parents' uncoolness. He lives in the shadow of his older brother's perfect 4.0 grade-point-average, star athlete, flawless complexion image. Jeremy's girlfriend, Sara, loves that she can get him to do anything for her. His best friends are Hector and Pierce, whom he's known for-almost-ever. His parents? Uncool baby boomers. (Unless you're a parent. Then they are two suburban professionals trying to do the best they can with a teenager going through that "awkward" phase.) The enormously popular comic strip Zits&gt;/i&gt; depicts teenage and parental angst like no other.
