2494990:::::The Forget Me Not Sonata:::::Spread over two generations, THE FORGET-ME-NOT SONATA is based in the English Colony of Hurlingham in Argentina and in Dorset from the 1940s to the present day. A sweeping story following the life of Audrey Garnet who grows up in the small Anglo-Argentine community where the gossiping ladies of the Hurlingham Club divulge and discuss the latest scandals over scones and Earl Grey tea. Ripples pass through the community when Cecil and Louis Forrester arrive to make their fortunes. Cecil is a decorated war hero while Louis, who didn't fight, thrashes out his tormented soul on the grand piano and hides a dark secret that only his brother knows. Audrey loses her heart to one, but marries the other and yet her love only intensifies over the years and the music of the forget-me-not sonata reminds her time and again of the dreadful sacrifice she has made.
