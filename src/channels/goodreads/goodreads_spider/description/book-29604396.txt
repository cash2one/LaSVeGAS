He s a happy bear shifter, building furniture and being alone until a little curvy woman literally crashes into his life. When he pulls her from her car after she wraps it around a tree, he is blindsided by the connection. Never before has he wanted a mate, but finding Lola changes all that. Lola didn t plan on her deadbeat mom blowing the rent and then skipping town, so she s without a home. Again. But this time it s going to be different. Hearing whispers of shifters in Grayslake, she takes off in search of something, anything, that can bring some light to her life. When her car slips and she ends up in danger, she never expects her rescuer to be the one to give her everything she s ever wanted. Will being snowed in lead to steamy nights and mating bites? You betcha! Warning: This is a short shifter story filled with sweet cheesy possessiveness and lots of growling. Obviously. Go ahead and read it. You know you want to!
