18798988:::::Break Me:::::Would you kill for the one you love? I crashed into his life, ripped apart the walls he had so carefully erected...fueled a passion that he never knew could exist, but his troubled past has come back to haunt us. I yearn to know his secrets, yearn for him to surrender to me as I have surrendered to him. Whatever it takes, he says he will protect me... but he will never let me in.
