1596788:::::Calling Out:::::In convincing and atmospheric prose, Rae Meadows (one of Poets &amp; Writers? ?Five Debut Writers to Watch? in 2006) takes us into America's heartland, where a transplanted New Yorker finds that trouble can be found anywhere. As Jane transitions from being a successful copywriter with a screenwriter boyfriend to a single, insecure secretary at a Salt Lake City?based escort service, she allows herself to descend into the lonely world of sexual commerce, and discovers ? through her ?bad? behavior ? a new sense of self.
