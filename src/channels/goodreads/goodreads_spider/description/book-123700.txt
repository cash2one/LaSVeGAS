123700:::::Carnivorous Nights: On the Trail of the Tasmanian Tiger:::::Packing an off-kilter sense of humor and keen scientific minds, Margaret Mittelbach and Michael Crewdson, along with renowned artist Alexis Rockman, take off on a postmodern safari. Their mission? Tracking down the elusive Tasmanian tiger. Tragically, this mysterious, striped predator was hunted into extinction in the early part of the twentieth century. Or was it? Journeying first to the Australian mainland and then south to the wild island of Tasmania, these young naturalists brave a series of bizarre misadventures and uproarious wildlife encounters in their obsessive search for the long-lost beast. Filled with Rockman s stunning drawings of flora and fauna originally crafted from river mud, wombat scat, and even the artist s own blood, Carnivorous Nights is a hip and hilarious account of an unhinged safari, as well as a fascinating portrayal of a wildly unique part of the world. Carniverous Nights is: One of the New York Public Library's "25 Books to Remember from 2005" A New York Public Library Books for the Teen Age, 2006 selection
