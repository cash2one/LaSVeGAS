Yet, as Liesl helps shoulder the burden of running her family s inn, her dreams of composition and childish fancies about the Goblin King must be set aside in favor of more practical concerns. But when her sister K the is taken by the goblins, Liesl journeys to their realm to rescue her sister and return her to the world above. The Goblin King agrees to let K the go for a price.

In exchange for her sister s freedom, Liesl offers her hand in marriage to the Goblin King. He accepts. Down in the Underground, Liesl discovers that the Goblin King still inspires her musically, physically, emotionally. Yet even as her talent blossoms, Liesl s life is slowly fading away, the price she paid for becoming the Goblin King s bride. As the two of them grow closer, they must learn just what it is they are each willing to sacrifice: her life, her music, or the end of the world.
