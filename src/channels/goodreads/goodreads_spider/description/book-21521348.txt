21521348:::::Beck:::::Librarian's note: This is an alternate cover edition for ASIN: B00HHBU5JG. ~DEE~ I ve always been good at wearing masks. Not letting anyone see the real me. I m content being the happy-go-lucky best friend. The strong willed boss. The independent woman who doesn t need a man. But the truth is I m just as broken as the rest of you. I m terrified that all it will take is one person to make all my carefully constructed walls crumble into fine dust. So I guard my heart with everything I have. Determined to never let anyone get close enough to hurt me again. All is perfect until HE walks into my life. No he doesn t just walk. He struts his good-looking, sex-oozing self right into my space and demands that I see HIM. Making me want what I know I can t have. So I did the only thing I know how to do. I run. But he just won t let me go. ~BECK~ The second I see her, I know she will be mine. I see past the gorgeous smiles and heart-stopping laughter. I see HER. She doesn t want me to know her secrets or the past that haunts her, but I make it my mission to find out. To make her mine. She can run all she wants, but it will never be far enough to stop me from coming after her. She s it for me and she knows it. She s just too scared to admit it. **NO cliffhanger, HEA, inter-connected standalones**
