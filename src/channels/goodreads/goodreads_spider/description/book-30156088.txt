30156088:::::The Beech Tree:::::The Beech Tree introduces you to the lives of those who visited the tree and shared their lives, their loves, their hopes and dreams, beneath the tree s dark green canopy and their curious, inexplicable connection to one another. The readers are introduced to Johnny and Margo, the first characters to visit the tree, just before Johnny ships off to fight in The Great War in 1918. We follow Johnny and Margo, Johnny's lifelong, albeit socially taboo, friendship with his friend, Bullet Joe Rogan, a pitcher in the Negro Leagues. Johnny introduces his granddaughter, Debby, to the tree in 1957, an era of bobby socks, roller-skating carhops and Elvis music, and Debby meets Mason in 1967's Summer of Love, just before Mason is drafted to fight in Vietnam. For 30 years, Debby wonders whatever became of the boy who changed her life. Then she finds out.
