13646:::::Sixty Odd:::::Here is the first new book of poems in more than a decade from the author so well known for her thought-provoking science fiction novels. It is also the most autobiographical of Ursula K. Le Guin's five poetry collections, taking its inspiration from the wisdom and perspective that a woman attains in her sixties. Here she is at turns wry, playful, and sharply critical, with finely observed details of her day-to-day life and moving philosophical reflections on growing older.
