If the hardships of seeking four magical crystals before they fall into malevolent hands weren t enough, he must also deal with the inner struggles of his heart. Forced by fate to choose between the roles of guardianship or prolong his romantic connection with the woman he loves. Despite warnings from the wizened Mirabel, his father, Darshun leans toward his love life, ignoring the possible threats which might endanger the company of the quest. Furious with Darshun s incompetence, one amongst the company, Nayland, reveals to Darshun why he hates him so passionately, and attempts to kill him. Almost bested by this enraged dark warrior, he s then rescued by his father. Darshun soon realizes things are not always what they appear to be, and begins to take his guardianship role more solemnly. He s compelled to journey to a deadly, mystical island to perfect his skills seven years of training and hardship in another realm. If he endures the hellish rigors of the Island, he will return to his quest after only a day passing in the earthly realm, in hopes it will better prepare him for the darker times to come.
