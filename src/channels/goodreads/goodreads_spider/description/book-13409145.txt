13409145:::::Necromancing the Stone:::::With the defeat of the evil Douglas behind him, Sam LaCroix is getting used to his new life. Okay, so he hadn t exactly planned on being a powerful necromancer with a seat on the local magical council and a capricious werewolf sort-of-girlfriend, but things are going fine, right? Well . . . not really. He s pretty tired of getting beat up by everyone and their mother, for one thing, and he can t help but feel that his new house hates him. His best friend is a werebear, someone is threatening his sister, and while Sam realizes that he himself has a lot of power at his fingertips, he s not exactly sure how to use it. Which, he has to admit, is a bit disconcerting. But when everything starts falling apart, he decides it s time to step up and take control. His attempts to do so just bring up more questions, though, the most important of which is more than a little alarming: Is Douglas really dead?
