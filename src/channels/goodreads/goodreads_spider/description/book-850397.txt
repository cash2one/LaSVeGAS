850397:::::Dude Ranch:::::The founders of The Saddle Club -- Stevie Lake, Carole Hanson, and Lisa Atwood -- gear up for the adventure of their lives when their friend Kate Devine invites them to her family's dude ranch. They will have a whole week of cowboy-style riding, plus the fun of making Kate a club member. But when they arrive, the girls soon realize there's more to the West than Hollywood shootout and colorful costumes. To show a cowhand that they're not just "dumb dudes," they pitch in with chores and help on a cattle roundup, where Stevie has a run-in with a dangerous rattlesnake. Another sour note for Stevie: Her birthday is coming up, and no one seems to care. Little does she know that her Saddle Club buddies have a top-secret surprise in the works for her!
