1367916:::::Lucca:::::On a lovely evening in April, Lucca Montale is rushed to the hospital after the car she was driving collided head-on with a truck. Robert, her doctor, has to break the news that she may never see again. Lucca is an actress with a string of love affairs behind her, now unhappily married with a son. Since his divorce, Robert has lived in a state of emotional paralysis and resignation, relieved only by the weekend visits of his young daughter. During their daily conversations he and Lucca share their life stories, and slowly they are drawn to one another, on terms new to both. The result is a love story of immense emotional reach that will enhance Jens Christian Gr ndahl's reputation as one of the most readable and perceptive novelists writing today.
