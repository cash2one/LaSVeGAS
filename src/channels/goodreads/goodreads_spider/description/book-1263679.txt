1263679:::::A Life Inside: A Prisoner's Notebook:::::In the mid-1980s, Erwin James was sentenced to life imprisonment for double murder.

He tells of arriving in prison; about learning the who, what, why and when of prison life; about bullying and terror from other inmates and security staff; about replaying the crimes of his past over and over; and about discovering his talent for writing. This is a book that takes its readers on Erwin James's moving and terrible journey from vicious youth to reformed and reflective middle age.
