646170:::::Sleeping and Waking:::::Poetry. SLEEPING AND WAKING moves between states of consciousness and the phenomenal world, finding reciprocities among sleep, dreams, weather, and urban signs.

His poems offer what Ezra Pound calls "luminous details" in glimpsed gestures or overheard vernacular, full of the flaneur's alert attention.
