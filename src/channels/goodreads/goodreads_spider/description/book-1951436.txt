1951436:::::Cat of Many Tails:::::The city was in a panic! Like a savage cat, the unknown strangler had pounced on his victims. Victims chosen seemingly at random. One murder after another. The police were completely baffled. The mayor ordered Ellery Queen on the case. There were the facts, laid our as neatly as the corpses. But where did they connect? Ellery believed that these seemingly mad murders were all committed by the same person. But he couldn't prove it. He believed that there was a pattern in the killings that would provide a solution. But he couldn't find it. Ellery was as baffled as the police. They worked desperately. But the murders went on. The cat was still at large!
