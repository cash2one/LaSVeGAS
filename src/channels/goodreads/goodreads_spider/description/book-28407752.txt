28407752:::::Lights of Polaris:::::From the critically acclaimed author of After Forever Ends and Burning Down Rome : Throughout her life, Daisy Cade was a free spirit who tried to fit in, but her struggle to conform was futile. And it was suffocating her. Desperate for air, she would pack up and run, often leaving chaos in her wake. At the age of thirty, weary of being labeled a wild child , she descended into a loveless relationship with a man who targeted her with his insidious mental cruelty - a psychological abuse so overwhelming, it threatened her sanity. On her thirty-fifth birthday, she fled that life, too. She returned home to Chicago, safe in the refuge of her famous brother s house, but reeling from the fallout of her latest breakup. What she didn t expect was for her life to collide with Stuart Adkins, whose piercing blue eyes could see right through her and understand more than she wanted him to know. An enigmatic woman on the edge. A devoted but meddling family. An angry ex, hell-bent on payback - and a handsome Irish singer with a troubled past. Only one thing is certain: Daisy Cade s future is arriving like a train that s jumped the tracks.
