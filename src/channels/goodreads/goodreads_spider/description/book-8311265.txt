8311265:::::Broadway Tails:::::Bill Berloni was a nineteen-year-old theater apprentice when he was offered his big break: the chance to act professionally if he could find and train a dog to appear in the original production of the Broadway hit Annie. Defying the odds, Bill rescued a dog from a local shelter and, together, they redefined what animal performers could do. In Broadway Tails, Bill tells the true stories of throw-away animals who came back to co-star with some of entertainment s biggest names, from Richard Burton to Sarah Jessica Parker. Here you ll meet: The original Sandy, who starred for seven years in Annie St. Vito, the deaf bull terrier, who saved the show Pi, the first dog to dance with the New York City Ballet Chico, the Chihuahua with attitude who became the face of one of Broadway s newest hits Often funny, and always touching, these and other stories demonstrate the extraordinary things rescued animals can do.
