18773475:::::Blood and Water:::::Dora lives by the sea. Dora has always lived by the sea. But she won t go into the water. The last time Dora swam in the sea was the day of her mother s funeral, the day she saw the mermaid. Now she s an adult, a respectable married woman, and her little sister Lucie has come home from university with a horrible secret. Dora s safe and dry life begins to fray, as she is torn between protecting her baby sister and facing up to a truth she has always known but never admitted. And the sea keeps calling her, reminding her of what she saw beneath the waves all those years ago of what will be waiting for her if she dives in again.
