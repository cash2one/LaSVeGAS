12833311:::::Pride and Prejudice:::::It is a truth universally acknowledged that Jane Austen's "Pride and Prejudice" is one of the best-loved novels of all time--and today, it's more popular than ever. When the wealthy and very eligible bachelor Charles Bingley purchases an estate in the Bennets' small town, he and the beautiful Jane immediately fall in love. But Bingley's arrogant friend Darcy just as quickly alienates Lizzy when she overhears him speaking dismissively of her. These first impressions have lasting repercussions for Jane, Elizabeth, and their whole family. Rich in wit and wisdom, humor and humanity, "Pride and Prejudice" takes a probing, entertaining look at the nature of love, money, and power in Georgian England.
