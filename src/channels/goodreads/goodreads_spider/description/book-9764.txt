9764:::::Wild Swan:::::Sweeping from England's West Country during the Napoleonic wars when smuggling flourished, to Maryland's lush horse country-a golden land shadowed by slavery and soon to be ravaged by civil war-this is the story of unforgettable Alexandria Thaine and the generations of two families interwoven by fortune and fate. Across an ocean, through decades of danger and desire, this is Alexandria's life-the life of an indomitable woman who gives her tormented heart to two bold men, who travels to distant America in search of a dream and in flight from a love that would follow her to the end of her days, and who creates a dynasty in the years preceding the Civil War.
