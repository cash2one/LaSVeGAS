3744599:::::The Faerie Door:::::Long ago the Faerie Queen created portals between our world and hers, so that children could summon help from faeries whenever the need arose. But a wicked entity called the Shadow Knight is endeavoring to control the doors between the two worlds, and only evil can get through. It falls to two imaginative eleven-year-olds Victoria Deveny, from 1890 Britain, and Elliot Good, from 1966 America to thwart his plan. The Faerie Queen dispatches the youths on separate quests to retrieve orbs of power that will ultimately defeat the Shadow Knight. Their bravery and friendship are tested as the children travel to fantastic realms and face life-threatening dangers from dragons to flying pirate ships to a wicked sorceress queen before they're reunited to confront the dreaded Shadow Knight.
