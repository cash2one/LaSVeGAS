1605399:::::Stable Groom:::::Stevie, Carole, and Lisa are ecstatic that stable owner Max Regnery III is about to marry. They can't resist being part of things, so they plan a surprise "bridle" shower for the groom-to-be. Some serious business also needs their attention. The girls want stablehand Red to become a certified riding counselor. Maybe that way, he can be in charge of Pine Hollow Stables while Max is honeymooning and he'll get some respect from bossy Veronica diAngelo. It looks as if disaster will strike when both plans are marred by a mix-up that only The Saddle Club could cause!
