18343155:::::Chasing Forever:::::Lucy &amp; Toby's Book I always thought I was going to end up marrying Lucy, the woman I loved with my entire existence. Unfortunately, the woman staring back at me, readying to say our vows wasn t the blue-eyed woman I loved. She was the woman who was chasing after my best friend, but we somehow ended up on the damn altar in a church in Madrid. Lucy gave up on me you see. Love and hate were both shone in her eyes when she pleaded for me to cancel this farcical union. All I needed was for her to say it for her to tell me that she loved me. But what did she do? She walked away for the second time. That truly gutted me. I knew then that she would never choose me, nor would she fight for me or for the love we once so profoundly shared. But seeing her again in Rome months later twisted me inside out, because time didn t make my feelings ebb away. In fact, it was rotting in me, slowly poisoning everything I once cherished, loved and believed. Could I risk myself again? Or should I just let bygones be bygones and walk away just as she had done?
