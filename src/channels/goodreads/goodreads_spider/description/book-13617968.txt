13617968:::::Emma's Secret:::::Librarian's Note: Original cover edition for ASIN# B00BAZ4YBK For two years, Megan, Peter, and their two older daughters, Alexis and Hannah, dream of nothing but being reunited with the family s youngest child, Emma, who was kidnapped just before her third birthday. When Emma is miraculously found living with an elderly couple just miles from the family s home, they are hopeful that her return will heal the wounds her disappearance created. But Emma is vastly different from the sunny toddler they remember. She barely remembers her parents or her older sisters. She is quiet and withdrawn, and, worst of all, longs for the very people who kidnapped her. Megan is consumed with bitterness, while Peter works later and later nights in the company of his gorgeous business partner. And in the middle of everything, Megan s best friend has become suddenly distant and secretive. Then a chance encounter in town leads to a secret that changes everything again for Emma. And Peter must decide between the happiness of his youngest daughter and the trust of his family.
