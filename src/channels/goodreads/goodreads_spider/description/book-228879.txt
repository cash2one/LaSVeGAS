228879:::::Old Turtle:::::Who is God? Is He a wind that is never still? Is He a rock that never moves? Is He high above or here among us? Venerable Old Turtle answers quietly: God is all of these things. Old Turtle first burst upon the publishing scene in 1992, and it was instantly recognized as a classic fable about ecology, peace, and the interconnectedness of all beings. Simple yet profound, it has since brought hope and inspiration to children and adults around the world.
