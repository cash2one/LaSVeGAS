11759990:::::Lunara: Seth and Chloe:::::Unique and distinct in setting and style, Lunara takes the reader on a space adventure set in our solar system. This full length novel (388 print pages) is a mix of action adventure and space opera. Earth is dead, destroyed by a barrage of meteors. What was left of the population has escaped to Mars and colonized it as humanities new home. Lunara, a small colony on Earth s moon, is charged with catching and mining meteors for desperately needed minerals. But the deep-seated human thirst for domination is not easily defeated, nor is the capacity for deceit and betrayal. All it needs is a powerful catalyst, a prize valuable enough to risk plunging mankind into another destructive war. Parker McCloud and his friends, Seth and Chloe, are caught up in a violent series of events when Lunara is invaded. On Mars, Parker, Seth, Chloe, and the crew of the Protector attempt to sort out who is responsible, where the tide of suspicion swings back and forth between Aethpis and Zephyria. In the end, we see barbarism by the leaders of Mars, great courage by the crew of the Protector, and immense valor by the military on Lunara in adventure one in an exciting new series.
