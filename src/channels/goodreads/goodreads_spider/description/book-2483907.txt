But that s ok, with the right ad she ll pull in some girls, their rent and if she s lucky, she won t have to go to work any time soon. For their part, Anna, Lelani, and Megan all have their reasons for wanting to move in: Anna has got to get out from under her overprotective parents; Lelani can t take another day in her aunt s tiny crackerbox house overflowing with toddlers and Megan needs a place free of her current roommate from Hades. Though they come with assorted extra baggage filled with broken hearts and dreams, they will discover they also have a vast array of hidden strengths. As they struggle to become the women they want to be, they ll find new hope and maybe even Kendall will learn a thing or two about life, love and the true meaning of friendship.
