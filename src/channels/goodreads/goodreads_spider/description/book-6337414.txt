6337414:::::American: The Bill Hicks Story:::::Bill Hicks is considered by many the greatest American comedian of the last 20 years, an ironic honour given his relative anonymity in his native country. His short, intense career encompassed battling drink and drugs, censorship of his material, the pressures of international fame and, on the verge of conquering the States, his diagnosis with cancer at the age of 32. His fierce independent spirit and relentless pursuit of truth and higher understanding made him a comic ahead of his time, and he blazed a path for countless young comedians afterwards. American: The Bill Hicks Story provides the most in-depth and personal account of his amazing life and career ever published. Based on in-depth interviews with Hicks's family and closest friends, and including rare and intimate photos that cover his entire career, it is the definitive oral and visual history of this legendary outlaw comic.
