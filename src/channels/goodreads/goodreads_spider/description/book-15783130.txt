15783130:::::Prophecies Awakening:::::When her sorceress mother and vampire king father are brutally murdered, Kassina makes a pact with Shindar, the Demon of Darkness. In exchange for her soul, Kassina obtains power to become the most feared sorceress in all the lands; she could make the people pay dearly for the deaths of her parents. Granted eternal life, Kassina and her evil are never far away. For years, Marithia, a mystical world inhabited by humans and elves, has lived in an age of peace. But that peace is shattered when King Arman is slain by his own son, a pawn of the vampire sorceress Kassina. Arman's murder sparks the most brutal and bloody war ever seen between the Forces of Darkness and the peaceful Marithians. Vartan, a young knight who was wrongfully banished from King Arman's court, reluctantly discovers he is the subject of a prophecy to activate the legendary weapon, Talonsphere. He forms an alliance with the mythical dragons and has the opportunity to rid the world of the oppressors forever and experience eternal peace.
