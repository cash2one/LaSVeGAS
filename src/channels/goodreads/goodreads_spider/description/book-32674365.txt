32674365:::::Sweet Girl:::::Kylah I ve always lived in the shadows of my athletic older brother and my charismatic twin sister. And that s okay by me. I don t mind being known as the shy wallflower. The gawky geek. The sweet, virginal girl. Well, that s one label I ve been trying to rid myself of since starting my freshman year in college this year. The thing is, no one s ever looked twice at me. Until I met Van Gerard. He notices me. He looks at me and seems to like what he sees. He understands and listens to me. He s become a great friend. The problem is, I don t want him as a friend. I want more. But my brother - along with a state line between us, and oh yeah, Van s long-time girlfriend - are just a few complications getting in the way of what I want. Van I thought my senior year in college would be the best time of my life. I m a starter on a Pac-12 basketball team, set to graduate with a degree in Finance. I have a girlfriend whom I d planned to start a future with. I thought my life was already mapped out. But then the bottom dropped out with a confession I never expected to hear, from the girl I thought I knew. I thought wrong. Luckily for me, Kylah Griffin was there to break my fall. She s the best thing this year has given me. She s helped me through a devastating blow that could have sent me reeling. I know she wants more, but I m not sure I can give it. Now that I ve been burned, I don t think I can go there again. Kylah s not a hook-up, and she s definitely not a rebound. She s a sweet girl who deserves more than to be friend-zoned. If only things weren t so complicated.
