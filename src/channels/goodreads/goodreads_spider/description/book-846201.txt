At thirty-seven, Christine Moore had a world-class case of burnout: career blues, no husband, no children, an imperfect figure, and dimming expectations. "I'm going to show you a peace so beautiful, you'll probably forget what your life has been like up until now," he said. Who was this guy? "My friends call me Joe. Others call me 'God' or 'Higher Power.' You can call me whatever you're most comfortable with." Right. But he knows everything about her, every one of her heart's desires. A sweet serenity settles over Christine. And so the journey begins, a triumphant odyssey of self-discovery that illuminates our souls. As we join one woman's inspiring quest for healing and life-changing truths, we discover six powerful precepts that offer the deepest peace and fulfillment we can ever know.
