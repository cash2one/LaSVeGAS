23247796:::::Revenge:::::Two MCs and one enemy who will come out alive? Any threat against The Skulls and Tiny deals with it, but Gonzalez is not any ordinary threat. Taking him out will require more than a bullet to the head. It s going to take time, patience, and help, but can Tiny trust Devil? No one s been able to control the leader of Chaos Bleeds, so how far does Devil s loyalty go? When Eva and Angel are attacked, Tiny loses it. He ll handle the threat alone and a friendship is torn apart. Called away from Fort Wills, Devil has no choice but to deal with the dead body hung up outside of his compound. Lexie s sister wasn t part of his world, but now he has to deal with her death. He s done with the threats, the deaths, and the uncertainty and with Tiny. Devil s going to take out the fucker that has almost destroyed his club, no matter who stands in his way. No one is going to be the same again as Gonzalez leaves his mark wherever he goes. Who will survive? Who will die? And what will happen next?
