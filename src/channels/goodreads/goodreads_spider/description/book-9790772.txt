And she thinks her house in the hills is haunted. It doesn't help that her husband Truman spelunks and climbs, making her worry more with each adventure he takes. As the two grow apart, Nicole makes decisions that may ultimately shatter her fragile marriage. Her life changes on the afternoon she receives a phone call from the harbor. During a scuba dive, Truman disappears. No one not his diving instructor, not the Coast Guard can find him. Is he still alive? Or is grief making her believe the impossible?
