6080938:::::Stories from the Life of Joseph Smith:::::This children s chapter book, specifically created for children ages 8 12 to be able to read on their own, is also a great story to read with them at bedtime or anytime! Meticulously researched for accuracy s sake, this book will help young people gain a testimony of the mission of Joseph Smith. Line drawings throughout help bring his story to life for them. Each chapter of the book presents one incident from Joseph Smith s life and can be read as an individual story. But the stories are arranged chronologically so that, as a whole, they present a full biography of Joseph Smith for the young reader. As one parent stated: I read this book aloud at bedtime to my four little boys, ten to three. I ll cherish the conversation we had after the last page was read where we all agreed that we knew Joseph s mission was God- led and that he was a prophet. Thank you for this book!
