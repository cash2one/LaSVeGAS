1104664:::::Our Riches in Christ: Discovering the Believer's Inheritance in Ephesians:::::Stedman draws from the entire book of Ephesians the encouragement that comes from reviewing the resources and riches of a life with Christ, and the facts that undergird the Christian faith. 'Our Riches in Christ' helps Christians understand the liberating, transforming truths that produce lasting joy, unbounded peace, and radiant faith. Throughout his thorough, verse-by-verse analysis of Paul's letter to the Ephesians, master teacher Ray Stedman stops often to show what the Scriptures mean for today's believer. Practical issues of husband and wife relationships and church order find their way alongside such vital theological issues as faith, prayer, and spiritual warfare.
