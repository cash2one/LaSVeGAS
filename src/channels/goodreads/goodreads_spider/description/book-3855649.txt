3855649:::::Grace Works:::::Ever since Adam and Eve were escorted out of the garden, mankind has sought a way to regain God's acceptance-often through outward religion. But religion alone will never satisfy the human need for God's acceptance. Only by drinking deeply of grace can we find life that is simple, meaningful, and satisfying-a life in which we can find rest and cease our constant striving to be accepted, affirmed, and appreciated. Dudley Hall, author and president of Successful Christian Living Ministries, points the way to meaningful existence in this new release of his powerful Grace Works.
