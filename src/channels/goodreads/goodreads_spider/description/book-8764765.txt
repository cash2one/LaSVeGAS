Now, thanks to a special team of archaeologists and mind-blowing new technology, Cross is on the verge of a world-changing discovery that will either set humanity ablaze for Christ or accelerate the powers of darkness to destroy mankind. As a holy war heats up in the Holy Land, Cross and his team race to realize their discovery. Will Cross find the proof he seeks? Or, will the demonic forces of evil descend on his team and erase the hope of mankind forever? Author, Steven G.
