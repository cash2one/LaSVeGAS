5711749:::::Peace, Love, and Baby Ducks:::::Wealth, privilege, and way too many pastel-tinted opinions...that's Carly's life. And guess what? It's. Getting. On. Her. Nerves. Carly wants to be real , and she's always counted on her little sister, Anna, to love her and support her and tell her how right she is.

And of course there are boys involved, complicating things as boys always do.
