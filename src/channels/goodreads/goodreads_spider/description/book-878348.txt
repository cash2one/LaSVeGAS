878348:::::Winners & Losers:::::Tonypandy in 1910 is a town of poverty, hardship, and strife, garrisoned by troops brought in to control the striking miners whose anger all too frequently erupts into bouts of violence and rioting. Megan Williams is 18 and in love with the boy next door, Victor Evans. But Megan's father would rather see his daughter dead than married to a Catholic, particularly one whose father and brother are marked as strike ringleaders. Tempers and violence flare on both sides of the dispute. Caught in the middle, Victor and Megan find themselves fighting for the right to love one another, remain together and build a future they can share.
