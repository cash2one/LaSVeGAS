7788360:::::Before I Fall:::::They say live every day as if it s your last but you never actually think it's going to be. At least I didn't. The thing is, you don t get to know when it happens. You don t remember to tell your family that you love them or in my case remember to say goodbye to them at all. But what if, like me, you could live your last day over and over again? Could you make it perfect? If your whole life flashed before your eyes, would you have no regrets? Or are there some things you d want to change...?
