15762662:::::Tall, Dark and Divine:::::Annie Landon has given up on finding Mr. Right, and has gone out looking for Mr. Tonight instead. A conversation overheard in the bathroom of Dionysus s Bar about a jilted and lonely "Greek god" in need of a quick pick-me-up sounds like just what she s looking for. But picking up the god of love for a one-night stand is easier said than done--especially when he's sworn off mortals forever. Eros has been down and out since his ex-wife left him, and falling for another mortal woman is the last thing he needs. Which means a maddening desire for the woman across the street is not in the cards. Thus begins his quest to find a match made in heaven for Annie. It's the perfect plan ... if only Eros can bear to let the girl of his dreams go. Can a woman looking for love, and a matchmaking god who wants her to find it with someone else have a shot at a happy ending, or will Eros's golden arrows miss their mark, for once?
