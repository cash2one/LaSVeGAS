65716:::::Complete Poems:::::Karin Boye (1900-41) was one of Sweden's greatest poets. She rose above shattering personal defeats to write with honesty, clarity of vision and nobility of utterance. Her poetry reflects - with naked candour - the harsh realities of her tragic inner struggle, which was eventually to lead to her suicide in 1941.
