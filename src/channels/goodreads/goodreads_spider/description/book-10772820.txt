10772820:::::The Last Chapter:::::The Last Chapter is set in the Torahus sanatorium, where the sufferings of most of the patients are related to civilisation. The novel has a group of central characters, but no distinct main character. Among the characters is "The Suicide", who entered the sanatorium following the discovery of his wife s infidelity and threatens constantly to take his own life. Another guest is the lovely Julie d'Espard. She enters into a relationship with the bogus Count Flemming and gets pregnant. When Flemming disappears one day she turns to Daniel Utby, who runs a small farm near Torahus and who represents the novel s ideological norm. The Last Chapter is one of Hamsun s darkest novels. It was written at a time when he was much preoccupied by death. The novel is often compared with Thomas Mann s The Magic Mountain, which was published the year after.
