8050160:::::Bitin' Back:::::Mavis Dooley, mother of twenty year-old Nevil (or 'The Nev' as he's affectionately known), is appalled and confused when her only son awakes and informs her that he's white and a woman. Not just any women but the late twentieth century novelist Jean Rhys! Soon Nevil takes to wearing his mother's frocks and 'eyeshada'. Mavis wonders if her son is gay. She sets out to find an answer to Nev's crazy behaviour. Amidst all the lies and cover-ups, Mavis must use all her cunning abilities to keep the truth about Nev hidden. But soon the townspeople start to suspect something amiss. Fearing the town's vicious retribution, should they uncover Nev's secret, Mavis enlists the help of her brother, Booty Dooley, bare-knuckle brawler, pig shooter, man's man. Booty takes one look at his nephew and asserts that he'll soon make a man out of him. Booty embarks on a pig-shooting trip,and a bare-knuckle box-up, figuring this will instill 'manliness' in his wayward nephew. However, Nevil has other ideas.
