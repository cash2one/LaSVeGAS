16095661:::::Repercussions:::::A Story of Drama, Deception and Duplicity. Set in France, this latest book by Glyn Smith-Wild continues to follow the life of Ben Coverdale as he tries to settle down to a comfortable life with his beloved, Mary. However, the past is never far behind and the danger posed by an angry ex' continues to put both Ben and Mary in consistent peril. What sets this apart from other books of a similar genre is the exacting details as offered by the author and the subsequent way in which the reader is thoroughly engaged in the escapades of this threesome. Ben is clearly not only protector to Mary, but also has a vested interest in digging deep to the bottom of what motivates Donald. His rival is interested in Mary not just for pure and romantic reasons, but she is integral to a larger plot that Donald has hatched via his diamond dealings. In fact, Donald is confident that Mary knows a bit too much about his illicit transactions and thus she must be dealt with appropriately.
