9487892:::::Dismember:::::The summer he turned seven, Dave Abbott survived a gruesome mountainside car accident that left the rest of his family savaged and dead. Now, after living twenty-three years with the twisted backwoodsman who pulled him from the wreckage, Dave is carrying out a plan to replace each of his lost loved ones with members of nearby, unsuspecting families. He has prepared, he's stalked, and now his chance has come to get his family safely out of the mountains once and for all. Whether they like it or not.
