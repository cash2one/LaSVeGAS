95531:::::Superstud: Or How I Became a 24-Year-Old Virgin:::::Lost in love and don't know much? Paul Feig knew even less... Like any other red-blooded, straight young man, Paul Feig spent much of his teenage years trying to solve the mystery of women. Unlike most red-blooded, straight teenage boys, however, Paul Feig was sadly at a considerable disadvantage. He was tall and gangly. He had a love for musical theater. And, perhaps the death knell for his burgeoning sex life, Paul was a tap dance student. (And we have the pictures to prove it see the front cover.) Infused with the same witty and infectiously readable style of his first book, Kick Me , Superstud chronicles the trials and tribulations of Feig s young dating life with all the same excruciating detail as an on-air gastric bypass and you just won t be able to tear yourself away. Feig s series of shudder-to-think but oddly familiar (come on we ve all been dumped by someone we didn t even like that much) anecdotes include: his first date, at an REO Speedwagon concert with the most endowed girl in school, who leaves him sitting next to a puddle of puke; his first breakup, accomplished by moving across the country; his mortifying date with his secretly bigoted girlfriend; his discovery of a new self-love technique that almost lands him in the hospital; and his less-than-idealistic first time, which he nevertheless elevates to biblical proportions. In Superstud , Paul Feig tells all in a hilarious but true testament to geekdom, love, and growing up.
