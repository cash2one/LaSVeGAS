10207851:::::Pride and Prejudice II: The Sequel:::::This sequel starts where Pride and Prejudice left off. From the marriage of Darcy and Elizabeth, the story relates the everyday life of the late 18th Century Pemberley Estate and the lives of the people associated with that great estate. We learn of Darcy's Christian name in very exciting circumstances. The ups and downs, the joys and woes of the characters will bring laughter and tears to many readers. The ending is exceptional and quite unorthodox. However, the sequel will in due course have a sequel, Pride and Prejudice III that will make a story of equally compulsive reading.
