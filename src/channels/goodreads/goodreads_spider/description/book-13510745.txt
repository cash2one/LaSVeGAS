13510745:::::Sebastian Cupid:::::If you ve never shot yourself in the chest, Sebastian Cupid can tell you it hurts like hell. Still, he d rather take three bullets to any part of his anatomy than find his brother s body in an alley, drained of blood. Now Sebastian is facing an inquiry from three gods while an innocent mortal lies comatose in a bed just down the hall, and she s the only eye witness. Armed with next to no information and a lifelong history of resentment, Sebastian s only pool for suspects is his step-family, who uses questionable methods to spread hate in the mortal world. But then disappearances begin to happen on both sides of the family. As gods clash and Temples fall, they pit power against power to survive. Little do they realize, the only one that can save them is the least powerful of them all.
