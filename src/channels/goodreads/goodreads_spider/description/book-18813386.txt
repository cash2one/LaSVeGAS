18813386:::::The Dancing Soul of Fire:::::Nine hundred years since the war that gave birth to the Angels and their might is still unrivalled. Ruling a vast country with the iron grip of religion and the steel persuasion of swords they are of unquestionable power. But within the borders of the Cruciform Realm a group of freedom fighters form under the long absent and near mythical Soulborn; Kaszak, meanwhile outside the borders of the Realm other, more sinister, foes begin to wake. The Renders, long crippled from their defeat at the hands of the Angels, stir once again in the frozen north, undying and able to steal the life from their foes their patience is matched only by their ruthlessness. Creatures of fire and creatures of shadow, the long warring Drakes and Vash near now turn their eyes from one another and towards the Realm of the Angels. In his distant fortress the Necromaster defiles the mass graves of the war fought almost a thousand years ago and restores the fallen warriors to fight again in his quest for vengeance. Most dangerous of all though is the human who has stumbled on the lost knowledge. For half his life Marneth has manipulated countries and wars in a ceaseless effort to free humanity, and destroy the Elder Races in the process. Conflicting loyalties and ideals clash as nations and races fight for what they believe to be right; and there is no greater motivation to cruelty than benevolence.
