21394373:::::The 'Wahhabi Myth': Dispelling Prevalent Fallacies and the Fictitious link with Bin Laden:::::The 'Wahhabi' Myth by Haneef James Oliver clarifies many of the gross inaccuracies and outright lies that have been attributed to the belief of the Salafi Muslims (often referred to as "Wahhabis"). Although some reporters have been vigilant enough to rebut some of these widespread fables, most have fallen headfirst into what one discerning reporter called, "the neo-conservative line that the whole conspiracy against America can be traced back to Wahhabism and the government of Saudi Arabia." Oliver outlines the principles of the Salafi creed in an easy to understand manner. Using many different sources, he carefully presents the arguments of the critics of Salafism and successfully addresses the misconceptions contained within these criticisms. Specifically, he addresses the commonly-held belief that Osama Bin Laden is a Salafi/'Wahhabi.' He compellingly dispels this myth and unveils the sect that has provoked Bin Laden to become the leader of a terrorist movement, something that the media has failed to do. Accordingly, it is expected that the "Wahhabi Myth could have a profound effect upon people's understanding of current affairs. This is the book that renowned major media outlets have been anticipating since September 11 as the long awaited reply of the Salafi Muslims.
