17905433:::::Interim Goddess of Love:::::When you're offered to become the goddess of love, how can you refuse? When Hannah is asked to take the place of the goddess of love, she agrees because it was assigned to her by the love of her life-who just so happens to be the very gorgeous sun god. Though she does have a knack for listening to other people's heartaches, she's totally new at it and can't understand how she can help bring love into people's lives when she can't even get one particular boy to pay attention to her. Will Hannah ever survive this goddess gig? Or will she end up heartbroken as well?
