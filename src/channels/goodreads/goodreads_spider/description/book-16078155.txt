16078155:::::AfterTastes and Tales from Russia:::::"I am a Russian-born American citizen and Jewish. I have been raised during the oppressive Soviet regime and fortunate enough to leave it behind. This political memoir is my contribution to show people the contrast between what I have experienced and what we are experiencing in the United States currently. AfterTastes and Tales from Russia (Forgive me for being anti Social...ism) is part memoirs, part political analysis and opinions. The point I try to make is simple, that socialism has never worked and I provide my childhood memories, experiences and analysis on why. AfterTastes and Tales from Russia is a book that will reach out to the people of all political spectrum and race. I provide examples on how the non-religious, atheist society may still be very prejudiced and, in fact, more prejudiced than a free society. I want to help save this nation, so my book is as much from the heart as it is from my knowledge."
