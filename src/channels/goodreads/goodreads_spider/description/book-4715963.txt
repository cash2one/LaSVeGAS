4715963:::::Lost Star:::::Prequel to Victorious Star Series: Interstellar Service &amp; Discipline . Series Note: Although set in the same futuristic world, all of the stories in the Interstellar Service &amp; Discipline series may be read as standalone books. Once upon a time, before the Victorious Star, there were a prince and a prisoner... Aubrey was a tech engineer with a dirty little secret that the Moribund Company was willing to destroy everyone and everything to get their hands on. When Deshryt Seht, blood prince of Skeldhor, saved the dying boy's life, it set off a contest of wills as strong as the call of their blood. Unfortunately Aubrey has one more secret that severs their relationship before it can truly begin. Though years and an ocean of stars separate the prince from the prisoner he saved, neither the prince nor the Moribund Company will let him escape. What was Lost will be found, winner take all.
