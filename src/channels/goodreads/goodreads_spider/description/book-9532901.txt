Hot-as-hell, tough-as-nails detective Ivy Tamwood has been demoted from homicide down to lowly street-crime detail. As if rousting trolls and policing pixies instead of catching killers wasn t bad enough, she s also been saddled with a newbie partner who s an earth witch. It s enough to make any living vampire bare her fangs. But when a coven of murderous witches begins preying on werewolves, Rachel Morgan quickly proves she s a good witch who knows how to be a badass. Together, Ivy and Rachel hit the mean streets to deal swift justice to the evil element among Cincinnati s supernatural set.
