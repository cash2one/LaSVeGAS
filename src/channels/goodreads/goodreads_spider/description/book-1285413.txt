1285413:::::Arthur and the Minimoys:::::Deep underground, the Minimoys are waiting . . . for a champion. Arthur's grandfather disappeared four years ago. All he left behind are his notebooks full of stories about the Minimoys, a miniature people who are all less than one inch tall! But the Minimoys can't possibly be real . . . can they? Ten-year-old Arthur is about to find out, as a hidden message catapults him on an adventure wilder than he had ever imagined. He'll face mosquito-riding soldiers, a malevolent wizard, giant centipedes, and one very independent princess . . . and along the way he might discover that the littlest heroes can make the biggest difference.
