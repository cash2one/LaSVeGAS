21504426:::::Writing Short Stories to Promote Your Novels:::::A short story is the perfect tool for promoting your novel. Readers who love your story will look for more fiction by the same author. Here are some ideas: post a story on your website as a free read or give it to another writer of the same genre to display it on their website. Publish it as a short free ebook, bolstering your list of published books. Offer it as a giveaway on blog tours. Submit it to a magazine, ezine or anthology where it will get read by lovers of your genre. This book is structured like a workshop, based on an online class I taught. As you progress through the chapters, you ll build your story step by step, from the spark of an idea to the polished version that will wow your readers and make them eager to buy your novel. For powerful promotion, writing a great story is not enough. It needs to be a particular kind of story to target your audience, win fans and sell books. To get the most from this book, you should have at least one novel to promote, whether traditionally or indie-published. You need to have mastered the basics of the fiction writer s craft, though not necessarily of the short story form. If you re a fiction writing novice or are still working on your first novel, it s too soon to follow this programme, although you may find useful inspiration. If you enjoy writing, and if you have a novel you want to promote, you ve come to the right place.
