12362559:::::The Quiet:::::The Yukon is a captivating place for those who care to reach deep to probe the secrets she holds tightly to herself. It is not a land for the fainthearted. If you choose to you can close the door on your past and live according to the elements you are surrounded by. Fear has claimed many lives in the backcountry I have written about. I have shared some of my fears when I often found myself completely isolated with my closest friend Tannis, a rescue dog, who understood the true meaning of pain, suffering and rejection. I will take you, the reader, through a process of 12 years of personal healing. God brought many people into my life, which, unbeknownst to me, had an impact upon His intervention and the love He has for me. As I have written this series God has reminded me of the power of sharing our faith with the lost and the impact it can and will have on their lives. As you read, I encourage you to hear what the Father wants you to hear as He has spoken it to me. Be blessed on your adventure with Tannis and me. Rolly A. Chabot
