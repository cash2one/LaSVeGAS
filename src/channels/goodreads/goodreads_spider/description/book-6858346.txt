6858346:::::Small Trades:::::Photographer Irving Penn is renowned for his innovative contributions to portrait, still life, and fashion photography, and a career that spanned more than six decades at Vogue magazine. In 1950, Vogue assigned Penn to photograph workers in Paris, and thus his monumental work Small Trades began. Created in 1950 and 1951 in Paris, London and New York, Small Trades consists of portraits of skilled tradespeople dressed in their work clothes and carrying the tools of their respective trades. Capturing the humble coal heaver and the crisply dressed waiter with equal directness, Penn s arresting portraits also underscore fascinating cultural differences. Small Trades was Penn s most extensive body of work to which he returned over many decades producing ever more exacting prints. Two hundred-six unique images from the series are flawlessly reproduced in this book. In addition, the introductory essay describes the history and context of the Small Trades series and its importance to Penn s career and the history of photography. An interview with Edmonde Charles-Roux, the chief editor for French Vogue from 1952 to 1966, who assisted Penn on the assignment in Paris, provides fascinating insights of the Paris sittings.
