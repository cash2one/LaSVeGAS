891586:::::The Heavenly Horse from the Outermost West:::::The Heavenly Horse is the Dancer, a shining Appaloosa stallion, first of all horses in the Army of One Hundred and Five and guardian of the Courts of the Outermost West. Anor the Executioner, monstrous and fanged, is the servant of the Dark Horse. He comes from the Gates of Death and if he can, he will destroy the Dancer. Between them stands Duchess, last true mare of the Appaloosa line. With the Dancer, she runs away from the barns of men but is stalked by Anor and his Harrier Hounds. If they can kill her and her foal, the Appaloosa breed will be ended.
