1121717:::::Devil's Footsteps:::::Bryan was 10 when his brother, Adam, just . . . disappeared. That was five years ago, and now Bryan is the only one who seems to remember what happened. Until he meets two others with their own unsolved mysteries. It seems that Adam isn t the first to disappear. Someone or something is after the kids in their neighborhood. The adults can t hear it, and they can t see it or feel it but the kids can. And it all comes back to the skipping rhyme that every child in town knows by heart . . . and the Dark Man who haunts everyone s worst nightmares while they re awake.
