7229765:::::Numerology:::::Ed Peterson has written the definitive numerology book. First he walks you step by step through how to do the math, and then he describes each of the numbers 0 through 100 in detail and gives over 100 pages of examples as well. Nothing esoteric here. Only concrete, tangible, practical, real world numerology. Numerology for you and your life. Or, if you prefer, a sort of spiritual Sudoku. Since the numbers 1 through 78 each correspond to one of the 78 tarot cards, this book is an invaluable reference for tarot card interpretations. Updated and revised December 2nd, 2011.
