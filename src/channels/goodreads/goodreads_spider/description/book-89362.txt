89362:::::Summer Breeze:::::The year is 1889, and Rachel Hollister hasn't set foot outside her house in five years. Ever since a savage attack left her family dead, she's cordoned herself off from the outside world, afraid to let anyone into her home or into her heart. But now trouble has appeared on her doorstep and suddenly she has no choice but to let a handsome rancher invade her well-guarded existence ... Confirmed bachelor Joseph Paxton grudgingly offers to take up temporary residence at the Hollister ranch even though it's obvious Rachel doesn't want his protection. But once he catches a glimpse of his beautiful young ward and her remarkable spirit, he'll do anything to break through the dark spell that's walled off her heart. It may take a miracle, but he's determined to make her see the refuge he's offering in his embrace and the splendor that exists beyond her front door. Otherwise he'll just have to build a safe haven big enough for the both of them ...
