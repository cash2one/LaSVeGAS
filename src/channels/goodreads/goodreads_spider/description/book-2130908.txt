2130908:::::Red Wine For Breakfast:::::Red Wine For Breakfast stars Jenny Reed, a 34-year-old ex-New Yorker, who plays California Macho Monopoly by her own rules; winner take all. And she had it all, the number one morning radio show on KKTM-FM in Los Angeles, a wonderful best friend, and a nice noncommittal affair with the station owner, Brian Allen. Her career was all she needed. Success was all she ever wanted, until Johnny King became her on-air partner and challenged her to play his own game. The day she beat him was the day she gained his respect. It was also the day she lost her best friend in an apparent suicide ... or was it murder? Real life radio personalities and an actual drug scandal bring realism to a fictional behind-the-scenes expose of Los Angeles radio where formats are changed like dirty socks, and jobs are as secure as houses built on the San Andreas Fault. In a business drowning in testosterone, Red Wine for Breakfast is the story of strong, determined New Yorker who has to shake off the laid-back attitude of L.A. to overcome the challenges of an industry that threatens to turn her off. And a man who only wants to turn her on.
