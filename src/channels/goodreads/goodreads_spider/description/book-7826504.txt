7826504:::::Gallagher Girls Boxed Set:::::Covert Operations 101 Most people know the Gallagher Academy for Exceptional Young Women as a school for the elite--manicured lawns, limo-lined driveway, and the best faculty in the country. But they have no idea what really goes on behind the ivy, or what the brochures mean by "exceptional"--that the Gallagher Academy is actually a highly classified school for spies. The Gallagher Girls may be prodigies in espionage, but there are some mysteries even a genius I.Q. and serious combat skills can't help solve--like how to keep your heart undercover.... Join CIA legacy Cammie Morgan and her fellow spies-in-training as they take their covert talents from the classroom to the field.
