1996765:::::Cystic Fibrosis: The Ultimate Teen Guide:::::Cystic Fibrosis: The Ultimate Teen Guide leaves no aspect of this disease untold. Based on a series of interviews with young people with CF and their family members, the day-to-day dealings of life as a cystic fibrosis patient are described. Some of the topics covered include a description of the illness; a comprehensive discussion of who gets the disease and why; an explanation of the procedures involved in diagnosing CF; coverage of the arduous daily therapies involved in maintaining the life of a person with CF; and the challenges of dealing with CF-related diabetes. These teens' stories reflect how they live their lives to the fullest, how they are not bitter about their situations, and how they look forward to new medications, more-effective therapies, and one day soon a cure. Also included are stories told by people, now in their 30s and 40s, having CF who are still alive and coping well with the disease, demonstrating that progress is being made and that they can hope to live beyond their teen years, something that wasn't likely 20 years ago. This book is the ideal guide for any reader who wants positive medical information about CF, offering an extensive glossary and listings of books, websites, and organizations about Cystic Fibrosis."
