743484:::::Light a Single Candle:::::When Cathy lost her sight at the age of 14, she faced a very different way of life, where her other senses had to take over the work of her eyes. Adjusting to blindness was often easier than handling the reactions of people. One friend who now avoided her her. Another smothered her with too much kindness. Then came the thrill of independence after completing a tough training course with Trudy, her wonderful new guide dog. With her new freedom of movement, Cathy accepted the challenge of going back to public high school. "This book was written by an author who is herself blind, the narrative has the ring of authenticity and is moving without being sentimental or romanticized..."- A.L.A. Booklist
