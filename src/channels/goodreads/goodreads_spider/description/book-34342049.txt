34342049:::::The Year I Turned 25: A Memoir About Sex, Anxiety and a Dog Named She-Devil:::::"I always thought twenty-five was the year I d finally be grown up, the year the world would finally start taking me seriously, the year I would finally know what I wanted. And yet The Year I Turned 25 catalogues the ups and downs of a TV reporter in her mid-twenties, who takes on the added challenge of training an adorable, but misbehaving puppy. Sometimes melancholic and other times hilarious, this brave and thought-provoking memoir approaches dating, sexual assault and mental health in a personal, but relatable way. This book is for every woman who ever asked herself if something was wrong with her and for every dog lover who discovered true love in a puppy. This project isn't about and was never about figuring out who I am. It s about figuring out how to figure out who I am."
