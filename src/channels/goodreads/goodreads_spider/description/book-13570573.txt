13570573:::::Fire:::::Beautiful and brave, seventeen-year-old Fire is the only remaining human "monster" in the Dells. Her hair is the color of flame and she has a wild, irresistible appearance. She guards her power, the power to control minds, unwilling to steal the terrible secrets of innocent people, because she has so many of her own secrets that she can't afford to give away. When Prince Brigan arrives to take her to King City, Fire realizes there's more to her power than she ever dreamed. Her power could save the kingdom. If only she weren't afraid of becoming the monster her father was.
