13138028:::::The 13th Apostle:::::Father Joseph is a devout priest with a sad but inspirational backstory living in Rome when he stumbles upon a well guarded ancient scroll shrouded in secrecy at the Vatican. It was written, he learns, over two thousand years ago by a man believed by a select few to have been a mysterious thirteenth apostle of Christ. When the disturbing prophecies of the scroll are revealed to Father Joseph he is certain the end of days for man is here and he is compelled to embark upon a journey around the world on a quest to save the soul of mankind. He is unaware that Glenn, an angel from the highest order of heaven, has already descended to earth to determine whether man has finally and completely emptied his soul of purity of heart of his own free will. If so, man's demise is imminent. Glenn's work is interrupted when the underworld sends Falene to place a well thought out, diabolical wager with the angel; find the last soul on earth with the purest of heart then turn him or her over to her to be tested. In no other way could the true resolve of mankind be measured. Glenn accepts the bet. If he loses, then all of humanity will be turned over to hell, the abode of the devils where the wicked dwell. When the chosen one is selected as the ultimate representative for all and stripped to his or her core and put to tests a hero would beg to be spared, can he or she rise up against evil in it's most intimidating form to prove that goodness still exists within the heart of mankind? The 13th Apostle begs readers to consider whether mankind is inherently good or evil and where they fall along that often very fine line. The 13th Apostle is the first installment of a trilogy series. Divine Providence, the sequel to The 13th Apostle is an intense and powerful continuation of this story, and is also available on Amazon.com
