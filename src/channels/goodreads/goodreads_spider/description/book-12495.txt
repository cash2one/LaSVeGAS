12495:::::You Don't Know Jack:::::When it comes to sizzling hot romance coupled with outrageous hilarity, nobody delivers like Erin McCarthy. Now she's back with a delicious story where nothing's on the level, everybody's got something to hide, and the only thing honest is the slow, hard pull of irresistible attraction... Love. Sex. Destiny. And A Six-Foot-Four Psychic In A Bridesmaid s Dress? Honey, You Don t Know Jack... Jamie Peters no longer believes in true love. True idiots, true scumbags, true moochers - these she believes in wholeheartedly, and she s got the checkered dating history to prove it. So she s more than a little skeptical when her cross-dressing psychic tells her she s about to meet her soul mate - during an accident. Yeah, sounds about right. And then it happens. A knight in shining armor steps between her and a mugger on a subway platform. Just a regular, honest, upright Jack. The kind they don t make anymore... Jonathon Davidson doesn't believe in destiny - or lying to beautiful women as a rule. But now that Jamie thinks he s just an ordinary guy, how can he possibly tell her that he s really, (A) her roommate s brother, (B) a millionaire to boot, and (C) the jerk who s investigating her application to his grandfather s charitable trust because she may be involved in something illegal? Yeah, rhetorical question. He can t. Not until he knows what s going on. Besides, it would require being able to resist Jamie s luscious curves long enough to say, Hi, my name is Big Liar. Let s get naked. Sometimes, destiny sucks... Somewhere between truth and flat-out-let s-talk-about-this-waaay-later fiction, between fate and delicious accidental insanity, lies a whole lot of mind-blowing sex, delirious passion, unfortunate sundresses, fighting, deception, big mistakes and small hopes, and two people are about to discover that everything happens for a reason...
