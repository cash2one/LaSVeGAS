22561642:::::I'm Not Over You!:::::Imagine a 16 year old cute as well as beautiful chick who tops in class and guys just can't keep their eyes off her. The thing is that now she wants to get into a good medical institution and she knows that being in a relationship will offer nothing but a distraction. She doesn't wanna get involved in anything except her studies and wants to be 'the good girl' that her parents always wished for. Now imagine a 17 year old handsome guy who is known as the 'Lady Killer' of the High School. He has never been into a relationship and is known for rejecting girls. He is on the school football team, in the school rock band, topped the previous class, and is good at computers(but not a nerd). One day(which happens to be 31st December) these two bump into each other trying to bunk high-school for some hangout and a series of complications follow. The girl believes that boys are nothing more than a**holes while the guy thinks that girls are heart-breakers. As soon as their friendship starts to blossom, their friends start hating one another. Will their friendship survive? Will they ever be more than friends? Is their meeting destiny or a mere coincidence? Find out in I'M Not Over You!
