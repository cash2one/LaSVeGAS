21798732:::::Poison's Kiss:::::Alyssa has spent her entire life foolishly believing things are only laid out in black or white, but now she finds herself stuck in the gray area. The inner battle she faces with her own dark power that she has denied for too long starts to brew all the more fiercely. Kane's coldness breaks her heart even more than it's already broken, but fate's cruel sense of humor forces them to band together despite their torrid conflict. The biggest problem... There are consequences she didn't know she'd have to face after giving herself to Kane, and she finds herself in pain each and every time she's near him. A pain that leaves her feeling like a puppet. Hope rests on the shoulders of her enemies, and her allies pile up in all the wrong forms. When tragedy strikes, she's faced with more dark choices to make. Everything gets twisted, and she becomes stuck in the middle of an internal game of tug-of-war. Gage is there, but he's just as much her enemy as a night stalker. How can she trust any of them? The world is fully of deadly beauties, and deception is their best played game. Alyssa keeps learning the hard way how true this is.
