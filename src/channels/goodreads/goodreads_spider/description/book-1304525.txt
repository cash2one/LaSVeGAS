1304525:::::The Language Police: How Pressure Groups Restrict What Students Learn:::::If you re an actress or a coed just trying to do a man-size job , a yes-man who turns a deaf ear to some sob sister , an heiress aboard her yacht , or a bookworm enjoying a boy s night out , Diane Ravitch s internationally acclaimed The Language Police has bad news for you: Erase those words from your vocabulary! Textbook publishers and state education agencies have sought to root out racist, sexist, and elitist language in classroom and library materials. But according to Diane Ravitch, a leading historian of education, what began with the best of intentions has veered toward bizarre extremes. At a time when we celebrate and encourage diversity, young readers are fed bowdlerized texts, devoid of the references that give these works their meaning and vitality. With forceful arguments and sensible solutions for rescuing American education from the pressure groups that have made classrooms bland and uninspiring, The Language Police offers a powerful corrective to a cultural scandal. From the Trade Paperback edition.
