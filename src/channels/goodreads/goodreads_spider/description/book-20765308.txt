20765308:::::Petting Farm Fun:::::Petting Farm Fun is the third release in the popular Hood Picture Book Series. It is a delightful bedtime story to entertain and then relax young children before they fall asleep. The tradition of the bedtime story has been around since before the written word. For generations, and in every culture, parents have prepared their children for bed by telling them stories. Karen Jean Matsko Hood is a prolific author and poet that loves children and animals. It is only fitting that she would write and direct the art of this delightful petting farm story. Her family has raised Nubian goats, fainting goats, Babydoll Southdown sheep, Icelandic sheep, Icelandic horses, and other petting animals as she knows this is a valuable experience for children. The author and her family also have first hand experience raising chickens, turkeys, ducks, and geese for organic eggs. Her children have actively worked on the goat dairy farm to milk goats for organic milk. All this inspired her to write this book. Petting Farm Fun makes an enjoyable story for readers of all ages as well as those who love animals and have an appreciation for nature and farm life. This book also makes a great gift to share with others.
