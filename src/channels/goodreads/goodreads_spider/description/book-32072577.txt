32072577:::::I Am Funny Like That: A Funny Look At Life:::::I am Funny Like That is a collection of stories about my life and fictional short stories. I enjoy making people laugh out loud, think about things differently or get engaged in a conversation about life. No matter who you are the one thing we all have in common is we like to laugh. It makes us feel better, it makes us like people and it cures the soul. This book was written to get the craziness out of my head and on to paper. It was also written for the mothers, fathers, caregivers, and people in general who are going through life wondering Am I the only one who thinks this way? Well no you are not. Lots of us think that way and laughing about it is how we cope. So grab a cup of tea or a glass of wine, light a candle and curl up with I am Funny Like That and start laughing.
