3105906:::::Towards the Promised Land:::::It is time for Lehi's family to leave the place Bountiful for the Promised Land. But Nephi's older brothers, Laman and Lemuel, believe they are already living in a promised land. Why should they leave their newfound abundance? Challenged with following instructions from the Lord while keeping peace within the family, Nephi forges ahead to build a ship that can cross oceans-but storms at sea are nothing compared to the turbulent relationship between Nephi and his older brothers.--From publisher's description.
