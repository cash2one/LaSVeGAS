23942402:::::The Monster Exorcist:::::Michael here! I see you picked up my book. I knew you would because it s awesome, inspirational, life changing, and most importantly it s all about me! Let s start from the beginning. I was adopted by an old man who named me after his dead son, creepy right? He used to tell me stories of monsters who pose and animals and attack humans. I thought he made it all up to scare me, but then I met a group of exorcists who confirmed my worst fear, monsters are real! If that wasn t enough to freak me out I discovered Grandpa was up to some shady stuff, my sister has secrets stashed away, and any hot chick could be a monster plotting to rip my insides out! God must hate me, because I don t know my own past, my real name, and now my trusted teacher is even trying to kill me and offer me up as monster food!
