30122504:::::The Scribbler Guardian:::::Jeramiah Poe isn t just any character in the Realm of Fiction, he is Muse Master Destiny Diviner Mysterious Miskriat. Being of neither the Traditional Genre Provinces nor Independent, Poe enjoys an eternal lease on life, so long as his Scribbler keeps him out of publication. Poe meets Kane, a seven-year-old boy from the Independent Horror Province, where he learns ancient codes are being broken and the horror that should be an act, is real. But the evil clutching Octava is not new and Seven Arks have been sent to Earth to stop it. Only something has gone wrong and Poe is commissioned as the 8th Ark of Octava to discover what has become of the Seven. But his passage to Earth comes with revelations he's not prepared for. Not only does his Scribbler not know of his existence, he's a she that his human form seems allergic to. Poe soon realizes that with each Ark he locates, his powers grow along with his feelings for the Scribbler. And the enemy will try and use both to gain control of the two realms.
