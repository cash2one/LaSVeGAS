Five of the nine Official White House Photographers are alive today, and in rare personal interviews, they recount the stories behind the remarkable photographs. Expressive close-ups of presidents reveal moments of joy, reflection, and turmoil over public issues and private challenges. Unexpected angles cast new light on historic events. Through both iconic and little-known images, this book offers a fresh perspective on life and work behind the famous facade of the White House. The President's Photographer is the official companion book to the National Geographic Channel special that aired in November 2010.
