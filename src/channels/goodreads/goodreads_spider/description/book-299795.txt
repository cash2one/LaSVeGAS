299795:::::23 Minutes In Hell: One Man's Story About What He Saw, Heard, and Felt in That Place of Torment:::::"My sincere hope is that this book is the closest you will ever come to experiencing hell for yourself." Bill Wiese saw the searing flames of hell, felt total isolation, and experienced the putrid and rotting stench, deafening screams of agony, terrorizing demons, and finally, the strong hand of God lifting him out of the pit. "Tell them I am coming very, very soon!" Wiese s visit to the devil s lair lasted just twenty-three minutes, but he returned with vivid details etched in his memory. Since this life-changing ordeal, he has spent the last seven years studying the Scriptures to find answers and has listed more than 150 Bible verses referencing hell. Everyone is curious about the afterlife, and now Wiese shares his insights to commonly asked questions such as: Is hell a literal burning place? Where is hell? Do you have a body in hell? Are there Degrees of punishment in hell? Are there children in hell? Can Demons torment people in hell? Can "good" people go to hell? "Even if you don t believe my story, I hope you will believe the Scriptures and avoid hell just the same."
