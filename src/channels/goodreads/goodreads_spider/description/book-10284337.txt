The Whippet Hotel is a strange place full of strange and mysterious people. Each floor has its own quirks and secrets. Leo should know most of them - he is the maintenance man's son, after all.

Leo had better be quick on his feet, because the fate of the building he loves is at stake . . . and so is Leo's own future!
