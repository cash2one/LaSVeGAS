18938110:::::The Stinky Cheese Vacation:::::Each Geronimo Stilton book is fast-paced, with lively full-color art and a unique format kids 7-10 will love. I, Geronimo Stilton, was finishing up work one evening when I opened a letter from Uncle Stingysnout. He needed to see me immediately! I headed straight to Penny Pincher Castle for what I thought would be a nice visit . . . but my uncle put me straight to work. Moldy mozzarella, what a terrible vacation!
