12474:::::The Armies of the Night: History as a Novel, the Novel as History:::::One of the first examples of "new journalism" daringly combines reportage with a novelistic style and garnered Mailer his first Pulitzer Prize and a National Book Award. Armies of the Night centers on the March on the Pentagon, the most famous anti-Vietnam War rally in Washington DC, and the characters that occupy this opposition the intellectuals, students, African Americans, liberals, and marching women. Mailer, a novelist-as-character, sculpts this impressionably fragile world of the Left versus Authority and Peace versus War, prodding at the Vietnam generation s deepest anxieties. In the same way Truman Capote's In Cold Blood introduced the "non-fiction novel," Armies of the Night renders this form, with turns historical and fictional.
