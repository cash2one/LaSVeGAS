12864422:::::Sweet Dreams Are Made of Teeth:::::Have you ever had the nightmare of being chased by a beast? Then you ve met Fang. He ll be the first to admit that he s a very simple nightmare. All he knows is hunting your dreams and dragging them into the Dark. He s not ready for his life to get complicated. He s not ready to be dragged into his best friend s schemes to make dreams so terrifying they break people. He s not ready to love, or to be loved, or to meet someone who makes him happy. He s definitely not ready for those to be three different girls. He s not ready to grow up. When he does, one thing will stay the same. He ll stay an artist, and he ll paint your dreams with fear until they re beautiful.
