11104728:::::Frysepunktet:::::Translated from the Danish Frysepunktet. "It started in 1973 when Bruno--a young, orphaned bachelor editor--found a lump in his neck that wouldn't go away. Frozen to wait for a cure for cancer, he first wakes up 22 years later, in 1995. Life in 1995, quite naturally--or unnaturally?--led to life in 2022."
