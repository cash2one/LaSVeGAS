18241419:::::Second Chances:::::Kate Strickland Ross is small-town attorney seeking election to a local judicial position, who has just discovered that her son Trey has been arrested for armed robbery and attempted murder in a neighboring college town. Although she is highly respected in the small town where she practices law, Kate has an ugly secret that, until now, she has successfully hidden for more than twenty years. Her son s legal troubles and the sudden exposure of her dark past now threaten to ruin her chances of winning the election and to destroy relationships with the people she loves. Thanks to Wade Anders, a long-time friend to Kate and mentor to her son, she soon discovers that she is the target of an angry young man bent on revenge for misdeeds he believes Kate committed long ago against his deceased mother. It turns out that the vengeance-seeker, Andy, has been insinuating himself into the lives of the Ross family for years as part of a twisted plot to destroy Kate personally and professionally. Andy s discovery of Kate s secret gives him an advantage in his attempt to harm her reputation and, in his mind, insanely justifies the criminal rampage he has carried out thus far. Kate is forced to face her past, along with the consequences it brings, and in doing so she has to unearth the enormous guilt that she has suppressed for decades. In the mean time, Wade, who is in love with Kate, desperately seeks evidence to clear her son s name, and in the process, discovers that most of the people who have wronged Andy have wound up dead. Alarmed and convinced that Kate s and Trey s lives are in danger, Wade soon shockingly finds himself at Andy s mercy, and he is compelled to reveal a long-held dark secret of his own which could devastate his own relationships with Kate and Trey.
