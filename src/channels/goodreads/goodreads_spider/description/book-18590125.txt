18590125:::::Third Degree:::::I used to be Isabel Jenkins, child prodigy. As lame as that sounds, at least it was an identity. But now I m not sure what I am. I just failed the most important exam of my life the emotional readiness test required to get into a medical residency program and it turns out my parents can t stand each other. Now I m trying to figure out how to pick up the pieces of my life, and that means re-enrolling as a college freshman, but this time I m shutting the books and majoring in being eighteen. But so far, my roommate hates me and I m not into the party scene. The only good thing about school has been getting to know my insanely hot RA. Marshall Collins makes me wonder about everything I missed while I was growing up too fast. Pretty soon we re hanging out constantly, but for the first time, I find myself wanting more than a no-strings-attached physical relationship. And the lesson I really need is one Marsh definitely can t teach me: love. Because I m going to be alone forever if I don t learn fast.
