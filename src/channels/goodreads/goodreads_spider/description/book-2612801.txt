2612801:::::Little House in the Big Woods:::::Wolves and panthers and bears roamed the deep Wisconsin woods in the 1870's. In those same woods, Laura Ingalls lived with her Pa and Ma, and her sisters, Mary and Baby Carrie, in a snug little house built of logs. Pa hunted and trapped. Ma made her own cheese and maple syrup. All night long the wind howled lonesomely, but Pa played his fiddle and sang, keeping the family safe and cosy.
