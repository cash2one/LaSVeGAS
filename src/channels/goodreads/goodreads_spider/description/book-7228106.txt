7228106:::::Lars Saabye Christensen's Beatles:::::This study concerns literary translation strategies, specifically applied to the translation of Beatles - a contemporary Norwegian novel. The novel concerns the cross-cultural impact of the "Beatles" and the production of culture, and its impact on young people internationally, in a dawning age of mass media. Each of the novel's four characters identifies with a member of the group, hence the pseudo-relationship each has with his celebrity idol illuminates how a pop-cultural influence becomes central to developing identities and negotiating adolescence.
