21822308:::::Rose of Avalon:::::At last the second book in the popular "Seven Sisters of Avalon "series has been released! Readers loved book one of the series which told the epic tale of two couples: Bran and Lillian and Phillip and Ophelia, two magical families joined together in a campaign to preserve the safety and freedoms of the Goddess worshiping people of Britain as it slipped into the early Dark Ages. Bran and Lillian's seven daughters are now grown and begin their quests into the seven kingdoms of Britain to return magic to the land and liaison with the country's leaders to protect the people of the Goddess. In this volume, the fiery haired Rose goes into North Wales to meet with the reclusive King Jacob Rowan who no one has seen in many years. What she finds there is as much a magical journey for herself as it is for her quest and a whole new world opens up for her. Filled with adventure, passion, humor, and magic, this book will pull at your heart strings and take your breath away with its exciting and sexy story of a beautiful priestess who meets a king well in touch with his animal side. Although "Rose of Avalon" stands on its own as a beautiful, fast-paced story, but the reader's enjoyment of the series will likely be enhanced by reading "The Daughters of Avalon" first.
