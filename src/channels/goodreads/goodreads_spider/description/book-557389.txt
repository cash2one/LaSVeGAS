557389:::::A Bride Goes West:::::A Bride Goes West is new and fresh because it is impregnated with a just sense of values about life. When Nannie Tiffany of West Virginia married Walt Alderson, who'd already been on the cattle trail for years, in 1882, they went to Montana to start a little ranch. There's plenty about ranching in this book but what is most valuable is about life, about people in this ranch country.
