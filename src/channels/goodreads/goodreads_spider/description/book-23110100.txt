23110100:::::The Leopard Apocalypse:::::The penultimate Tome in the Leopard King Saga. Taking place weeks after the epic battle on the island of Capri, fought between Tullus Acilius Ulixes, the Leopard King, and his nemesis, the Snake Lord Serpentus, the former rogue Tribune, Norbanus Forticus Blandus. Tullus and the Troupe journey to the Alcazar of the vengeful criminal Lord Jarkos Wolfsbane to rescue Celestra the Leopardess, who is being held in a cursed Demonsteel cage, which prevents her from using magic. The final confrontation with the Wolfsbane clan will determine not only Tullus' fate, but that of his friends and allies. Serpentus, using the Serpent Door, travels to the Demon World of Kaotika with a heavily-armed detachment of soldiers, in search of powerful new allies, while constructing infernal War Goblen troops to build his new Serpent Horde Army. Back in Rome, Eliana and her Dryad allies continue their struggle against persecution by the corrupt regime of Emperor Caligula, who is now under the control of the evil Cultist Afaa. But first they must locate a traitor within their midst, who threatens to destroy all they have worked for. In Switzerland, Centurion Decimus and his Legatus, Eolus, must combine their wits and military tact to prevent a massive German invasion that threatens Roman borders. The forces of freedom and oppression clash in the 3rd installment of the Leopard King Saga, as the armies of opposing sides vie for victory on blood-soaked battlefields, and on the high seas, with the end result far from decided. Only one thing is certain: characters will find their destinies irrecoverably changed.
