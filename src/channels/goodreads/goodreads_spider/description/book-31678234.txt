31678234:::::Wuthering Heights:::::WUTHERING HEIGHTS is Emily Bront s only novel. Written between October 1845 and June 1846, Wuthering Heights was published in 1847 under the pseudonym Ellis Bell ; Bront died the following year, aged 30. Wuthering Heights and Anne Bront s Agnes Grey were accepted by publisher Thomas Newby before the success of their sister Charlotte's novel, Jane Eyre. After Emily s death, Charlotte edited the manuscript of Wuthering Heights, and arranged for the edited version to be published as a posthumous second edition in 1850. Although Wuthering Heights is now widely regarded as a classic of English literature, contemporary reviews for the novel were deeply polarised; it was considered controversial because its depiction of mental and physical cruelty was unusually stark, and it challenged strict Victorian ideals of the day, including religious hypocrisy, morality, social classes and gender inequality. The English poet and painter Dante Gabriel Rossetti referred to it as A fiend of a book an incredible monster [...] The action is laid in hell, only it seems places and people have English names there. In the second half of the 19th century, Charlotte Bront s Jane Eyre was considered the best of the Bront sisters works, but following later re-evaluation, critics began to argue that Wuthering Heights was superior. The book has inspired adaptations, including film, radio and television dramatisations, a musical by Bernard J. Taylor, a ballet, operas (by Bernard Herrmann, Carlisle Floyd, and Fr d ric Chaslin), a role-playing game, and a 1978 song by Kate Bush.
