23270403:::::Consolation:::::Liam wasn t supposed to be my happily ever after. He wasn t even on my radar. He was my husband s best friend forbidden. But my husband is dead and I m alone. I ache for him and I reach for Liam. One night with Liam changed everything. Now I have to decide if I truly love him or if he s just the consolation prize.
