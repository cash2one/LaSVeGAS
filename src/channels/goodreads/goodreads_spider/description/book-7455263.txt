7455263:::::Valmonts Trinity:::::This is a stand-alone sequel to Darelle's Trinity. Philippe Mareau, the world's only half vampire-half immortal, is able to feed and be fed upon-just what's needed to reunite Valmont with his beloved protag and estranged lover, Serge. Sent by the priestess of the Coeurs ternels for this special "mission", Philippe's gorgeous blond curls and sleek body of tanned muscles are the perfect tools for his dual seduction. Philippe's erotic attention to Valmont and Serge leads to a hotter-than-hell erotic love triangle, yet when his task is finished, he doesn't want to leave them. There's only one problem. The vampire slayers who once imprisoned Valmont and tried to obliterate vampires from the face of the earth haven't finished with them yet and Philippe is not only the key to seduction for Valmont and Serge but also the prey needed to murder the very vampires he loves.
