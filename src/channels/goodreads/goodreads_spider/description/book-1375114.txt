1375114:::::At Dawn We Slept: The Untold Story of Pearl Harbor:::::Decades after the attack that plunged America into WWII, At Dawn We Slept remains the greatest account of Pearl Harbor ever written. This gripping study scrupulously reconstructs the Japanese attack, from its conception (less than a year before the actual raid) to its lightning execution; &amp; it reveals the true reason for the American debacle: the insurmountable disbelief in the Japanese threat that kept America from heeding advance warnings &amp; caused leaders to ignore evidence submitted by our own intelligence sources. Based on 37 years of intense research &amp; countless interviews, &amp; incorporating previously untranslated documents, At Dawn We Slept is history with the dramatic sweep of a martial epic.
