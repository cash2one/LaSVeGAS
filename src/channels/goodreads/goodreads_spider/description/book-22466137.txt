Now he s ready to settle down, and a quiet suburban life will suit him just fine, if his gorgeous new neighbor is any indication. But when a previous mistake has explosive consequences, John and Erin are thrown together, and it doesn't take long for them to realize that the only way they ll survive to build a future together will by settling the debts of their past. *** Part romantic comedy, part thriller, and filled with plenty of intrigue, The Agent Next Door is the second novel in the Second Service contemporary romance series. ***
