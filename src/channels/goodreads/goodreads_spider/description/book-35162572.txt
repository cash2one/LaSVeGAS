Handsome, rich business man, Christian Grey, enjoys dominating women in the bedroom. With his array of sadomasochistic tools and secret room, he plays out fantasies with women but at the start struggles to form emotional bonds. He meets young and innocent Ana Steele when she interviews him on behalf of her friend and roommate. Soon Christian proposes a relationship with Ana, introducing her to his love ties and binds. Ana hopes to build a caring relationship with Christian and at first agrees to try out some of his suggestions. Christian, haunted by a troubled past, cannot connect with Ana beyond the sex and soon she is driven away by the demand for submission to his sadism. Her innocence and naivety are a stark contrast against his experience in the bedroom. Ana soon leaves Christian, realising he is cold and controlling but they seem to be drawn together no matter what either character believes they have chosen. An erotic romance, this novel is meant for the bedroom.
