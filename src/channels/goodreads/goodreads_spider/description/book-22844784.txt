She only dates married men with limited time and lots to lose. Her latest sugar daddy, Arnold Blake happily funds her business ventures until she finds herself sucked into a truly forbidden love triangle with Tori, her best friend's husband. Tori is the only man she dates for fun. He's gorgeous, well-hung and more romantic than anyone else she's been with. She convinces herself that she is saving Tori from the neglect he's receiving from her best friend. Lauren's choices will lead her down an almost deadly path too difficult to recover from.
