22838084:::::The Divine: Divinity Stone Book Two:::::The legend has become reality, even if the people of Shiloh, Virginia don t know it yet. Starlette McKinley had moved across the US only to find that the darkness raging inside of her wasn t something of her own creation. It wasn t something that could be medically treated by psychiatrists or any type of medication. The darkness was her power, and it was going to stay. When she accepts that the greatest threat of all lies within herself, she will have to choose: Push away all those that she loves in order to keep them safe, or keep them near and witness their deaths. Only through the help of The Divine will she be able to face what is to come. But at what cost? What sacrifice will The Divine demand as payment?
