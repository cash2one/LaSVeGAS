16167446:::::Double Inferno:::::[Erotic Cowboy M nage a Trois Romance, M/F/M, light consensual BDSM, spanking, HEA] Paula Watkins fears dominant men after surviving an abusive relationship. Working at Dixie Chix, she becomes interested in two brothers. One flirts with her like crazy and the other thinks she s too young to play his sort of games. Rumor has it that Matt and Tyler Depolis are practically Doms and they demand control and submission. In a trial run, they expose Paula to the prospects for such a relationship, and she s interested. It will take some convincing for them to prove that they mean no harm, just pleasure. But they re not the only ones interested in one of Dixie Chix's main girls. Someone is stalking her and about to claim Paula as their own. Matt owns a construction company, and Tyler is the fire inspector and arson investigator for Delite. When Tyler, Sheriff Parker, and local detectives figure out that their arsonist and murderer is also Paula s stalker, it may just be too late. Note: There is no sexual relationship or touching for titillation between or among siblings.
