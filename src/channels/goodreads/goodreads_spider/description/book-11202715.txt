11202715:::::Deadly Descendant:::::The second novel in a unique and action-packed urban fantasy series from the acclaimed author of the Morgan Kingsley series! An ancient evil is unleashed in the modern world unless one fearless P.I. can hunt it down. . . . Nikki Glass, Immortal Huntress, returns in this new novel in the acclaimed series by Jenna Black. As a living descendant of Artemis the Huntress, private investigator Nikki Glass knows how to track someone down. But when an Oracle shows up, warning the Descendants about wild dog attacks in Washington, D.C., Nikki is afraid it might be a trap. The Olympians believe the dogs are really jackals, controlled by a blood-crazed descendant of the Egyptian death-god Anubis. Whatever. . . . If Nikki hopes to muzzle Dogboy, she s got to catch him in the act. But when she stakes out a local cemetery, she ends up face-to-snout with a snarling pack of shadow-jackals whose bite is worse than their bark. These hellhounds are deadly even for an immortal like Nikki. Dog spelled backward may be god, but that won t stop Nikki from teaching these old gods some new tricks. Like playing dead.
