17240804:::::Performancegpa: Achieving High Performance Through Service:::::Why Service Matters to your Performance. Too often, we are taught to grow our performance by acquiring new technical expertise and gaining experience within our respective roles. As long as we follow the "process" and do our job, good things will happen for us. The unintended consequence of this approach is a growing dependency of others to manage our growth and our performance. Given the latest talent campaign, "war for talent," it is clear that this approach has not proven to be effective in today's environment. Today's environment requires a different approach where individuals connect to experiential learning opportunities that will engage them intrinsically and grow their capacity and performance in an accelerated pace. I have personally found through experience that a service-based approach will enable individuals to do both, invest in others and in their own performance. I refer to this approach as Grandslam Performance and I refer to the capacity of an individual and organization to achieve Grandslam Performance as their PerformanceGPA (Grandslam Performance Aptitude). As in the sport of baseball, to achieve a grandslam one must bring everyone in to score. When this happens, both the individual and the team perform at a higher level and achieve greater results. This book provides insights into how service directly enables Grandslam Performance, the enablers of Grandslam Performance for individuals, and the implications of Grandslam Performance to organizations.
