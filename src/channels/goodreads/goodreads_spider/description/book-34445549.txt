34445549:::::Alternatives to a Frozen Mouse:::::This wasn t my life to begin with. It wasn t my body either. I inherited both, and more, from Mouse. Mouse created me. She had created another life when she was four so she knew how. That s what people with Dissociative Identity Disorder do. You see, terrible things happened to Mouse when she was very young, so she decided to simply stop growing up when she was eight. Her body aged but she didn t. At eleven, when something even more despicable happened, Mouse froze herself in time, leaving her life, body, and name to me. Mouse remains an afraid and damaged young girl, living in The Deep inside of us. But don t worry, she isn t alone. My name is Jade and I am an alternate personality the main personality but an alternate nonetheless. I live in this body with Mouse and the other alters: Peter, Neil, Jane, Zen, Nancy, Ray, and Lucy. For over twenty years there had been no more splitting, no one new. Then Anne came along, making alter number ten. This book is the first part of our journey integrating Anne into her new life. It was her idea to write about it and both our ideas to dedicate this book to Mouse Our Frozen Mouse the author of us all. http://www.inhousebookstore.com.au/in...
