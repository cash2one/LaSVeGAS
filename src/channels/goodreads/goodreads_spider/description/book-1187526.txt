1187526:::::The Potter's Freedom: A Defense of the Reformation and a Rebuttal of Norman Geisler's Chosen But Free:::::What is Dr. Geisler warning the Christian community about in his book, Chosen But Free ? A new cult? Secularism? False prophesy scenarios? No. Dr. Geisler is sounding the alarm about a system of beliefs commonly called "Calvinism." He insists that this belief system is "theologically inconsistent, philosophically insufficient, and morally repugnant." This book is written as a reply to Dr. Geisler, but is much more; it is a defense of the very principles upon which the Protestant Reformation was founded.
