22892497:::::Hate Me:::::Librarian's Note: This is an alternate/new cover for ASIN B00F4I8V68 I was told if I went away, he'd forget about me, lose interest, and move on. But he hasn't. In fact, my being gone has only made things worse. So it's time for me to take matters into my own hands. It's time for me to fight back. Hey, Vincent. You ready for a little chaos?
