1289866:::::The Slumber of Christianity: Awakening a Passion for Heaven on Earth:::::As believers, our walk with God is motivated by "hope"-not the bland, vague notion most people have, but the expectation of an exotic, pleasurable inheritance that guides us and fires our passion...or, at least, should. Ted Dekker has written an expose on the death of pleasure within the Church. Because many of us have set aside hope and the inspired imagination that drives it, Dekker says we have been lulled into a slumber of boredom, even despondency. Our faith wanes, the joy at having been liberated fades, and we feel powerless. "The Slumber of Christianity" explores what robs us of happiness and how we can rediscover it and live lives that rekindle hope. The pursuit of pleasure is a gift to all humans-a function of the Creator himself, who is bent upon our happiness. It's time for Christians to reclaim our inheritance of pleasure. "The Slumber of Christianity" will inflame hearts toward full-fledged, mind-expanding encounters with hope, through the imagination. "
