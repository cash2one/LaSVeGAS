19170018:::::Capital Punishment:::::Horribly readable - Time Out London s violent football following London is home to some of British football s most notorious hooligans. However, the history of such infamous firms as the ICF, the Headhunters and the Bushwhackers has never been fully documented... until now. From the authors of the bestselling Everywhere We Go and England, My England comes a remarkable and frank examination of football violence involving the supporters of clubs from the capital. They explain not only how these groups have gained and maintained their reputations, but also why hooligans from other parts of the country see a trip to London as their biggest challenge, and how the system of public transport opens up opportunities for those who wish to fight. Each of the major clubs is studied to assess why some seem to attract a more violent following than others and to explain how different inter-club and inter-regional rivalries have evolved. Capital Punishment is an eye-opening study of a problem that refuses to go away.
