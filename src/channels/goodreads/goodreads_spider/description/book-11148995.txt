11148995:::::Unicorn Bait:::::There is an alternate cover edition for this ASIN here . She wants to go home and all she needs is a unicorn. When Naomi discovers a unicorn horn in her late grandfather's belongings, she doesn t actually believe it s real, but her grandfather had meant for her to have it, so she takes it home. While cleaning it, she accidentally pricks herself on the horn's point and is magically transported to another planet that is filled with strange and dangerous creatures. The most dangerous being her brand new husband Lord Tavik. Naomi doesn't know much about her brand new husband, not even what he looks like, and he assures her that if she tries to sneak a peek at his face, he'll kill her. Needless to say, Naomi desperately wants to go home, but that poses a problem because the only way she knows how is by unicorn horn, and the one she had, stayed on Earth. Her best hope is a crazy witch named Agatha, but Agatha is the one who tricked her into marrying Tavik. And then RAN OFF. Naomi must find a way to ditch her husband, find the witch, and get a unicorn to send her back home. It shouldn't be that hard to find a virgin, right?
