19448790:::::Pentimento:::::The day Iris Beaumont turns seventeen, she is threatened to be taken by the Beasts, the rulers of the new America. After the destruction of the world, the Beasts provide citizens with whatever they need in exchange for the one teenage girl they enslave every week. They call them the Brides, and they never comes back. Iris isn t the worrying type though; she s been defying the system since she was ten and never cared for the Beast s rules. Then she meets Colton Ray, who is not like any other boy she s ever seen. His confidence and dominance are otherworldly she can t rationalize the attraction she feels for him. Colton had one slight problem though. It s rumored he is one of the Beast, and Iris could be the next on the Beast s list.
