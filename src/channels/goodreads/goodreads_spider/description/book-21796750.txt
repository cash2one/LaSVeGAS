21796750:::::Grumpy Old Wizards:::::Category six wizard, Josephine O Connor, is called in to help with a series of murders involving dark magic. Unfortunately, the killer covers his tracks very well and destroys virtually all trace of psychometric energy which makes the crime scene unreadable even for a talent such as Josephine. By all rights, Josephine shouldn t be forced to contend with this case. After all, she s a retired eighty-four-year-old and she can hardly be blamed for having a beautiful body akin to a woman in her mid-twenties. It s just one of the perks of being a rare category six. Josephine s problems pile up to insurmountable odds as the killer grows stronger, Detective Riley pesters her for a quick resolution to this challenging case, and her obnoxious neighbor starts harassing her just because she looks too young to live in a retirement community.
