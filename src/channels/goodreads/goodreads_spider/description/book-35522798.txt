35522798:::::New Hope:::::In the aftermath of a devastating alien attack, humans are trying to survive in New Earth - now a scorching shell of what it used to be. Colonies have been created in the other planets of the Solar System, and the destroyed Earth is left to those who choose to stay behind, or those who cannot afford to move to the Colonies. Iolee Panou - newly graduated with three Doctorate Degrees in Linguistics from the Saturn Science University - is tasked to travel to New Earth and translate left-over alien technology discovered at one of the most isolated reservations. Iolee ecstatic at this opportunity and eager to prove herself, realizes she might have gotten involved in way more trouble than she ever thought of. Cove Magnum, Chief of New Hope knows how hard life on the heat and crumbling infrastructure of New Earth is - especially after resigning his position on the Neptune Military to be Chief of the small isolated reservation five years ago. When left-over alien tech is found mere miles away from the res, he knows his already stressful job could become a lot more tense. Iolee and Cove are thrown together not by just trying to solve the puzzle of the left-over alien tech but also by the strong attraction they feel towards each other. When everything they thought they knew comes into question, and the fate of the New Earth and its Colonies could possibly depend on them, will they both find the courage to go after what they think is worth fighting for or will they get lost in the shuffle?
