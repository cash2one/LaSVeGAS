646112:::::Chasing Tail Lights:::::Break free. Before he died, Christy's daddy used to say that when you feel lost, follow the tail lights of the truck in front of you, and they'll get you somewhere safe. Christy keeps chasing those tail lights, but somehow, she's always still lost in Flint, Michigan. Like most teens in Flint, she's dying to leave this dying city. But she's got a secret that she's never told anyone, and it's keeping her chained like a dog to her dead-end life. And she'll never be able to make a fresh start until she's able to reveal that horrible truth and bring herself back into the light. Patrick Jones revisits his hometown of Flint, Michigan, and the darkness that has overtaken this impoverished city in a novel that reveals the chilling reality of growing up on the wrong side of the tracks in America today.
