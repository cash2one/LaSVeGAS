18404980:::::Ink Mage:::::This book is a Kindle Serial. Kindle Serials are stories published in episodes, with future episodes delivered every two weeks (to be complete January, 2014). The city of Klaar has never fallen. No enemy has ever made it across the Long Bridge or penetrated the city s mighty walls. Even when a powerful invading army shows up at the gates, the duke and his daughter, Rina Veraiin, are certain that it poses little threat. But they are cruelly betrayed from within and, in a horrific spasm of violence, the city is brought to its knees. With the help of her bodyguard, Kork, the battle-trained young Rina narrowly escapes the slaughter and makes her way to the lair of an ancient sorcerer the Ink Mage who gifts her with a strange, beautiful set of magical tattoos. Now a duchess in exile, Rina sets out on a quest to reclaim what is rightfully hers, aided by a motley assortment of followers who will help her in her cause some for noble reasons and others for their own dark purposes. With the enemy s agents nipping at her heels, Rina must learn to harness her new and startling magical powers if she is to assert her rightful place as ruler of Klaar.
