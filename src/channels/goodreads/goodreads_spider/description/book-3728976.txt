3728976:::::Sunborn:::::Stars are dying: that's the news that greets John Bandicut and his companions. They must travel to a nebula called Starmaker to discover what force threatens not just the newborn stars, but every world within a thousand light-years. They must journey not just into the perils of a star-forming nebula, but into confrontation with a billion-year-old adversary of life as they know it. Whatever chance they have of stopping the terrifying Mindaru may be found only in the fiery heart of an intelligent sun. Meanwhile, back on Triton, Julie Stone experiences her own encounter with the translator, and she too must make a life-or-death decision in defense of the Earth. Sunborn is Volume 4 of The Chaos Chronicles, from the Nebula-nominated author of Eternity's End.
