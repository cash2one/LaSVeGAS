2883244:::::1 Litre of Tears:::::This diary written by Aya Kit (July 19, 1962 - May 23, 1988) was published shortly before her death. Aya Kit was diagnosed with a disease called spinocerebellar degeneration when she was 15 years old. The disease causes the person to lose control over their body, but because the person can retain all mental ability the disease acts as a prison. So in the end she cannot eat, walk or talk. Aya keeps a diary of not only what she does but how she feels and the hardships she must endure. Initially, the diary's purpose was for Kit to chronicle impressions she had about how the disease was affecting her daily life. As the disease progressed, however, the diary became Kit 's outlet for describing the intense personal struggles she underwent in coping, adapting, and ultimately trying to survive her disease. As she notes in one entry, "I write because writing is evidence that I am still alive." Through family, medical examinations and rehabilitations, and finally succumbing to the disease, Aya must cope with the disease and live on with life until her death at the age of 25.
