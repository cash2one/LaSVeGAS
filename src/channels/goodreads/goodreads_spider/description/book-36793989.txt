36793989:::::Hunter:::::Eden Summers presents a seductively thrilling game of cat and mouse destined to leave you breathless. The hunter has become the hunted. I ve been running for ten years fleeing my past and clawing my way toward an inescapable act of vengeance. Until he walks into my life, sure and strong and full of secrets. He dilutes my thirst for retribution with his touch. He obliterates my need for solitude with his kiss. But it s his hidden agenda that makes the hair on the back of my neck prickle. He wants something. Something that doesn t revolve around sweaty skin and tangled silk sheets like he d have me believe. I have to stop falling for him, otherwise the last ten years will all be for nothing. I need to keep running, keep fighting for vengeance, even though I know he will track me down. But trying to escape him is just another problem. Because now I crave the hunt.
