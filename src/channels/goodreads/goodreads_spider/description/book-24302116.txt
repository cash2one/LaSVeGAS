24302116:::::Harvest:::::Frankie Harlow is an 18 year old university student. She plays carer to her father, who never fully recovered from her mother s death 6 years ago, and essentially had to raise herself. Her father s incapacitation at the hands of love has her sworn off of romance, vowing to never let herself become so dependent on another. Her uneventful life revolves around her study, her father, and her two life-long friends Alyssa and Cameron- until she finds a mysterious locket. In her search for its rightful owner she learns more about the locket s ancient origins, and the deeper she gets, the more it seems to embed itself in her very existence. When a man she had been dreaming about drops dead at her feet and the locket responds, it becomes clear the answer is more sinister than she ever imagined.
