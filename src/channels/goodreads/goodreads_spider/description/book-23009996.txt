23009996:::::Transmuted:::::In this final installment of Cherry St. Croix's adventures, only one thing could compel the disgraced countess to return to Society the threat of immortality. All is not peaceful in the wake of the Midnight Menagerie's ruin. Although the Karakash Veil has been forced to flee its stronghold, the mysterious head of the criminal organization is not content to fade away. Above the foggy drift, a priceless diamond vanishes. In the dangerous Underground, a murderous rampage demands retribution. The hunt for the mastermind behind these misdeeds sends me back to Society and into the unforgiving embrace of the world I'd left behind. Nothing is what it seems. Enemies, allies and a man who struggles with a nature even devotion cannot tame. Torn between the scars of the past and fragile new beginnings, I must create balance in the world I have chosen and with the people I have come to love. The game has changed; should the Veil achieve the immortality it craves, I will have nowhere left to run.
