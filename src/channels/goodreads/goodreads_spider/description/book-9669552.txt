9669552:::::Fort Freak:::::In 1946, an alien virus that rewrites human DNA was accidentally unleashed in the skies over New York City. It killed ninety percent of those it infected. Nine percent survived, mutated into tragically deformed creatures. And one percent gained superpowers. The Wild Cards shared-universe series, created and edited by New York Times #1 bestseller George R. R. Martin (called the American Tolkien by Time ), is the tale of the history of the world since then and of the heroes among the one percent. Now, in the latest Wild Cards mosaic novel, we get to know the hardbitten world of Manhattan s Fifth Precinct or Fort Freak, as cops and malefactors alike call the cop-shop where every other desk sergeant, detective, and patrol officer is more than human. Featuring original work by writers such as Cherie Priest, author of the bestselling Boneshaker ; Paul Cornell, Hugo nominated comic book and Doctor Who writer; David Anthony Durham, winner of 2009 s John W. Campbell Award for Best New Writer; and many others, Fort Freak is one of the strongest offerings yet in the ongoing Wild Cards project.
