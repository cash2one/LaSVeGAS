The careless Nurse screamed in dismay But Bobby was delighted " Long before Richard Scarry or Dr. Seuss, an American artist delighted a generation of children and their parents with hilarious, topsy-turvy illustrations and slightly subversive tales told in rhyme. This was illustrator/author Peter Newell. Originally published in 1910, The Slant Book remains as profoundly enjoyable and incredibly popular as ever. The humorous text and funny illustrations are also slanted to create an adventurous tale. This classic work will delight readers of all ages as they follow a go-cart, a newsboy and a careening baby carriage down a hill. Peter Newell (1862-1924) began his career as an artist drawing portraits, using crayons as his medium. In his fantastic humor, many believe, is the first appearance of the gentle humor of the absurd which The New Yorker has subsequently developed to such a high level.
