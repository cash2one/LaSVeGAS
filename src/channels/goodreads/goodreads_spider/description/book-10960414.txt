10960414:::::The Best of Both Worlds of Essie: Island Style Novel:::::Mrs. Essie Brown was having the time of her life. She was now an honorable matriculated New York resident in New York City, the ultimate big city. However, she never forgets her striving family, which was now dispersed all over the globe. This story concentrates exclusively on Essie's (the main character from The Non-Silence of the LAMB) adulthood years. Unlike The Non-Silence of the LAMB, it doesn't show the relationships with her children's fathers. What it does show is how her children grew up to be responsible business owners and striving members of their society. Essie enjoys visiting them regularly as they were settled all around the world. However, their lives were not all hunky dory. Each child's life carries its own drama and nail-biting events that thrust Essie in the midst of them all. Many of these involved immigration issues and the parity of right and wrong in various sibling rivalries. Essie is forced to take sides and face the consequences of the other's wrath.
