The colour, the madness and the manic deadlines form the perfect harmony of creative chaos she knows she can tackle. Enter Sky-High, the top-rated television network in the country, taking a chance on the yes girl of the century. In a gut-wrenching twist of events, the talented producer meets Satan in stilettoes: a hellish nightmare of a woman who goes by the name Klarissa Maree-Francis. Well-heeled, well-spoken and a subscriber to the mean-girls group in media, Klarissa will make Anna-Simone question her very existence. From Louboutin cliques to live crosses gone wrong, Klarissa is set on making each day difficult for her team of fifteen producers namely Anna-Simone. One by one her team will leave the battalion, shot down too many times, their brilliant ideas lying dead on the cutting room floor. See what happens when two alpha females go head to head. When women sell their souls for a promotion. Where the price of success costs you your sanity. Where the ultimate lows lead to creative highs and where out of the darkness, unlikely heroes emerge.
