22742319:::::SLAM:::::Telepaths, torture, mindwipes ... the Institute has it all, and they use each of their brainwashed children as weapons, the way they see fit. To control society, repress its people. To make certain that they stay in power, no matter the cost. Serena s baby brother Damon is one of those children, and these days he s so altered that he doesn t even recognize her. When it comes to getting Damon away from those who kidnapped him, there's nothing Serena won't do. Even if she has to kill him to save him. First, though, she must prove to her father that she has what it takes to be a soldier against the insidious threat of the Institute. Her first mission has to be perfect. But with inaccurate intelligence, unexpected storms, and Gav Belias, people s hero of the Watch, on the prowl, will she even survive? If she doesn't succeed, they'll never let her go after her brother. And that would be unthinkable, when it was her fault that he was taken in the first place. Slam is Tash McAdam s first work with Glass House Press, and serves as a prequel to the series The Psionics. The first novel, Maelstrom, is scheduled for release in February 2016.
