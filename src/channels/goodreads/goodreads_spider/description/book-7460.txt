7460:::::Security Analysis: The Classic 1940 Edition:::::"Graham's ideas inspired the investment community for nearly a century."-- Smart Money "Graham's method of investing is as relevant today as it was when he first espoused it during the Roaring Twenties."-- Investor's Business Daily Benjamin Graham's revolutionary theories have influenced and inspired investors for nearly 70 years. First published in 1934, his Security Analysis is still considered to be the value investing bible for investors of every ilk. Yet, it is the second edition of that book, published in 1940 and long since out of print, that many experts--including Graham prot'g' Warren Buffet--consider to be the definitive edition. This facsimile reproduction of that seminal work makes available to investors, once again, the original thinking of "this century's (and perhaps history's) most important thinker on applied portfolio investment."
