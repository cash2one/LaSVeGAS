27832513:::::Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas:::::This Barnes and Noble Exclusive Edition of Tim Burton's beloved picture book The Nightmare Before Christmas Tim Burton features an all-new jacket. This beautifully illustrated edition also includes an animated DVD of Tim Burton's original poem The Nightmare Before Christmas, narrated by actor Christopher Lee. In this beloved picture book that could only come from the visionary mind of author and illustrator TIM BURTON, we meet Jack Skellington-- a well-intentioned inhabitant of Halloweenland. Jack is bored of "the scaring, the terror, the fright...tired of being something that goes bump in the night". And so, in an effort to bring to joy to his town, Jack kidnaps Santa and takes his place as the jolly old elf. But instead of bringing joy to the world Jack, who is a little more than a grinning skeleton, brings fear by delivering creepy toys and riding a sleigh carried by skeletal reindeer. Only through a number of things going horribly wrong does Jack learn the true meaning of Christmas.
