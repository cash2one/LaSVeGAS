2961481:::::Spring Water:::::Spring Water by John M. FitzGerald is a book unlike any other in contemporary poetry: a novel-in-verse about an ordinary man who, quietly and without notice, lives the life of a serial killer. This haunting, and disturbingly plausible, collection establishes FitzGerald as an important new voice in narrative poetry.
