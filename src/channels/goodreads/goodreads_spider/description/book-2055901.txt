2055901:::::Yours Truly, Jack the Ripper:::::Jack the Ripper represents the most puzzling unsolved case in history. Pamela West's C.I.D. Inspector West relates in diary entries the gruesome details of the murderseach more brutal and horrific then the one before. Author West has gone to great lengths to provide accurate detail and authentic 19th-century atmosphere, and her introspective, astute Inspector West is a marvel. Tension and terror gain momentum as we are led into the dark slums of Victorian London while the Ripper, his shadow ever present, goes about his business. This is an outstanding work even if one disagrees with the author's conclusion. Doubleday Book Club and Literary Guild alternates. JV Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc
