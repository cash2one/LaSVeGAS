Orchard City is fast becoming the crime capital of the USA. Once a haven of harmony and tranquillity, its now teeming with organised crime, gangs, hookers and corrupt police. It is the sort of place Jack would rather not be in, as he tries to distance himself from his sleazy past and keep on the straight and narrow. But when the disturbing figure of The Executioner begins hunting down the petrified citizens of Orchard city, mercilessly decapitating them and sending shock waves through the community, it brings a new and dangerous dimension to his predicament. And as Orchard city descends into an abyss of despair and all semblance of order is lost, Jack finds himself pushed to the limit of his control and of his restraint. Will he succumb to his old weaknesses? Will he be The Executioner's next victim?
