224538:::::Moominpappa's Memoirs:::::Before he had a family, before he met Moominmamma, Moominpappa led a life of adventure and intrigue. But he's never told his story until now. Now Moominpappa has a bad cold, and it's the perfect time to remember his youthful endeavors and to ponder the Experiences which have made him the remarkable Moomin he is. As he reads each chapter aloud to Moomintroll, Snufkin, and Sniff, they, and we, learn of his triumphs and tribulations, and his momentous meetings with the Joxter, the Muddler, and a cast of other characters too incredible (especially Edward the Booble) to list here. "Moominpappa's Memoirs" has never before been translated into English, and Farrar, Straus and Giroux is proud to be able to add this title to its other Moomin books.
