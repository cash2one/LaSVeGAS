25027140:::::It Takes a Village II: Joining Together:::::It Takes A Village- Top 10 Bestselling apocalyptic erotic love story. Available free to download on kindle unlimited. "The It Takes A Village Series is just the beginning and am willing to wait for the next move. At first I thought I am reading a mystery-thriller but once it got to the better part it has in it a love-story etched in a time when everything has got back to the basics. I am kind of amazed at how the writer plots the way it is perceived of- when the two main characters switched placed in the degree form from each other. It seems different when you try to perceive it at the start, but once you get used to the story-line you tend to understand the whole of it. I can t wait to see and read the next of the series." - After a globally devastating virus sweeps across the world, the ones that are left are trying desperately to survive and pick up the pieces. Paisley Roberts did not have it easy growing up, but the unfortunate knowledge she learned as an adolescent actually elevates her in this new world. She quickly used those skills to forge ahead, creating a place not only in the world, but in the new government controlling the land as well. However nothing is the same, including relationships. Love comes in many forms like before, but a new environment complicates the old fashioned ideas once strongly held. Will she allow emotions to cloud her judgement? Will traditional values hold up when nothing in the world is the same anymore?
