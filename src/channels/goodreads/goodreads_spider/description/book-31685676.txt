31685676:::::Hidden Magic:::::Cass, Nix, and Del are good at two things: finding treasure and killing demons. Lying low is a close third but not because they want to be good at hiding. They re FireSouls, some of the unlucky few to inherit a piece of the dragon s soul. On the surface, the perks are sweet they have the power to find and steal any type of magical treasure, including the powers of other supernaturals. But it doesn t come without a price stealing powers requires that they kill, and others would destroy them if they discover what they are. In a world full of magic, hiding their powers is the only way to survive. That's not too hard, except for the fact that they re being blackmailed by a criminal overlord who holds their lives in his hands. He wants a pair or rare daggers hidden inside a deadly temple. If Cass, Nix, and Del don t get him the daggers, they re dead. But when they get s into the temple, they realize that things are even worse than they d imagined. What was supposed to be a normal job is decidedly not. And surviving it might be impossible.
