2124649:::::Curse of the Red Cross Ring:::::Arguably the best of Earl B. Pilgrim s works, Curse of the Red Cross Ring was first published in the year 2000 and has been praised as a tour de force ( Atlantic Books Today ) and the greatest Newfoundland story ever told ( Downhome ). An epic tale of betrayal set in outport Newfoundland in the 1920s, Curse of the Red Cross Ring is more than just a murder story: it is a masterfully crafted saga that is the Newfoundland character defined. Azariah Roberts, the author s grandfather, was a respected fishing captain and community leader in the small town of L Anse au Pigeon. Living in a remote community on the Great Northern Peninsula of Newfoundland, Uncle Az and his loved ones were unprepared when a murderer came to town. Sod Mugford, whose name resonates with infamy throughout Newfoundland and Labrador, had perpetrated a heinous crime in 1928. And it was only a precursor to the horrific events that were to follow.
