2777561:::::The Unspoken:::::"In five years' time, your greatest fear will consume you. It will rob you of your last breath." Five years ago six children who lived with their families in Jacob Crawley's Divine Path religious cult escaped by burning the compound to the ground. They are reunited at the funeral of Jacob's son, Harold. Harold died of drowning -- his worst fear -- even though his body was found miles from any water. And it seems that each of the teens is marked for murder -- as Crawley had predicted years earlier. Can any of these teens save themselves? Horror author Thomas Fahy now brings his unsettling talent to teen fiction with The Unspoken.
