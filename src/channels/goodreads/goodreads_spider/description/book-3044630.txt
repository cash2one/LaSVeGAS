3044630:::::Silent Scream:::::From the outside, Josh's life looks perfect: he has a loving wife, a beautiful son, money in the bank and a career he is passionate about. But on the inside, he is screaming. Josh has come to the end of the line. For him, suicide seems like the only way out. Raped repeatedly from the age of three by his father and later by his trusted teacher, Josh's childhood was hell. As he grew up, he fought off memories and the shame of his past with a hard-core drug addiction, alcoholism, and an obsession with self-mutilation and self-destruction.With shocking honesty, Silent Scream describes how he struggled to come to terms with the abuse he suffered as a child and the appalling legacy of that abuse. The extraordinary support of his closest friends, extensive treatment in various psychiatric hospitals and the love of his wife and son have pulled Josh through. Against all the odds, he is now able to look forward to a future for the first time. This is a raw and disturbing account of one man's battle to overcome his demons; it is also a powerful testimony to the magic and endurance of love.
