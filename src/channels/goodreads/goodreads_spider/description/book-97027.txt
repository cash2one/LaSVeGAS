97027:::::The Book of Wisdom:::::The Book of Wisdom is not a book of esoteric philosophy. Rather, it is a guide for inner discipline and transformation. It is a book that captures the essence of Tibetan Buddhism and gives us an accessible method for training the mind, awakening the heart, and growing in love and kindness towards others. In short, it is a book that teaches us to live with wisdom.Based on the Seven Points of Mind Training as delineated by the eleventh century Buddhist mystic, Atisha, The Book of Wisdom conveys ancient wisdom with a freshness and spontaneity rarely seen in contemporary works on spirituality. As in his other books Osho displays his extraordinary ability to transform the abstract into the concrete, to translate the spiritual wisdom of the East into a language that is understood by the spiritual seeker from the West. The Book of Wisdom is a contemporary spiritual classic not only for those interested in Tibetan Buddhism. It is for all who are interested in weaving the wisdom of the ages into the fabric of everyday life.
