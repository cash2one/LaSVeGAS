337210:::::The Methuen Book of Modern Drama: Plays of the '80s and '90s:::::Published to celebrate twenty years of Methuen's Royal Court Writers Series, this volume contains five ground-breaking plays of the eighties and nineties. Top Girls : "Builds to a superb, emotion-draining climax that sent me out of the theatre convinced that this is the best British play ever from a woman dramatist." Guardian Hysteria : "One of the most brilliantly original and entertaining new plays I have seen in years." Sunday Times Blasted : "Kane has an acute grasp of sexual politics, and her dialogue is both sparse and stunning. They will call her mad, but, then, they said that about Strindberg." Mail on Sunday Shopping and F***ing : "A real coup de theatre ... a blackly humorous play for today's twenty-somethings." Evening Standard The Beauty Queen of Leenane : "The most wickedly funny, brilliantly abrasive young dramatist on either side of the Irish Sea ... a born storyteller." The New York Times
