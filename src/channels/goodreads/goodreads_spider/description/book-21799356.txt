So she s turning to the dating website she created, MisterGoodEnough.com, to finally find her future. Online matchmaking is perfect for Maddie, because: A) History has proven she s a poor judge of decent husband material. B) The dating pool in her crumbling little hometown is all but dried up. C) She wants babies. Trent Sawyer is not Mr. Good Enough material, because: A) Twelve years ago, he stomped the stuffing out of Maddie s na ve little teenage heart. B) The man might look good in a tool belt, but she s sure he s up to something nefarious. C) He doesn t want kids. Ever. But if Maddie were to fall for a guy like Trent, it would only be because: A) When he apologizes, he apologizes big. B) He s fixing their little farm town, one dilapidated home at a time. C) Her world is a brighter place with him in it. So should Maddie: A) Go for Mr. Second Best and the family she s always wanted? B) Take her Mr. Almost Perfect without the babies she craves? Either way, there s nothing simple about settling for Mr. Good Enough.
