23211458:::::Hemy:::::My name is Hemy Knox and I m a fucking heartbreaker . . . I ve hurt the one person that means the most to me in life; the only woman I have ever fucking loved. I let the drugs, alcohol and wild life take over; consume me. I got her where I wanted her and ripped her fucking heart out. Since then, I ve spent countless nights having dirty, meaningless sex with a multitude of people; only leaving them wanting and begging for more with no regrets. Some may even call me the devil; soulless. They look and judge, but there is one thing they don t know; no one does. I want more than this life of stripping and sleeping around; the never ending party. I want love and everything that comes with it; that high that never ends. The problem is . . . I only want it with her. Onyx. She refuses to be mine . . . again. She s smart and it s a mother fucking pain in my ass; guarding her heart while ripping mine right out of my chiseled chest. I can t say that I blame her. I always was a dumb ass when it came to the emotions of a woman, especially her. She wants to see me suffer as much as I made her; watch me wither and fucking die at her feet. She wants to crush me until I m no longer breathing and I will let her, because it hurts far less than not having her as mine. I will stop at nothing to make her mine again. The pain only drives me harder; feeding my fury and giving me a reason to live . . . her. ***Author's note*** Due to strong language and a very high amount of sexual content, this book is not intended for readers under the age of 18.
