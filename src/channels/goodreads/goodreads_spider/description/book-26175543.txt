When a chance encounter in the boss s office proves that Lacroix is anything but cold, Avery is determined to learn more about the real man beneath the aloof veneer. Despite their growing attraction and their increasingly kinky encounters, the enigmatic Malin remains as emotionally distant as ever. Worse, Avery s friends are convinced Malin thinks of Avery as a dirty secret and nothing more a secret that might destroy both of their careers.
