13422775:::::Lyrics and Poems 1997-2012:::::Often cited as one of the finest contemporary lyricists, singer, songwriter and poet John K. Samson captures the essential images of contemporary life. Whether on the streets of his beloved and bewildering hometown of Winnipeg, an outpost in Antarctica, or a room in an Edward Hopper painting, he finds whimsy and elegance in the everyday, beauty and sorrow in the overlooked. This collection gathers together Samson's writing, starting with his band The Weakerthans' 1997 debut album Fallow , through Left and Leaving , Reconstruction Site , and the award-winning Reunion Tour. It also features lyrics from Samson's newly released solo album, Provincial , and selected poems.
