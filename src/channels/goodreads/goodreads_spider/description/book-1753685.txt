1753685:::::Our Story Begins: New and Selected Stories:::::One of our most exquisite storytellers (Esquire) gives us his first collection in over a decade: ten potent new stories that, along with twenty-one classics, display his mastery over a quarter century. Tobias Wolff s first two books, In the Garden of the North American Martyrs and Back in the World, were a powerful demonstration of how the short story can provoke our amazed appreciation, as The New York Times Book Review wrote then. In the years since, he s written a third collection, The Night in Question, as well as a pair of genre-defining memoirs (This Boy s Life and In Pharaoh s Army), the novella The Barracks Thief, and, most recently, a novel, Old School. Now he returns with fresh revelations about biding one s time, or experiencing first love, or burying one s mother that come to a variety of characters in circumstances at once everyday and extraordinary: a retired Marine enrolled in college while her son trains for Iraq, a lawyer taking a difficult deposition, an American in Rome indulging the Gypsy who s picked his pocket. In these stories, as with his earlier, much-anthologized work, he once again proves himself, according to the Los Angeles Times, a writer of the highest order: part storyteller, part philosopher, someone deeply engaged in asking hard questions that take a lifetime to resolve.
