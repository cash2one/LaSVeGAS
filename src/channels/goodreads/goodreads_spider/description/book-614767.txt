614767:::::You May All Prophesy: Practical Guidelines for Prophetic Ministry:::::The Bible reveals that every Christian can hear from God and speak prophetically to others. This book provides scriptural encouragement and practical instruction to help you: * Discover how God speaks to you * Discern when and how to speak prophetically to others * Understand and interpret dreams and visions * Recognize how prophecy functions in the local church * Overcome obstacles unique to ministering prophetically. Steve Thompson is a skilled prophet. He writes from a wealth of diverse prophetic experience and years of patient scriptural study. You May All Prophesy is the most practical, helpful, and to the point book I have read on prophetic ministry.
