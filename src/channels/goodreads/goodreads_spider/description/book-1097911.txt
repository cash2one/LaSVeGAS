1097911:::::Incas: The Puma's Shadow:::::A sweeping tale of splendor and savagery unfolds as an ancient Incan civilization is haunted by omens, shaken by civil war, shattered by European conquest...and transformed through the power of destined love. Since childhood Anamaya has lived as a captive, waiting to learn how and when she will be offered as a sacrifice. But when the dying emperor, Huayna Capec, summons her, she is granted destiny, not death. Her eyes, as blue as the sacred waters of Lake Titicaca, are a powerful sign that she was sent by Quilla, the Moon Goddess, to ensure the emperor's passage to the Other World -- and she is entrusted with the emperor's last words: the secrets of the past and the future of the Incan empire. Anamaya's new role as guardian of the emperor's Sacred-Double plunges her into the intrigues of Incan politics, the complexities of war...and the passions of a handsome Spanish nobleman, Gabriel Montelucar y Flores -- a stranger marked with the puma, a symbol of Incan spirituality and power. Traveling with the great conquistador Don Francisco Pizarro, Gabriel hungers for grand adventure, exotic wonders, great wealth, and a new life. The entwined fate he discovers with Anamaya will change both of their worlds forever.
