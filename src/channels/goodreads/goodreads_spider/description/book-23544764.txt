23544764:::::Braden's Story:::::Braden is 13, an only child and the member of a devout Christian family, and everything couldn't be better until he begins realizing his attraction for the same sex. Soon, the family that once felt indestructible begins faltering and is seemingly torn apart by the simple fact he struggles to fulfil the expectation of who he's meant to be in the eyes of his parents and God. In fact, everyone seems to know what's best but him. Warning: occasional coarse language and a mild sex scene. Visit: masonscrawls.com for updates on my gay fiction and other musings.
