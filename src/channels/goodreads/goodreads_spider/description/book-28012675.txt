28012675:::::Southern Pleasure:::::They tell you that a parent s love is all consuming. I never put much thought into it. Not until the minute I heard her take her first breath. That little girl is my world. I d do anything to protect her. My ex signed over her rights and her family vowed that my daughter didn t exist. Now that she s gone, they want my little girl. They re trying to say I can t give her what she needs. I ve known Evan all my life. Our families farms run parallel with each other. He and my brother Aaron have been best friends for as long as I can remember. What they re trying to do is wrong. He needs my help, someone he can trust and I m more than happy to do it. I volunteered without hesitation. I should have thought about what it would be like to have our lives intertwined. I should have thought about what would happen when our time together ended and how my heart would feel when I had to walk away. Suggested for readers 18+ years of age.
