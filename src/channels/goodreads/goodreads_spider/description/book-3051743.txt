3051743:::::Mixed Bags:::::When her mom died, DJ had to move in with her grandmother, internationally famous 60s fashion model Katherine Carter. Now Mrs. Carter s opened a boarding home for young ladies, and DJ who would rather wear her basketball team uniform than haute couture is just sure they ll all be unbearable fashion snobs. One by one, the girls arrive and begin to figure out how to fit into this new family, getting to know each other and forming friendships. Sure, there s an aspiring diva or two, but before long, the Carter House girls are dating, fighting, laughing, shopping, sharing clothes, purses, shoes and their deepest secrets. DJ may not turn into the perfect little lady her grandmother has in mind, but one thing s for certain with all these new sisters, her life will never be the same!
