1686466:::::Lock Me Up or Let Me Go: The Protests, Arrest and Trial of an Environmental Activist:::::This is the dramatic and unlikely story of Betty Krawczyk's participation in the struggle between a forestry company and citizens concerned about the fate of the rare ancient forests in British Columbia. Mother, grandmother, and passionate activist, Krawczyk became one of the most visible faces of this struggle, and this book covers her very public (and much publicized) arrest, trial, and sentencing. Despite its serious subject, this book is also energetic, engaging, and funny. Betty's portraits of her mother and relatives in her native Louisiana offer a warm contrast to the drama of the courtroom and the solitude of the prison cell.
