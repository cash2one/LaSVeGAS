92578:::::Wittgenstein's Nephew:::::It is 1967. In separate wings of a Viennese hospital, two men lie bedridden. The narrator, Thomas Bernhard, is stricken with a lung ailment; his friend Paul, nephew of the celebrated philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, is suffering from one of his periodic bouts of madness. As their once-casual friendship quickens, these two eccentric men begin to discover in each other a possible antidote to their feelings of hopelessness and mortality a spiritual symmetry forged by their shared passion for music, strange sense of humor, disgust for bourgeois Vienna, and fear in the face of death. Part memoir, part fiction, Wittgenstein s Nephew is both a meditation on the artist s struggle to maintain a solid foothold in a world gone incomprehensibly askew and an eulogy to a real-life friendship.
