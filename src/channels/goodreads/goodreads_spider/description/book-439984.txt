439984:::::The Chevalier:::::1689 - William and Mary; Queen Anne; George I; The Old Pretender (1715 Rebellion) Annunciata, fiercely loyal to the Stuart cause, follows King James II into exile, leaving her gentle grandson Matt to care for Morland Place. In her absence he contracts an unwise marriage with India Neville, a woman as heartless as she is beautiful, who drives him between the extremes of passionate love and deep despair. When James III - the Chevalier - returns to claim the Stuart throne, the Morlands are reunited in one country. The rebellion fails, and Annuniciata's sons are on trial for their lives, but defeat and even death itself cannot conquer the Morland sprit.
