30127570:::::Shadowy Lights: Fear:::::Can they overcome her fears and stand together? Lady Geela Glee Beaulieu had only ever loved one man. The perfect man. At least in her mind. He was her best friend and her only lover. She trusted him more then she trusted anyone else in the world. He was her world. Yet still she hesitated, her steps faltered. Her mother s history weighs on her shoulder like an anvil does a ship. Prince Andris Port loves Glee. He always has but he became tired of fighting her fear. He watched as she struggled to forget the past and ignore those whose judgment should not matter. He walked away from her and found someone new. Yet when Glee walks into the room he only sees her. When she speaks he only hears her. And when the world comes crashing down on her. Andris wants to protect her.
