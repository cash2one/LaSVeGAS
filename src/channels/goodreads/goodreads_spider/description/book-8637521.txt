8637521:::::Grey's Awakening:::::Greyson Cole needs to get out of Raleigh. Everywhere he turns, he sees people falling in love, getting married and starting families. It s enough to make a grown man want to rip out his own hair. And for a cynic like Grey, one more employee getting engaged signals the need for a long overdue vacation. Grey owns a cabin in the mountains he has never even used, and he figures that s just the ticket out of this nightmare of happily paired-up couples. Grey doesn t expect to be greeted by a belligerent, half-naked man the minute he opens his cabin door. Sirus Wilder has known Grey s twin sister for years, and she has given him permission to stay in the cabin while his residence across the lake is under repair. Sirus has never met Greyson Cole before, but he is thankful when the man lets him share the cabin for a few days. There is plenty enough room for them each to keep to themselves. Sirus has had his heart broken and isn t interested in a hook-up, let alone something more. Even so, Grey is, hands-down, one of the sexiest men Sirus has ever seen. Too bad he s an arrogant ass and his eyes are so damn cold. Every once in a while, though, Sirus thinks he sees a hint of fiery passion in the controlled man sleeping one room away. For Grey, one look at the roughly handsome Sirus puts Grey s celibacy pact in serious jeopardy. One problem: Grey doesn t believe in love, has even less patience for relationships, and he refuses to get mixed up in another messy romantic partnership that can only end badly. Two weeks. Two hard men. Both running like hell from love. Look out. Something s gotta give.
