The reader is immediately drawn into the story and thus begins an unforgettable ride into other worlds, other possibilities. Stillpoint will make you think, make you examine what lies at the root of your beliefs. Some books shift the way we see the world, even ourselves. This is one of them! Mallard asks: Why are the Palestinians and Israelis still fighting after almost seventy years, what can we do about it, you and me? He suggests we become aware of the facts hidden behind the beliefs and ideology. You ll not finish this novel in the same place you started. To see with someone else s eyes brings understanding and understanding itself opens the door to peace. It would be misleading to leave the impression this book is solely about the Middle East. Although a great deal of the story takes place there, it is in fact, a deep exploration of justice and injustice in the perpetuation of conflict. It is about war and peace, poverty and wealth, leadership and service, and what lies behind the fiery violence of religious fundamentalism. What is unusual about the book is that Mallard approaches events from the perspective of the practical wisdom and insight inherent in Zen, Taoism and Advaita Vedanta. In Stillpoint he has fashioned a love story to the great mystery of life, it is definitely a novel worth reading more than once. A great story with a stunning conclusion.
