12413953:::::Fast-Tracked:::::Study hard, do well on your assessment, and you'll be rewarded. The phrase had been repeated throughout Alexandria's life. A person's rank on their assessment test determined everything. Their job, where they lived, and even who they could marry. At least that's what Alexandria thought before she received the results. Alexandria's assessment elevates her to fast-tracker status, but Byron, her best friend turned true love, isn't as lucky. His results sink him to the lowest possible rank and a guaranteed life of hardship and misery. Everything Alexandria believed is a lie. Fast-trackers run the country. Anger one of them and your whole world could fall apart. Anger one of them and the people you love suffer. Disillusioned, Alexandria plunges herself into the fast-tracker's world in hopes of helping Byron. But can she help Byron before she completely loses herself to the allure of their lifestyle?
