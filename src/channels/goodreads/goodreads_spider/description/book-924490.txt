924490:::::The Other Side of the Dale:::::Gervase Phinn -- "Your name sound like a brand of French yoghurt, "someone tells him -- is appointed a school inspector in North Yorkshire. His stories, full of warmth, wisdom and wit, are brought together in this collection set against the backdrop of the beautiful Yorkshire Dales. At the centre of the tapestry of brilliantly portrayed characters -- which include his fellow inspectors, the wildly eccentric caretaker of the Staff Development Centre, the sporting chairman of governors, the visiting Ministry bigwigs -- are the devoted teachers and their utterly unpredictable charges. He tells the story of the infants' nativity play where the Virgin Mary is found to have nits, of his skirmish with the Lord of the Manor, of matters concerning the fairer sex, and many other tales of the delights, disasters and dramas of a school inspector.
