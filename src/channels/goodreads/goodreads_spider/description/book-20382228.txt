20382228:::::Auslander:::::A skinhead attack on a Turkish schoolboy links four protagonists: Dannaks, promoted to Oberkommissar, leaves Drugs to join Soko REX, a small unit that deals with racism and extremism. The unit is often seconded to assist Homicide, most recently because a serial killer is on the loose in Hamburg hanging right-wingers. But helping Homicide takes a backseat as Dannaks comes terms with his new duties and gets embroiled in a private police-corruption investigation. Craig, a British reporter, writing about racism in Germany, uses the schoolboy attack to exacerbate tensions between Left and Right. Cenk, a Turkish youth, joins a gang with the noble idea of protecting the community against such attacks. But the gang takes on a life of its own. Karsten, a celebrated neo-Nazi, finds himself at a crossroads. As leader of the 211ers he is like a weary gunslinger forced to continually satisfy his minions' banal need for action.
