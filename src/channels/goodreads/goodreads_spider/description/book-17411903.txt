17411903:::::Cinderella in Skates:::::Natalie Melter hates that her family made her leave sunny Arizona to move to Wisconsin but she s even more upset that her dad, a former hockey player, tells her that she can move back to Arizona in the summer only if she makes her school's hockey team. Natalie doesn't know the first thing about standing up on a pair of ice skates, but life in snowy Wisconsin is about to get a whole lot more interesting when the cute college hockey player next door decides to teach her the sport he loves. Will Natalie put it together in time to make the team or will Shane be a distraction she can t ignore?
