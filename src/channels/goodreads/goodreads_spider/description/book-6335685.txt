6335685:::::Within My Heart:::::Sometimes the greatest step of faith is taken neck-deep in feat. Determined to fulfill her late husband s dream, Rachel Boyd struggles to keep her ranch afloat with the help of her two young sons. But some days it feels as though her every effort is sabotaged. When faced with a loss she cannot afford, she s forced to trust Rand Brookston, the one man in Timber Ridge she wishes to avoid. And with good reason. He s a physician, just like her father, which tells her everything she needs to know about him. Or so she thinks... Dr. Rand Brookston ventured west with the dream of bringing modern medicine to the wilds of the Colorado Rockies, but the townspeople have been slow to trust him. Just as slow in coming is Rand s dream to build the town a proper clinic. When a patient s life is threatened, Rand makes a choice one that sends ripples through the town of Timber Ridge. And through Rachel Boyd s stubborn heart.
