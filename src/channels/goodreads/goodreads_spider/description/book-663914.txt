663914:::::The Case of the Dog Camp Mystery:::::Bow-wow! Ashley and I and our basset hound, Clue, packed our bags for Camp Barkaway -- a special camp for dogs and their owners. We took Clue to fun doggie classes like "Paw and Draw" and Stretch and Fetch." We were all having a blast -- until Clue disappeared from our cabin! Did someone kidnap her? Or did she run away? One thing was sure: Clue was dog-gone -- and it was up to us to find her!
