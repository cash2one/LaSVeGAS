25371839:::::Thrall:::::This is what s going to happen. You re going to run, and I m going to chase you. I've spent a lifetime hunting her, years of frustration, near misses and lost chances. Now I have her. Alone, cornered, and desperate. There will be no escape for her this time. Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide. She's finally mine. I just hope I can save her. --- I have no memory of my past life. Not even a name. All that remains is an aching sadness when I see the spot on my finger where a ring used to be. Now I'm not even human, if I ever was. I sleep like the dead through the day, and at night hunger drives me to hunt and kill. My prey are the worst humanity has to offer, but who is the real monster, when I slaughter them like animals for their blood? Until him. Now I'm the hunted. He's stronger, faster, I see my own hunger reflected in his eyes... ...and he knows who I am.
