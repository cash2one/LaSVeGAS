7279151:::::The Old Life Is Dead...L'Ancienne Vie Est Morte...: Poems in English and in French/Poemes En Anglais Et En Frana Ais:::::"Xenia Sunic is a marvelously sensitive wordsmith and the fact that she is a multilingual poetess renders her poetic accomplishments even more impressive. One can only hope that more of her poems will follow the publication of this work." (Dr Paul E. Gottfried) "Xenia has the uncanny ability to commit to paper the triumphs and tragedies of the natural world with its wonderfully emotive imagery of love, nostalgia and rebirth." - Troy Southgate (author, 'Tradition &amp; Revolution') "C'est avec plaisir et satisfaction esth tique que j'ai lu et relu les po mes de ce recueil. Xenia est un virtuose verbal merveilleusement sensible, et le fait qu'elle soit une po tesse multilingue rend ses exploits po tiques encore plus mouvants. On ne peut qu'esp rer que d'autres po mes suivront la publication de cet ouvrage." (Paul E. Gottfried) "Xenia Sunic, whose first name in Classical Greek means "foreign lady," is a foreign spirit indeed to this most shallow age of Western decline. Her poetry is deep, it is mystical, it is achingly aesthetic -- and like all great art requires the reader to co-work, to participate, to ascend to an image-realm, to vault to a rarified, stark, new-old, sun-shadow world." (John de Nugent) "In the nature poetry of Xenia Sunic there is an element of rapture and an aura of mystery in the poet's exquisite responsiveness to and almost mystical expression of the change of seasons and a profound delight in the sheer loveliness of nature in its more solemn as well as in its more ecstatic moments." (Joseph Pryce) "For me, Xenia's poetic muse reminds constantly of just what the expansive heart's creative beauty is capable of andwhat one day may be possible for all of us." (Mervyn Soskolne)
