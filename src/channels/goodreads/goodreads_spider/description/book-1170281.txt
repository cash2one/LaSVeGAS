1170281:::::Katie John:::::Ten-year-old Katie John Tucker did not look forward to the summer she and her parents were to spend in the enormous old house in the small southern town. She hadn't wanted to leave her friends, and she wished that fall would come quickly.But in spite of all her gloomy predictions, Katie John had a wonderful summer. With her new friend, Sue Halsey, she explored the old house and found it full of exciting surprises. The girls founded a society to improve people, and "improved" Sue's infuriating older sister with amazing results. The summer flew by and fall arrived all too soon. Playing a more responsible and adult role than ever before, Katie John was instrumental in deciding her family's future. Young readers will be delighted by impulsive, warm-hearted Katie John, for, as the "Virginia Kirkus Service" review says, Mrs. Calhoun "imbues her story with a good feeling of locale, a strong sense of seasonal Change, and above all a vigorous portrayal of an appealing and lively heroine."
