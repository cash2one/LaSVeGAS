1570434:::::A Place In The Woods:::::Helen Hoover and her husband, Adrian, were trailblazers in the American back-to-the-land movement. Well ensconced in their professional lives in Chicago, they made the decision to follow their dream of a simple existence, pulling up their stakes and plunging into the wilds of northern Minnesota. A Place in the Woods, first published in 1969, describes how the Hoovers gradually adapted to the rigors of wilderness survival, relating events that occurred prior to those Helen Hoover described in her bestselling The Girl of the Deer. This is a tale of starting out, of the pitfalls of beginning a new life -- one punctuated by near disasters but also by moments of rare beauty. A Place in the Woods is enlivened by warm, humorous anecdotes showing both the struggle and reward involved in joining this small community of rabbits, deer, and distant neighbors. This volume, now available in paperback for the first time, conveys the special joy of each small victory in the wilderness.
