2253258:::::Pashtun Tales: From the Pakistan-Afghan Frontier:::::These stories were collected in the tribal areas of the Pakistan-Afghan border, a region once described as the last free place on earth , where the caravan routes from Persia, India and China historically converged. With a blend of wit, fantasy, comedy and romance, these tales reflect the Pashtun code of honour and way of life, now seriously threatened by social changes and political upheaval. Aisha Ahmad obtained her PhD from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. She has done research on Pashtun women in the tribal areas and has worked as a consultant for the World Health Organization.
