26571344:::::Christianity in These Last Days:::::Writing this book has been a joy. It is my gift to Christians living in these last days and to every individual who has been disappointed by organized religion yet has honest, heartfelt questions regarding God and his own spirituality. It's been said that Satan's greatest achievement is convincing individuals that he doesn't exist. If that is true, then his second has to be convincing them that Christianity is just one of the many religions of world. It's a lie! Over and over again in the Bible God says Christianity is a covenant, never a religion. Discovering this covenant is like finding a priceless forgotten treasure ... Becoming a part of it will rock your world.
