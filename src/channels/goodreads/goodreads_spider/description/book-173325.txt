173325:::::When God Whispers Your Name:::::Are you ready to hope again? Are you ready to let go of doubt and sorrow? Just listen carefully. God is whispering your name. Somewhere, between the pages of this book and the pages of your heart, God is speaking. And He is calling you by name. Maybe that's hard to believe. Maybe you just can't imagine that the One who made it all thinks of you that personally -- that He keeps your name on His heart and lips. But it's true. In the Bible and in the circumstances of your life, He whispers your name lovingly. Tenderly. Patiently but persistently. Let these stories remind you of the God who knows your name. Some of the stories are from the Bible. Some are drawn from everyday life. Most are about people who are lost ... or weary ... or discouraged -- just like you may be. If you let them, they will tell the story of your life. And the story of a God who speaks into your situation. So listen closely as you turn these pages. Listen for the Father's gentle whisper that can erase your doubt, your sorrow, your weariness, your despair. It really is your name that you hear, and the Voice that calls is more loving that your ever dared dream. Listen. And learn to hope again.
