882577:::::Doctor Who: Love and War:::::On a planet called Heaven, all hell is breaking loose. Heaven is a paradise for both humans and Draconians - a place of rest in more ways than one. The Doctor comes here on a trivial mission - to find a book, or so he says - and Ace, wandering alone in the city, becomes involved with a charismatic Traveller called Jan.
