23236763:::::Pushed:::::Tyler really needs the advertised nursing job after the recent break-up left him with nothing more than a bag of clothes and his car. To his surprise, the child he thought he would be caring for turns out to be a fully-grown, angry, young man who appears to be busy feeling sorry for himself. Jason is more than fed up at his mother s attempts to coddle him while he is fighting his own demons. When the new nurse appears, he tries to send him packing straight away. He doesn't need or want anyone's help. The two strike a deal to help them with their situation, working together to try and piece back their broken lives and find a way to move forward. Overcoming their differences and finding common ground isn't easy at first, but Tyler is convinced he can prove to Jason that there is so much more to look forward to. A little trust and honesty can go a long way into helping both of them heal and show that sometimes it takes just a gentle push to make big things happen.
