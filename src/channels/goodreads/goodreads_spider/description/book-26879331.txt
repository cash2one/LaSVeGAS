26879331:::::Confident:::::Life is too short to doubt yourself. There are infinite pathways you could take in this lifetime; the key factor to ensure you fulfill your dream life is confidence. To change, you must be confident in believing you can. You have a divine right to be alive. Nobody can take that away from you; however, a lack of confidence will limit you in countless ways. Every moment is fleeting, and every situation whether big or small will be enhanced by confidence. That s why, after embarking on a solo, eight-month journey of self-discovery through Zambia, Botswana, and the UK at age sixteen Alice Lamont wrote an entire book on the subject. In ten chapters, Confident can teach you about confidence and why you need it, lessons on self-love, how to utilize the power of habits and optimism, conquer fear, and lift off of life s glass ceiling. Confident is a concise, powerful self-help book that will aid you in realizing you can do and be anything.
