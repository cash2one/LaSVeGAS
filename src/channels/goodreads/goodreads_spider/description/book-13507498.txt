13507498:::::Dragon's Moon:::::He s a dragon intent on saving his people from destruction by the Fearghall and she is a wolf who blames the dragon for the deaths of her brother and mother. They re true mates, but will that be enough to overcome ancient prophecies, debilitating visions and a dragon s fire? When Erik, the only living dragon shifter, and prince of the Ean, killed her brother, Ciara was left alone to face her prophetic dreams. Now, in order to find the wolves sacred stone and save all the Chrechte from destruction, she needs her enemy s help. Erik was only protecting the children of his people, but that day in the forest left a mark on him as well. Controlling his dragon s fire is the most difficult thing he s ever done until he and Ciara are forced to face not only their shared tumultuous past, but a hallowed bond stronger than they realize. As avowed enemies and predestined mates, their quest ushers them into a world of great danger, and a passion hotter than the dragon s fire.
