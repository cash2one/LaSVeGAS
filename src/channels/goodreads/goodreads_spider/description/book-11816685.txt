11816685:::::Baked in America: The Generous Art of American Baking - Brownies, Cupcakes, Muffins and More:::::When it comes to baking, Americans clearly know a thing or two. Whether it's gooey chocolate brownies, perfectly iced cupcakes or chunky chocolate chip cookies, American baking is everywhere, and we love it. Baked in America is a bumper-sized celebration of American baking. From their London bakery, Outsider Tart, Americans David Muniz and David Lesniak are spearheading a welcome revival of the humble home-baked American cake (and brownie, and muffin and cookie!) and introducing us to a whole load of newcomers along the way. Their irresistible cookbook contains over 120 American recipes ranging from classic favourites such as juicy blueberry muffins, chocolate and walnut brownies and peanut butter cookies to a strawberry meringue torte, white chocolate and raspberry cupcakes, red velvet cheesecake and an outstanding array of whoopie pies. With full colour photography throughout and a stunning design this cookery book will be every baker's dream. Resistance will be futile.
