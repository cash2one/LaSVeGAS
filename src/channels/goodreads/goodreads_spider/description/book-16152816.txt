16152816:::::Dare The Devil:::::Welcome to Glacier Country! Luthor Devlin and his ranch hands were out tracking 20th-century rustlers when they stepped into a time warp! There on the jagged cliffs was a woolly mammoth, a sabre-toothed tiger, and a tawny, near-naked savage. She was a primal fantasy come true - that left him stunned! His gaze locked onto hers. "I'd really appreciate an explanation of all this. You, the hairy elephant, and the cat with the overbite are not the norm in Montana. And I know you can understand my every word. So anytime you'd like to begin." Her relaxed appraisal hadn't gone unnoticed by either the man or the large tiger. The latter proved her undoing. His mouth opened not to snarl again but to emit a long, loud, kittenish yawn. The tiger rolled over, rubbed his back and shoulders into the ground, his hind legs spread-eagle, yawned again, and pawed sleepily at his face. To the amazement of everyone, his sword-like teeth fell out. "Damn it, Pumpkin, why couldn't you have just growled!" She extended her hand. "Cam Stirling, action technician." At his confused expression, she sighed. "Stunt woman." She was wild, irresistible - and he was the man to tame her. She dared the devil every day - why not Luthor Devlin!
