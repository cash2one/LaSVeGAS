26829496:::::He Who Dares:::::Jack-the-lad, wheeler-dealer and international playboy (just ask the manageress of El Sid's, Torremolinos, 1978), this was a man destined for greatness. One day he would mature into an award-winning man of business*, thriving entrepreneur and glittering member of the jet-set. A force of nature, a man who beat the odds, if only for a bit. This is his story. The story of Derek 'Del Boy' Trotter. Who else could tell the glorious tale of rags to riches to rags to rich(ish) but the man himself? You've heard of The Wolf of Wall Street, now meet the Pug of Peckham. *Trotter's Independent Traders, employee of the year 1982 - 2003
