17909617:::::Burn:::::Here's how it's going to be, Goddess. Until you surrender yourself to me fully, I will not touch you. Until the world can know you belong to me, I will not kiss you. I'm going to be inches away, at your side. I'm going to whisper in your ear and put my breath on your neck, but the heat of my skin will not feel the shudder of yours until you commit yourself to me completely and without reservation.
