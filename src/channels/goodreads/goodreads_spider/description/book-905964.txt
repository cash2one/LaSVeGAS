905964:::::Summer of my German Soldier:::::With her Jewish identity, expansive vocabulary and tomboy spirit, twelve-year-old Patty Bergen is a social outcast in the small-minded community of Jenkinsville, Arkansas. Her one saving grace is Ruth, the kindhearted housekeeper who shields her from an emotionally distant, physically abusive father and a self-absorbed, hypercritical mother. Then she meets Anton -- warm, educated, polished, handsome -- and an escaped German prisoner of war. In accepting his friendship, Patty rejects a society built on prejudice, labels and appearances rather than personal integrity, and undertakes a risk that will change the course of her life.
