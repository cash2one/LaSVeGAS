827681:::::Essays in Love:::::Essays in Love will appeal to anyone who has ever been in a relationship or confused about love. The book charts the progress of a love affair from the first kiss to argument and reconciliation, from intimacy and tenderness to the onset of anxiety and heartbreak. The work s genius lies in the way it minutely analyses emotions we ve all felt before but have perhaps never understood so well: it includes a chapter on the anxieties of when and how to say I love you and another on the challenges of disagreeing with someone else s taste in shoes. While gripping the reader with the talent of a great novelist, de Botton brings a philosopher s sensibility to his analysis of the emotions of love, resulting in a genre-breaking book that is at once touching and thought-provoking.
