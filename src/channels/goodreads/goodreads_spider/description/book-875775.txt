875775:::::Mission:::::Easter Sunday. The naked body of a 35-year old man is rushed into Manhattan General Hospital. He has a two-inch stab wound below his rib cage and nail wounds in his feet and wrists. The impossible has happened: Jesus Christ has appeared 7000 miles and 20 centuries away from the Crucifixion- dead on arrival. What can the witnesses do? What would you do? MISSION is powerful and compelling fiction by Patrick Tillet, author of FADE OUT. It is also a stunning reassessment of the central truths and deepest beliefs by which we live.
