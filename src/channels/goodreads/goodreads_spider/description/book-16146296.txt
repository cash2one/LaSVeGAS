16146296:::::The Jaws of the Vortex:::::An abandoned insane asylum re-opens in Landmark, Oregon. It appears to be a haunted house more weird than scary but turns out to be a portal into the Underworld. Ryan and Aquila must figure out what s going on the two-way movement and try and stop it. Livingston, a bullfighter-slash-mad scientist, affixes dead souls to human effigies, paving the way for a mass infiltration. Ryan believes Livingston, or their tour guide Whitlock, is the ghost of the old Asylum director (who went mad and burned the place down). Ryan, the narrator, dies halfway through but it s a blessing in disguise, so he can enter Hell to rescue some others, already entangled in the wars and intrigues of the Six Kings of the Underworld.
