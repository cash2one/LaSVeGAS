35958:::::Sagwa, the Chinese Siamese Cat:::::"Before you go out into the world," Ming Miao told her five kittens, "you must know the true story of your ancestors...." And so begins the story of Sagwa of China, a mischievous, pearl white kitten. Sagwa lived in the House of the Foolish Magistrate, a greedy man who made up rules that helped only himself. One day, Sagwa fell into an inkwell and accidentally changed one of the Foolish Magistrate's rules. Little did Sagwa know she would alter the fate -- and the appearance -- of Chinese cats forever!
