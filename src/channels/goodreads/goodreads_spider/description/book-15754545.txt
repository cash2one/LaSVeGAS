15754545:::::Cultivating Your Inner Life:::::Cultivating Your Inner Life, the latest book from Pastor Edmund Chan, is an in-depth reflection on the topic of spiritual formation through discipleship. In this book, he shares on how the overemphasis on numerical growth and outward manifestations of the Christian faith has been sapping the vitality of the church and affecting how non-believers perceive Christianity. This is because many Christians do not live lives which reflect their faiths due to misunderstandings about what it really means to live a life of intimacy with God. Using his own life-experiences as examples, Edmund Chan pays special attention to dispelling the myths and obstacles that are hindering the spiritual growth of a Christian and provides the guidance that is needed to overcome them. He also touches upon some pitfalls that many Christian fall into such as serving without joy and shows us what we can do even when we are struggling to understand the will of God. The author used his personal life experiences to illustrate his points on christian growth. One of the book's main topic is intimacy with God. The book discussed several myths that people believe about intimacy with God. Here are the 4 myths: &gt; Intimacy is the key to blessing &gt; Intimacy is a prize &gt; Intimacy with God is optional &gt; Intimacy is experienced the same way by everyone Rev. Edmund Chan stated 4 truths to contradict the 4 myths. The 4 truths are: &gt; God delights in intimacy with us and invited us to it &gt; Intimacy is a God-given birthright for all &gt; Intimacy takes trust and not just time &gt; Intimacy with God results in redemptive acts of love
