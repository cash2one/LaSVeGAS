22494161:::::Summer by Summer:::::When Summer took a job as a nanny for a couple vacationing in Belize, she imagined it would be a fresh start before starting college in the fall. And while she adores her charge, Josh, she can t say the same for her employers oldest son, Bray. He s cocky, inconsiderate, and makes her feel she s a chore he has to put up with. In short, he s everything she dislikes in a guy. Bray had a plan for the summer: party, hang out with friends, and forget all the responsibilities waiting for him back home. But every time he s forced to be around Summer, her dour, serious mood sets him off. Not to mention she has a habit of picking up on what he already knows is wrong with him. Then the two find themselves on a dive trip gone wrong, stranded on a remote island. As they focus on survival, their differences melt away, and they find being together may be what both needed all along.
