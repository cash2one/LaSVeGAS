He attended the Bahriji School (Oasis,) in The United Arab Emirates in preparation for serving in Harems for the wealthy and elite. It is also a love story between the young man and his Valet who served as his chaperone and mentor during the boy s Harem service. I had a privileged and unique upbringing in Malaysia, where I was known as a "sissy boy." Following in my brothers' footsteps, I was sent to an exclusive boarding school in England. It is there that I was inducted into a clandestine organization, E.R.O.S. The Enlightened Royal Oracle Society. For four years, unbeknownst to my family, I was willingly and happily part of a Harem. My story has been kept under wraps for close to 45 years. The correct moment has arrived for me to make known my unique education. Show less
