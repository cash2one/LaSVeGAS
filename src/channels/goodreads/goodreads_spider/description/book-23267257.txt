23267257:::::The Proverbs 31 Lady: Unveiling Her Secrets Before Saying I Do:::::The Proverbs 31 Lady is the epitome of success. Not just one area of life but in health, Spiritual, financial, relationships and business. She stars a chord in all of our hearts. She makes us want to learn to respect and use our own ideas and instincts to write our life story. We want our life story to soar to new heights every time we read about her. We want to make a difference in the world. To be her, you ve got to clear your path, reduce the time-sinks and burdens weighing you down, and pick up the things that give you wings. You ve got your biggest goals close to your heart and dedicate time to them every day. To be her, you realise you have to be perfect. You realise it is possible for a woman to make the treasures of the Proverbs 31 Lady real in your life; after all you are only human. The Proverbs 31 Lady is an elephant and it is impossible to eat an elephant. The truth of the matter is that Proverbs 31 does not refer to a single day in a woman s life! Most women have felt overwhelmed by this description. Rather, it represents an overview of a lifelong pattern of growth and development. The Proverbs 31 Lady is an elephant and it is impossible to eat an elephant-in one bite. Unfortunately we have lost sight of the simple but profound principles of what it takes to be a successful woman- The Proverbs 31 Lady. I wrote this book to help you find your way back to the basics. Master those principles; repeat them over an extended period of time and the payoff will be extra ordinary.
