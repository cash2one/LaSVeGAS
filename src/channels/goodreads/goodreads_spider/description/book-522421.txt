522421:::::Lost in NashVegas:::::Last week, I was stocking groceries in Freedom, Alabama. This week, I live in Nashville, Tennessee, about to take the stage at the famous Bluebird Cafe. Sounds fantastic, doesn't it? Only one problem, I 've got stage fright. But after years of being ruled by fear and hiding from my dream, I confronted my limited reality and left home. Forget the hometown hunk who wants to make me queen of his double-wide. Forget Momma's doubt-inspiring tirade. I can make it in Music City...can't I? In a leap of faith, I gathered my old guitar, my notebook full of songs, and packed up my '69 Chevy pickup. Look out NashVegas! With the help of some new friends, especially handsome Lee Rivers, my dream is about to find the light of day. But as I face my first night at the Bluebird Cafe, I realize...I might just do what comes naturally. Look for the nearest exit, and run!
