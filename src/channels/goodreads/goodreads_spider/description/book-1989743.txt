1989743:::::Love Is Never Painless:::::Three prolific authors bring truth to the title of this heart-wrenching book, Love Is Never Painless , with a collection of novellas that explores the deeper side of love -- the side rarely explored in love stories. In Eileen M. Johnson's "How the Other Half Lives," longtime friends Jamellah and Fernecia are having trouble with the men in their lives. And as their worlds seem to crumble, they must count on their friendship to keep it together. In "Love Is 2 Blame," by V. Anthony Rivers, Malcolm is devastated after his two-year relationship with Shaylisa ends. And trying to move on will not be easy -- but the lovely Zahara may be the perfect woman to show Malcolm what true love is all about. In Zane's "Staring Evil in the Face," Robier has everything: a successful career, beautiful children, and the woman of his dreams. Having loved Tiphanie since college, he is determined to keep his marital vows -- until Tiphanie is involved in a horrible car accident that changes the entire course of their lives. From nervous breakdowns to drug addiction, in Love Is Never Painless, Zane, Johnson, and Rivers have penned powerful stories that not only will have readers talking, but will bring a new perspective to their own relationships.
