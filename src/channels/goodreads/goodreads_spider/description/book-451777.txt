451777:::::One Nation Under God:::::In the year 2021, eleven-year old Mary Christopher is the spunky daughter of the latest President vowing to return America to its righteous roots. Her mother is a well-known ?family values? activist, and her Uncle Gene Sisco is head of the largest evangelical Christian organization in the land. Against the backdrop of an America where Christian fundamentalism has brought about tremendous change in Washington, Mary's is a conflicted coming-of-age story, in which she questions everything from her faith to her sexuality, and ultimately becomes one more victim of her father's repressive legislation. Other figures in her life include: Jude, an atheist Mary befriends on the Internet; Vicki, the girl at camp for whom Mary develops confusing feelings; J. E. Cooper, the freelance reporter who labels Gene Sisco the most dangerous man in America; and Jefferson Paine, the mysterious figure behind the infamous Voice of Reason website, dedicated to challenging the Christopher administration at every turn. The novel takes events from present-day and extrapolates them to a possible conclusion two short decades from now. The list of controversial topics in this fable is long, covering everything from radical education techniques to communal living, group marriages to the failings of religion. Yet, through it all, ONE NATION UNDER GOD maintains a positive world-view, a hope that our society might one day get its collective act together, before it's too late.
