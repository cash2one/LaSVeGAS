11372681:::::His Purrfect Mate:::::Shannon is a quarter puma but can't shift. She's just a human with a few extra genes. But she knows how dangerous shifters are and now she's their prey, captured by a group of werewolves for a deadly hunt. Then she's rescued by the biggest werewolf of them all. He's the sexiest male she's ever seen-jet-black hair, muscular body, piercing dark eyes and a growl that heats her blood. Anton's body responds fervently to Shannon and he vows to protect her with his life-only to discover she's the enemy. As the future alpha of his pack, Anton knows a cat will never be accepted. There'll be hell to pay. But it's mating heat, and he's about to lose all control to that driving sexual need. His wolf wants her, can smell her desire. There's no way to stop it now-his animal won't be denied. Reader Advisory: This book contains a violent, graphic near-rape scene that is not for the faint of heart.
