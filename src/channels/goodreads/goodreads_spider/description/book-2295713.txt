2295713:::::Four Truths and a Lie:::::Eighth grader Scarlett is boy crazy -- and not just a little boy crazy. We're talking seriously, utterly, completely, 100-percent boy crazy! So much so that her mother, in an effort to curb Scarlett's enthusiasm, ships her off to a prestigious all-girls charter school. Scarlett thinks her life is absolutely over. But what she doesn't know is that her life is about to get absolutely interesting, because on her desk in her dorm room she finds a letter. The letter says it contains four truths and a lie -- and Scarlett's reputation depends on determining which is which.... Maybe an all-girls school isn't so boring after all.
