10589240:::::The Perennial Wanderer: An American in the World:::::Many authors, in satisfying the reading public s insatiable need for escapist literature, invest much time and money in their efforts. Don t get me wrong I read that literature myself. Why not? It is usually entertaining, if not suspenseful. In The Perennial Wanderer: An American in the World, however, it is my intent to demonstrate that life is indeed stranger than fiction, and I, not unlike the escapist writers, have invested much time and energy in bringing these life experiences to the reader. After working in so many countries including war torn and conflictive countries such as Viet Nam, Colombia, Per , Mozambique, Sudan and El Salvador I have seen more than my share of violence, murder, mayhem, public corruption and chicanery. And none of my observations have taken place as a military man my military experience, by the way, was in the peacetime Air Force in the beautiful Hawaiian Islands.
