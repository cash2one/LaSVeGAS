17740960:::::The Secret Lives of People: Real Diary Excerpts from Modern Day America:::::This book is an anonymous collection of real diary entries received from people who responded to an ad on Craigslist.org. It contains true personal stories written by a variety of different women, and captures the love, heartbreak, and raw emotion that they experience in their lives and within their relationships. Have you ever wondered what makes people tick? Or if you're normal? This book is full of genuine "dear diary" entries where women talk about their innermost thoughts - they confess what it feels like to have an affair, experiment with cutting, lose their virginity, participate in group sex, have an abortion, struggle with mental illness, or lose a friend to suicide. These are the sometimes funny, sometimes sad, and always fascinating real life private experiences that expose "The Secret Lives of People." The book is part "The Diary of Anne Frank," if it were written in modern-day America by a variety of adult women, and part "Mortified Nation," with a little bit of "50 Shades of Gray" thrown in for good measure. The book gives readers the guilty pleasure of reading a stranger's diary, while at the same time, giving a voice to people who wanted to share their deepest secrets, without the fear of judgment. Book is NOT suitable for minors.
