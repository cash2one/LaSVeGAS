13542909:::::The Introvert's Way: Living a Quiet Life in a Noisy World:::::Introversion Is a Gift. This clever and pithy book challenges introverts to take ownership of their personalities...with quiet strength. Sophia Dembling asserts that the introvert s lifestyle is not wrong or lacking, as society or extroverts would have us believe. Through a combination of personal insights and psychology, The Introvert s Way helps and encourages introverts to embrace their nature, to respect traits they may have been ashamed of and reframe them as assets. You re not shy; rather, you appreciate the joys of quiet. You re not antisocial; instead, you enjoy recharging through time alone. You re not unfriendly, but you do find more meaning in one-on-one connections than large gatherings. By honoring what makes them unique, this astute and inspiring book challenges introverts to own their introversion, igniting a quiet revolution that will change how they see themselves and how they engage with the world.
