I told myself not to laugh, especially not a snorting kind of laugh. "Wha . . . what did . . ." And then he kissed me. Charlotte (Charlie to her friends) finds herself falling for a boy who is off-limits. Her best friend is in love with him, and her mother and his father are dating. Still , Charlie can't help but wonder, what would happen if we kiss?
