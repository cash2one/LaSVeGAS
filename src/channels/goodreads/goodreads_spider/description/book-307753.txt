307753:::::The Love Potion:::::Hijinks ensue when a beautiful chemist unwittingly tests her new love potion on a wildly handsome lawyer. A love potion in a jelly bean? Yep! Fame and fortune are surely only a swallow away when Dr. Sylvie Fontaine discovers a chemical formula guaranteed to attract the opposite sex. Though her own love life is purely hypothetical, the shy chemist's professional future is assured ... as soon as she can find a human guinea pig. The only problem is the wrong man has swallowed Sylvie's love potion. Bad boy Lucien LeDeux is more than she can handle even before he's dosed with the Jelly Bean Fix. The wildly virile lawyer is the last person she'd choose to subject to the scientific method. When the dust settles, Sylvie and Luc have the answers to some burning questions-Can a man die of testosterone overload? Can a straight-laced female lose every single one of her inhibitions?-and they learn that old-fashioned romance is still the best catalyst for love.
