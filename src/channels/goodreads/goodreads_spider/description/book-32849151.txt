32849151:::::Emerald:::::"After hearing the story about the disappearance of the 98.98 carat Wittelsbach Emerald my imagination led me to write Emerald, the first in a series of thrillers based on fabulous gemstones. In this suspense novel, two Mossad Case Officers create a unique team to solve the mystery and mayhem linked to this emerald. Emerald has more twists and turns than a Swiss mountain road and around each bend is another fascinating and potentially dangerous character." The second of the Gemstone Thriller series, Diamond, is soon to be rolling off the press." "Currently being outlined and researched are hair-raisers about rubies in Myanmar; a sapphire in D.C.; and pearls in Tonga."
