13613274:::::How to Plant a Body:::::How to Plant a Body A SHOVEL FULL OF SUSPECTS Sarcastic by nature, Lily Aster s morning just went from bad to worse. A dead body has been discovered by employee, Joey Emerson in her family s flower shop s greenhouse. Greeting Lily as she tries to get inside, is Detective Anthony Falcetti, the guy in charge . . . now. Lily instantly falls into extreme dislike for the man and the feelings are quite mutual. Her sister Angelica simply wants to get inside, clean up the place and get on with their work day. Not today! Owen and Iris Aster own Aster s Offerings and have spent more than thirty-five years building it up to the tremendous success it is. Problem? Dead bodies tend to bring business to a screeching halt. Add to that a daughter who is hell-bent on finding out who is responsible while trying to outdo and out-sleuth a seasoned detective, and finding herself oddly attracted to him. Something she is not very proud of. Lily finds herself knee-deep in an investigation Detective Falcetti is trying his best to keep her as far away from as is humanly possible. Personalities clash, clues are uncovered, feelings are hurt, emotions are set on high and lust is in the air. With a quick wit and sharpened tongue, Lily Aster brings readers into her world and gives them something to laugh at while enjoying a great, old-fashioned who-dun-it!
