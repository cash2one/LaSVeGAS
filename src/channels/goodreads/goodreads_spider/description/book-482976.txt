It cuts right to the heart of life... If you miss A Tree Grows in Brooklyn you will deny yourself a rich experience... It is a poignant and deeply understanding story of childhood and family relationships. The Nolans lived in the Williamsburg slums of Brooklyn from 1902 until 1919... Their daughter, Francie, and their son, Neely, know more than their fair share of the privations and sufferings that are the lot of a great city's poor. Primarily this is Francie's book. She is a superb feat of characterization, an imaginative, alert, resourceful child. And Francie's growing up and beginnings of wisdom are the substance of A Tree Grows in Brooklyn ." - Orville Prescott "[ A Tree Grows in Brooklyn ] is that rare and enduring thing, a book in which, no matter our backgrounds, we recognize ourselves." - Anna Quindlen , from her Foreword This P.S. edition features an extra 16 pages of insights into the book, including author interviews, recommended reading, and more.
