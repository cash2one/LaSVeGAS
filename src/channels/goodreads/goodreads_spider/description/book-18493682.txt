18493682:::::A Treatise on Hijab:::::No one denies that the modesty which is commanded by Islamic Law and by convention includes the decency and decorousness demanded of a woman and the kind of behaviour that will ensure that she is kept far away from situations of temptation and suspicion. Furthermore, there is no doubt that the greatest act of modesty that she can perform is to wear the hijab, which covers her face. It is the best thing with which she can adorn herself, because it protects Her and keeps her far removed from temptation.
