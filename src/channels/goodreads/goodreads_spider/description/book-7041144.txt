7041144:::::Death Wish:::::Most people don t think about death until they are faced with it. In most cases they try to stay out of death s way, but not me. I welcomed death. To me it seemed like the comfort of a warm blanket wrapping around me. I just never figured when it came I would let it in through the front door, my arms open wide embracing it with love and affection. I wasn t always this way. I used to have it all, a husband, a child, a career. I used to have a life. After the death of her family Lena Mathews moves to Alaska to block out her past, taking a job as a phlebotomist at V.09 Laboratories. She meets Rob. He s every woman s dream: gorgeous, rich, and sexy, only he s not a man, he s a vampire. A vampire holding a secret that will change Lena s life forever.
