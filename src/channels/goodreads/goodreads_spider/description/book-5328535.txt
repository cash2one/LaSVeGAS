Robyn Young s historical fiction has topped international bestseller lists and won praise from the likes of Raymond Khoury, Steve Berry, and Alison Weir.

Leaving the Christian empire in the East in ruins, Knight Templar Will Campbell returns to the West to discover that the Temple has forged an alliance with his enemy, King Edward of England, vowing to help the king wage war on Scotland. This pact against his homeland strikes at the core of Will s faith and allegiances, while his daughter, Rose, is led into a dangerous affair in the French royal household. Will now faces a choice: Should he protect his family, or lead his men into a new world? The fight for the Holy Land has ended. But the Temple s last battle has just begun.
