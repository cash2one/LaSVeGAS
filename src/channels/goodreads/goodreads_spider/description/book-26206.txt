26206:::::Me Vs. Me:::::Gabby Wolf has pretty much, almost definitely (this close!) come to a decision: She's trading in Phoenix (nice but uneventful life with boyfriend) for Manhattan (dream job as producer for highly successful news show). Then Cam swoops in and gives her a sparkling engagement ring, making her decision even more impossible. Husband vs. career. Vera Wang wedding dress vs. sexy first-date outfits. Planting roots in Phoenix vs. playing the field in Manhattan She wishes she didn't have to decide, that she could have it all. She never expects her wish to come true. Suddenly Gabby's living two lives. Whenever she falls asleep in one, she wakes up in the other. She's got the best of both worlds and what more could a girl ask for? Right?
