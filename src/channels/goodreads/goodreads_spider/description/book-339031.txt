339031:::::Akhenaten:::::This is a recreation of the life of Akhenaten, Nefertiti's husband, which tells the story of his reign from 1378 to 1362 BC. In spite of attempts to eradicate all traces of his reign, enough exists to tell a story of incest, heresy, androgyny and a massive cult of personality.
