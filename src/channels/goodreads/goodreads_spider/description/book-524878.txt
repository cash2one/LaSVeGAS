524878:::::Without Reservations: The Travels of an Independent Woman:::::"In many ways, I was an independent woman," writes Pulitzer Prize winning journalist Alice Steinbach. For years I d made my own choices, paid my own bills, shoveled my own snow. But somehow she had become dependent in quite another way. I had fallen into the habit of defining myself in terms of who I was to other people and what they expected of me. But who was she away from the people and things that defined her? In this exquisite book, Steinbach searches for the answer to this question in some of the most beautiful and exciting places in the world: Paris, where she finds a soul mate; Oxford, where she takes a course on the English village; and Milan, where she befriends a young woman about to be married. Beautifully illustrated with postcards from Steinbach s journeys, this revealing and witty book transports you into a fascinating inner and outer journey, an unforgettable voyage of discovery.
